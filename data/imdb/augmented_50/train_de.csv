0,there is no relation at all between fortier and profiler but the fact that both are police series about violent crimes profiler looks crispy fortier looks classic profiler plots are quite simple fortiers plot are far more complicated fortier looks more like prime suspect if we have to spot similarities the main character is weak and weirdo but have clairvoyance people like to compare to judge to evaluate how about just enjoying funny thing too people writing fortier looks american but on the other hand arguing they prefer american series  maybe it is the language or the spirit but i think this series is more english than american by the way the actors are really good and funny the acting is not superficial at all,1
1,this movie is a great the plot is very true to the book which is a classic written by mark twain the movie starts of with a scene where hank sings a song with a bunch of kids called when you stub your toe on the moon it reminds me of sinatras song high hopes it is fun and inspirational the music is great throughout and my favorite song is sung by the king hank bing crosby and sir saggy sagamore overall a great family movie or even a great date movie this is a movie you can watch over and over again the princess played by rhonda fleming is gorgeous i love this movie if you liked danny kaye in the court jester then you will definitely like this movie,1
2,george p cosmatos rambo first blood part ii is pure wishfulfillment the united states clearly did not win the war in vietnam they caused damage to this country beyond the imaginable and this movie continues the fairy story of the ohso innocent soldiers the only bad guys were the leaders of the nation who made this war happen the character of rambo is perfect to notice this he is extremely patriotic bemoans that usamericans did not appreciate and celebrate the achievements of the single soldier but has nothing but distrust for leading officers and politicians like every film that defends the war eg we were soldiers also this one avoids the need to give a comprehensible reason for the engagement in south asia and for that matter also the reason for every single usamerican soldier that was there instead rambo gets to take revenge for the wounds of a whole nation it would have been better to work on how to deal with the memories rather than suppressing them do we get to win this time yes you do,0
3,in the process of trying to establish the audiences empathy with jake roedel tobey maguire the filmmakers slander the north and the jayhawkers missouri never withdrew from the union and the union army was not an invading force the southerners fought for states rights the right to own slaves elect crooked legislatures and judges and employ a political spoils system there is nothing noble in that the missourians could have easily traveled east and joined the confederate armyit seems to me that the story has nothing to do with ambiguity when jake leaves the bushwhackers it is not because he saw error in his way he certainly does not give himself over to the virtue of the because of abolition,1
4,yeh i know  you are quivering with excitement well the secret lives of dentists will not upset your expectations it is solidly made but essentially unimaginative truthful but dull it concerns the story of a married couple who happen to be dentists and who share the same practice already a recipe for trouble if it was not for our separate worklives we would all ditch our spouses out of sheer irritation campbell scott whose mustache and demeanor do not recall everyman so much as ned flanders from the simpsons is the mildmannered uberdad husband and hope davis is the boredstiff housewife who channels her frustrations into amateur opera one night as dad  the daughters attend one of davis performances he discovers that his wife is channeling her frustrations into more than just singing he witnesses his wife kissing and flirting with the director of opera one nice touch we never see the operadirectors face dreading the prospect of instituting the proceedings for separation divorce and custody hearings  profitable only to the lawyers  scott chooses to pretend ignorance of his wifes indiscretionsalready the literate among you are starting to yawn hohum another story about the pathetic sniveling little cuckold but rudolph who took the story from a jane smiley novella hopes that the wellwornness of the material will be compensated for by a series of flashy postmodern touches for instance one of scotts belligerent patients denis leary kept relatively  and blessedly  in check will later become a sort of construction of the dentists imagination emerging as a devilontheshoulder advocate for the oldfashioned masculine virtues dump the bh etc when not eggedon by his imaginary new buddy scott is otherwise tormented by fantasies that include his wife engaged in a threeway with two of the male dentalassistants who work in their practice it is not going too far to say that this movie is eyes wide shut for real people or grownups at least along those lines campbell scott and hope davis are certainly recognizable human beings as compared to the glamourpuss pair of cruise and kidman further the script for secret lives is clearly more relevant than kubricks as proof i offer the depiction of the dentists children particularly the youngest one who is about three or four years old and whose main utterance is dad dad dad dad dad dad this is family life all right with all its charmsthe movie would make an interesting doublebill with kramer vs kramer as well one can easily trace the feminization of the american male from one thousand nine hundred and seventynine to two thousand and three in this movie dad is the housewife as in kramer but he is in no way flustered by the domestic role unlike dustin hoffman who was too manly to make toast here scott gets all the plumb chores such as wiping up the childrens vomit cooking cleaning taking the kids to whatever inane afterschool activity is on the docket and all without complaint and without directorial commentary it is just taken for grantedthe film has virtues mostly having to do with verisimilitude however it is dragged down from greatness by its insistence on trendy distractions which culminate in a long scene where a horrible fiveday stomach flu makes the rounds in the household we must endure pointless fantasy sequences initiated by the imaginary ringleader leary whose existence by the way is finally reminiscent of the brad pitt character in fight club and this finally drives home the films other big flaw lack of originality in this review i realize it is been far too easy to reference many other films granted this film is an improvement on most of them but still the secret lives of dentists is worth seeing but do not get too excited about it not that you were all that excited anyway i guess,0
5,while this movies style is not as understated and realistic as a sound version probably would have been this is still a very good film in fact it was seen as an excellent film in its day as it was nominated for the first best picture oscar losing to wings i still consider wings to be a superior film but this one is excellent despite a little bit of overacting by the lead emil janningsjannings is a general from czarist russia who is living out his final days making a few bucks in the one thousand nine hundred and twentys by being a hollywood extra his luck appears to have changed as he gets a casting callto play an imperial russian general fighting against the communists during the revolution naturally this is not much of a stretch actingwise but it also gets the old man to thinking about the old days and the revolutionexactly what happens next i will leave to you but it is a pretty good filmparticularly at the end by the way look for william powell as the russian director despite being made in one thousand nine hundred and twentyeight with the makeup he does not look much younger than he did in many of his later films,1
6,i give this movie seven out of ten because the villains were interesting in their roles and the unknown batwoman creates an interesting guess who game the movie however needs more robin in it he appeared in the movie in the beginning and sporadically throughout the rest i always thought the new animated series did little justice to the neat new robin character let alone knightwing this movie just continues that bad tradition the movie spends too much time on bruce wayne and his romance which would not be so bad in one movie if the romance was not so unbelievable it is still a good movie if you are a batman fan and i would recommend watching it,1
7,really awful lead actor did ok the film plot etc was completely crap and inaccurate it may as well have been a sequel to well anything it had little or no relevance to carlitos way and should be avoided like the plague by any carlitos ways fans no mention of gail in fact he ends up with some other bird no mention of klienfelt no mention of how he got caught no mention of how he ended up in jail they attempted to make it like the original with flash backs at the beginning but to be honest when rating it i was looking for a zero mark unfortunately i had to rate it higherits a terrible attempt to cash in on what was one of the best films of the ninetys overall it was approximately £six and two hours of my life wasted for all the action in it it was truly boring slow and predictable again to any carltios way fans avoid this fiasco,0
8,good grief i cannot even begin to describe how poor this film is do not get me wrong i was not expecting much to begin with let us face it a pgthirteen slasher flick is predestined to be missing the ummm slashing so no one should be surprised by the lack of gore but it was the level of incompetence and cliché on display in all the other aspects of this movie is what really blew me away we have a protagonist who is quite simply so completely useless that you find yourself rooting for the bad guy and here is a turnup for the books she never changes  hence breaking the cardinal rule of basic screen writing  character development if you think by the end of this film the poor little girl is going to turn around and finally kick some arse then think again on top of this we are handed possibly the least intriguing and definitely the least scary killer ever to grace the genre i am not joking when i say that dora the explorer has scarier villains than this moviefinally because all the potential for tension or gratuity is removed by the inept and apparently thirteenyearold director what could possibly be left to fill up two hours of screen time closets that is what lots and lots of closets big closets small closets mirrored closets closets to narnia so many damned closets you will not want to dress yourself for another year in fact this movie should have just been called closet and had a picture of a big scary coathanger on the dvd case on the back it could have had a photograph of the audience falling asleep and a quote by roger and ebert  something to the extent of what the f did we just waste our time watching,0
9,home room deals with a columbinelike highschool shooting but rather than hashing over the occurrence itself the film portrays the aftermath and what happened to the survivors their trauma guilt and denialspoilers the shooting itself is treated as a foregone conclusion with no action footage other than the reaction of an almost teenage swat commando after shooting the high school killer the film has three protagonists the detective investigating the crime of which no guilty parties are left to convict and two teenage girls surviving the incident played by a very young erika christensen and busy philippsthe two girls having nothing in common besides the shooting are put together because of it and the drama ensueserika christensen though only twentyfour has been around the block so much that film viewers are pretty much acquainted with her solid and reliable style of acting busy philipps three years older than christensen and altogether unknown to me blew me away with her overwhelming dramatic strength and screen presence this girl was the partit is a great movie and it connects to you with its intimate focus on the fragile yet growing relationship between the two traumatized girls gus van sants elephant two thousand and three though good seems almost superficial and paltry compared to home room when it comes to dramatic flair and acting what i can see this film got very little screen time and exposure  so much more a loss for an equally traumatized americaten out of ten,1
10,this begins a wager between edgar allen poe and a journalistpoe bets that the man can not spend an entire night in a creepy castle well of course he can but will he come out unscathed hard to say with all these strange people that are not supposed to be there wandering around including the icy barbara steele this is a fairly odd film in that the presentation is both in french and english and switches back and forth a few times perhaps this is done because bits of dialog were lost it is also rather dark and claustrophobic being that one does not see much beyond a small circle of light that candles and such generate plus there is a feel of dread and impending doom pretty much at all times this version on synapse is also uncensored and i wondered what might be censored in a film from one thousand nine hundred and sixtyfour until i saw the topless scene i guess that might be it overall this is pretty good and in gloomy black and white barbara steele definitely makes the movie too eight out of ten,1
11,last weekend i bought this zombie movie from the bargain bin and watched it with some friends thinking it was going to be a budget version of land of the deadboy was i wrong it seems as if they spent a good portion of their budget on the coverart which is very misleading to fans of the zombie genrewe watched up to the point where the zombie chicks come alive and get in the car with some yuppie who is out in the middle of nowhere talking business on a cellphone they actually speak to the guy before one of the girls kills him but once they started driving the car i could not suspend my disbelief anymoresome people actually consider this a so bad it is good movie they are liars i did not finish the movie but one of the other reviews mention that they actually somehow become police officers at the end of the movie which makes me glad to not have watched it all the way throughthis is even worse than zombiez do not watch,0
12,well the reason for seeing it in the cinema was that it was a sneak preview else i would never have seen this terrible teenage slasher movie i mean have not we had enough of this yet scream and scary movie at least did not take them self serious the plot sucks and the acting is the worst i have seen only godzilla can compare which is also the only movie that competes in being the worst i have seen in the cinema with this onethere is so many plot holes in the story and the girls are so alike that you do not even now who has been killed and who has not and you do not care the only of them i knew in advance was denise and she was the most talent less actress i have ever seen in this bad excuse for a moviestay as far away from this movie as possible twoten,0
13,we have an average family dads a famous rapper we have the rebelious teenage daughter the adopted white kid and the cute little kid and we have careless housemaid what show has had a housemaid like that do we have a messedup brady bunch yay when it first came out i thought it was really cool mostly because i was young the music was bad the raps were so bad and they were too grated all of his raps were about his family and friends and problems the dad was kind of the danny from full house type of dad always gave the advice out but he was not a clean freak they had a housekeeper for that remember the plots were basically lil romeo was in trouble of some sort or not that is it oh and maybe some preteen drama yeah that stuff is good not really but its still a good show for kids but nikelodean could do better,0
14,when my sister said this movie was going to be good i had second thoughts but i watched it and it was actually funny basically the movie is made of a weird girl who goes to a small town where no one likes her and she just wants to go there and get the reading of her aunts will don so she can go but its not all that easy in this movie you will come across hilarious humor a witch a book of spellsrecopies a mentally challenged uncle and a dog you will understand the meaning of the word freak a after anyways i hope you run right out and try to find this really old movie hope you like it in total i will have to give it a zero no i am totally joking ill give it a nine hope you understand that you will laugh you will scream and you may just be offendedlove yours truly dakota you can email me at dakotalovesithot mailcom if you want to,1
15,i thought this was a wonderful movie it touches every fiber of a human being the love in the film is very intense i thought it was wills best performance to date great directing liked the editing music was great good use of flashback this is the kind of movie everyone should go see i hope people will get something wonderful from this overall excellent movie i think hollywood should make more movies with substance even action films can have a caring story i like the fact that will was very subtle in his acting he had a purpose and a dedication that is rare to see i would suggest watching this alone or with someone that you really care about for me i found that the world stopped and my only focus was on the film the outside world was suspended for a moment it was a nice feeling with all this chaos going on in this world and with this me generation it was great to see somethingsomeone that cared about other people more than himself,1
16,why on earth is colin firth in this pointless film has he really been that strapped for cashthe film is not clear on what it wants to be about grief exotic places ghosts a vehicle for mr darcy it is a muddled muddy messthere seems to be some sort of idea that italy must be good in itself and that italian has something to offer as a language  but in the end the girls just want to go back to yanklandthere are pointless episodes on the beach in churches on busy roads  but what it is all about or why anybody should care simply is not clearthere was also a yank woman in the film it was not clear what here job was but she seemed only to be there to make vapid inappropriate and maudlin comments to the girl was it supposed to be about paedophilliaa pretty dreadful mess all in all i gave it two rather than one because it does not have the charm of an utterly ghastly film,0
17,back in one thousand nine hundred and eightyfive i caught this thing i cannot even call it a movie on cable i was in college and i was with a high school friend whose hormones were raging out of control i figured out early on that this was hopeless stupid script a bunch of old guys hiring some young guys to show them how to score with women bad acting with one exception and pathetic jokes the plentiful female nudity here kept my friend happy for a whilebut even he was bored after thirty minutes in rememberthis was a high school boy this was back before nudity was so easy to get to by the internet and such we kept watching hoping for something interesting or funny but that never happened the funniest thing about this was the original ad campaign in which the studio admitted this film was crap one poster had a fictional review that said this is the best movie i have seen this afternoon only grant cramer in the lead showed any talent and has actually gone on to a career in the business nobudget and boring ta skip it,0
18,it is easy to forget once later series had developed the alien conspiracy plot arc more that once upon a time the xfiles wrote episodes like genderbender and fearful symmetry where the aliens were not all little grey men or mindcontrol goop but could actually surprise youfearful symmetry starts with an invisible elephant  actually an elephant somehow dislocated in space and time not a mile away from the walk  and ends with a pregnant gorilla being abducted and it is very much an episode of wonderful moments the subplot is annoyingly worthy  yeah we get it zoos are bad except when they are not  but the ideas that within it are fascinating visually powerful and very memorable and it covers an angle on abduction that is largely overlooked  why would humans be the only things that aliens are interested inin the end it was not an instant classic but it was enjoyable viewing while it lasted again very memorable and mainly it is something that you could not imagine many other shows doing,1
19,grey gardensone thousand nine hundred and seventyfive is the maysles brothers bizarre documentary of jackie bouvier kennedy onassiseccentric aunt and first cousin who live like pigs in a run down twentyeight room mansion on east hampton long islandbig edie bouvier bealeseventyeightwitty and dry and her daughter little edie bealefiftysixemotionally about thirteen a still beautiful woman who once had a promising futurelive in isolation from the rest of the world except for their many cats and raccoons in the attic they amuse themselves by bickering all day listening to the radio or singing to each otherthey do not even own a television their fall from society is amazing to learn of and the viewer is drawn to these two very special although obviously dysfunctional peopleone of the better documentaries ever made and still a cult classic today,1
20,i am usually not one to say that a film is not worth watching but this is certainly an extenuating circumstance the only true upside to this film is cornelia sharpe looking rather attractive and the fact that this film is really shortthe plot in the film is unbelievably boring and goes virtually nowhere throughout the film none of the characters are even remotely interesting and there is no reason to care about anyone i am not sure why on earth sean connery agreed to do this film but he should have definitely passed on this onethe only reason i could see for seeing this film is if you are a diehard sean connery fan and simply want to see everything he is done save this one for last thoughwell if you by some miracle end up seeing this despite my review or any of the other reviews on this site then i hope you enjoy it more than i did thanks for reading,0
21,not funny  how can anyone link this to monty python that is absolutely ridiculous  there are no laughs this is not funny over the top but ugly weird just for weird sake and it seems to me these people were on something all the time unfortunately something that did not make them funnyit should be given some points for effort etc whatever actually it appears there is a laugh track  or is there one hummm since there are barely any laughs that is a debatable questionmaybe i am doing it injustice  maybe it is some sort of exercise some sort of art  in that case anything goes never mindbut these guys playing women with highpitched voices turnedup noses come on  not funny there is only one heir apparent to monty pythons intellectual wit and that is stephen colbert and maybe jon stewart,0
22,okay i rented this movie because of the directorhe has made some interesting flicks in the past if you have not seen waxork you are missing a fun ride anyway i had my doubts about this movie from the beginning but i decided to suck it up and give it a look it is bad very bad if you have not seen the movie and do not mind spoilers read ahead first of all the old saying you cannot judge a book by it is cover applies here the box for this flick seems to indicate that jill is the stone fox with long hair with highlights the back of the box has a cool shot of the redleather jill and some other shots the description makes you want to rent the movie because it sounds good you start watching it and suddenly you find out that the movie takes place inexplicably in one thousand nine hundred and seventyseven jill is a total dog who is not the girl on the cover the movie is not quite as predictable as you would thinkand that is not a good thing characters do so many stupid things without any modicum of motivationit is embarrassing to watch ten minutes before the end of the movie dolph and another lady have sex for no good reason also what was the point of having dolph kill this other lady in cold blood who had been helping him anthony hickox the director should have seen a stinker when he read the script had it been set in the underworld of the new milennium and made the characters halfway intelligent it might have been decent to set it in the seventys makes no sense and has no bearing on the story whatsoever avoid it,0
23,this obscure de sica delivers the goods and it is said the meek shall inherit the earth this tale of classes on the surface but really an allegory for all the homeless people that populated europe after the great war they are homeless but cheerful in a societies too impoverished and selfish to care for or acknowledge them footmats for the italian carpetbaggers de sica chooses to tell it as a fairy tale a cinderella story i have not read the book it is based on so i cannot foresay if the deus ex machina is the construct of the writer or vittorio it begins with the words once upon a time to exemplify the timelessness of its tale for the story could be set anywhere and everywhere caricature sketches of the aristocracy that cut to the bone whimsical nature of the homeless especially when they begin to grant their wishes and an ending right out of a spielberg picture makes this boulange a delight for all de sicas most accessible picture is also one of his best abandoning neorealism he always dallied between that and pure good old filmmaking he creates a movie that breaks the heart and at the same time fills it with the yearning of hope that one needs to continue leaving in this world gracias vittorio gracias gracias gracias,1
24,wes craven you are having a laugh at our expense the red eye plot is preposterous we are confronted by a guy who has apparently spent eight weeks watching a girl who then turns up at an airport behind her flirts and chats her up successfully somehow wangles a seat next to her in a two seat space not trapped in the middle of a five seat row contacts at checkin and is cheezily nice during a painfully slooooow build up then once up in the air in a confined space surrounded by strangers he immediately starts threatening the vacuous if superefficient rachel mcadams and saying tosh like we got ya daddy do what i say or poppa gets it well forgive me but did not they already have her daddy ready for slaughtersoyoubetteroughta long before she stepped on the plane and therefore would not it have been oh sooooooo much simpler to simply snatch the gal off the street and terrorise her in a room somewhere forgetting the complicated and insecure dad plot pulling her nails out or whatever until she made the all important call required or even  cos this is the movies and we need a few unreal twists  keep the dumb dadindistress thing intact if you must but dress it up better so that holding him in harms way until the convoluted plot had been concluded made some sense without the plane dumbdown alternatively without wanting to sound like an actual thinking terroristassassin  could not the massive bazookamissile thang employed have been far more easily used on say a car driving down the highway with the politician inside rather than the fiftyth story of a miami seafront hotel from a fishing boat mind you as we already know security in miami is lax so they will speed away i know i know far more fun to go through watching a pretty girl for eight weeks burgle her dads house to steal his wallet that somehow  star trek style  gets transported from miami to texas instantly in order to  perhaps  get her to arrange for a politician to change hotel room and and and well a thousand things could go wrong here each one entirely destroying the big plan so why not slim the elements down to a sensible handful such as  one bazooka two car three boom my fifty minute drive home from the cinema was spent highlighting the abundance of flaws and stupid codhitchcockian twists which sadly was the best fun of the whole sorry experience and as for security back at miami airport we have an apparently crazy and violent girl running off a plane chased by cops who during the chase sits down to have a coffee moves elsewhere to read a magazine at a bar then runs again like crazy up and down the whole terminal by now also chased by crazed cillian murphy no cctv then  i had guns pulled on me for parking in the wrong place for ten seconds at miami airport a couple of years back so instead of speaking to the cops  her allies  or getting on the blower at a callbox direct to her dad to warn him his life is in danger mcadams prefers instead to steal a people carrier off a family in the airport forecourt call the damned security and drives home to daddy mowing down the assassin with the vehicle in the front garden of the house in a rich neighbourhoodwatch district crushing the front porch in the process  an act which actually slightly wakes dad up from an afternoon snooze after about a minute yet which somehow fails to register with neighbours who are not even mildly curious thus ensuring fifteen more minutes of hide and seek shenanigans as the duo run around the vast hollodeck type house dohhh it actually hurts to keep thinking about it all  cillian surely renamed silly un for doing this one preposterously turns from ice assassin to comically unhinged and inept lunatic killer at the end this theoretically ruthless despatcher of human life now allowing the dad to live so that he can watch his daughter getting her goose cooked i would better stop because the stream of drivel i am writing here must sound as uncoordinated as the red eye script if ms mcadams had not been allowed to get on the plane in the first place the title could have been altered from red eye to no eye dear rr,0
25,i love horses and admire hand drawn animation so i expected nothing short of amazement from dreamworks new animated picture spirit stallion of the cimarron i guess you could say i was a little bit disappointed you have wonderful animation and at first what seems like a perfect story a story about absolutely nothing but a horse in nature the animals do not sing cute songs or even talk  a major plus sadly the film has an uncalled for narration by matt damon a sappy soundtrack by bryan adams and enough action scenes to compare it to a jerry bruckheimer production if the film makers would have just stayed with simplicity we would have a masterpiece here this is not a great film but it is good entertainment for small children i would recommend this film to families because it has its heart in the right place and its the only thing out there right now that is not offensive to small children not bad but could have been much better very pretty visuals though,1
26,the first and only time i saw shades was during a sneakpreview it had not even been in premiere i remember there was someone of the directors staff there do not even remember who it was a belgian movie we never heard of it so we were quite neutral not knowing what to expect mickey rourke is a brilliant actor and he is stands miles ahead all the rest he plays an actor who is star has long stopped rising he is helping to realise a movie in belgium entitled shadesas soon as the movie started we noticed how much swearing there is nothing against the occasional swear word however this was way beyond annoying whenever rourke uses the f word to express something it comes naturally however when someone from the cast a nonenglish speaker uses the f or s word it becomes arrogant and aggressivewe quickly lost count of how many times they used the f and s words everybody was just glad to be out of the theatre and we had to give a vote but it was hard for us because it was only from zero to ten and we were looking for the ten,0
27,i seriously love this film so much i never get sick of watching it the only line i really cannot stomach in this is when riff calls herself a teenage lobotomy but other than that everything else is perfect i have never been a fan of pj soles and it did not help to hear that she did not even know who the ramones were until she filmed this movie but i can ignore her snarly little face for the most part most people who watch this over and over are fans of the ramones and really that is the only reason i love it so much i never get tired of seeing deedee mess up his pizza lines or joey mess up the name of the teacher over and over haha one of the best parts of the film is seeing them sing do you want to dance  down the halls of the high school i love it the special edition dvd has a good retrospective surprisingly pj soles is not on it maybe she was working on another project laugh anyway great film even better if you are a ramones fan,1
28,this is the best scifi that i have seen in my twentynine years of watching scifi i also believe that dark angel will become a cult favorite the action is great but jessica alba is the best and most gorgeous star on tv today,1
29,it is good to see that vintage film buff have correctly categorized their excellent dvd release as a musical for that is what this film is pure and simple like its unofficial remake murder at the windmill one thousand nine hundred and fortynine the murder plot is just an excuse for an elaborate girlie show with kitty carlisle and gertrude michael leading a cast of superdecorative girls including ann sheridan lucy ball beryl wallace gwenllian gill gladys young barbara fritchie wanda perry and dorothy white carl brisson is also on hand to lend his strong voice to cocktails for two undoubtedly the movies most popular song it is heard no less than four times however it is gertrude michael who steals the show not only with her rendition of sweet marijauna but her strong performance as the heros rejected girlfriend as for the rest of the cast we could have done without jack oakie and victor mclaglen altogether the only good thing about oakies role is his weak running gag with cult icon toby wing in fact to give you an idea as to how far the rest of the comedy is overindulged and overstrained superdumb inspector mclaglen simply cannot put his hands on the killer even though would you believe in this instance it happens to be the person you most suspect director mitch leisen actually goes to great pains to point the killer out to even the dumbest member of the cinema audience by giving the player concerned closeup after closeup,1
30,i just finished watching this movie it was not ridiculously bad but i am really disappointed with it i am not really sure why someone would make a movie like this it was marginally entertaining but i feel like the people making it had a lot of disagreements on what they were making monday the writer was in charge tuesday the director wednesday the guy who gets the coffee etc it almost seems like they really wanted to make a couple different movies but only had the time and money to make onesomeone else commented that the acting was really good but i would have to disagree then again if the actors were able to keep a straight face during the filming perhaps they are better actors than i give them credit forthe back of the dvd gives the impression that the movie would be a mystery something along the lines of a historical law and order or national treasure it starts off like that but then out of nowhere it takes a turn towards a bad episode of the twilight zone or what was that other show that was not as good a bad episode of the outer limitsmy main complaint about the movie is that it is just so played out there is the evil guy with spiked white hair there is the love interest who when she first appears the wind actually blows through her hair seriously once you realize it is a christian movie the end is also pretty easy to spotthe cinematography was poorly done especially in the opening scenes  way to put your best foot forward it was not atrocious for most of the movie but there was the occasional ridiculously bad shot of an old lady praying arms up in a dark room while lightening is striking  the sort of thing that just makes you a little bit embarrassed to be watching the movie,0
31,slither is a horror comedy that does not really have enough horror or comedy to qualify as one or the other it has one scene that is exceptionally good any number of zingers that work but very few real scares and not enough humor to maintain the movie in addition the script does not focus on the hero and heroine and goes off kilter in several placesa major failing of this film is that it introduces and then leaves its hero fillion to follow grant grant michael rooker as he is first introduced and then becomes the monster this whole part of the film drags  michael rookers character is not that interesting to us as a person and watching as he goes through a series of motions while acting in the monsters interest might be interesting if this was grant  portrait of a man turning into a monster rather than a horrorcomedy alien invasion movie in the final analysis this movies problems are in the script  it is not that important to the audience how the monster acts or propagates the purpose of a horrorcomedy is to get the heroes backed up in a corner with shotguns and then throw bugs at them with them cracking wise every time something frightening or disgusting happens instead we get an exploration of the aliens habits and tactics that just makes this part of the movie drag the ostensible heroine elizabeth banks as starla grant is more central to this part but nonetheless i felt the movie had left its narrative track unless it planned on following grant grant all the way to the endwhen fillion and his posse finally confront the alien the movie does begin to cook but once again the problem is in the script by this point that audience knows  and the characters should know  that grant is not just suffering from some disease and act accordingly shotguns  instead they continuously parley in the face of increasing evidence that this is not something that let us get you to a hospital is going to help although their reactions might have been human and real these are characters in an action movie and simply should have done what the movie promised  delivered action a lack of action scenes in a movie with as few ideas as this is a great failing spoilers ahead  after the first confrontation and the bursting of the alien larval sack a minor character and perhaps the best scene in the movie the script once again betrays the movie at this point one of the characters is almost taken over by the alien and develops an insight into the alien the writerdirector gunn chooses as this character a completely new character rather than one of already developed minor characters why why did he need to introduce a completely new character more than an hour into the movie that becomes central to the plot by the time this character is attacked we know hardly anything about her and could care less about her even though she is a winsome teenage girl in her bath had gunn decided not to use this character and just used one of the established minor characters he could have completely avoided introducing her family and saved time and money furthermore the hero and heroine would have been filled in on the aliens plans without all the additional characters and could have gotten around to blowing away aliens sooner and with more vigormy last criticism is based on the movies look gunn is primarily a writer or maybe it was budgetary constraints but this movie looked ugly and uninteresting most of the action takes place at night in woods or on a field and the screen simply looks drab the sets in wheelsy the fictional town where the action takes place look cheap the whole movie looks cheap box office mojo states the films budget was fifteen million newspapers say twentynine million and considering they did not use any name talent i would say the money did not show up on screen the monster is just repulsive and rarely looks deadlythe last criticism is primarily based on the reality of the characters actions by the time fillion and co have begun hunting grantthe alien one woman has disappeared and grant is known to have been mutilating animals at this point i was expecting the fbi or at least the state police to show up and take over from the hick sheriff a woman has disappeared and likely been murdered and a local has been acting psychotic time to call the authorities but basically i was hoping that would happen because i just wanted some characters who would show up and actalthough this movie is ostensibly a horrorcomedy the movie it bears the most resemblance to is dreamcatcher in terms of monstrous invasion and the type of monster and its intentions whereas dreamcatcher had much bigger problems with story especially the entire morgan freeman subplot and particularly the ending in many ways it was stronger primarily because the main characters were stronger but more importantly because it looked beautiful although that may be anathema  preferring the movie that is weaker in general plot and structural spine because of production values  that just shows you how uninteresting i found the look of slither,0
32,gus van sant has made some excellent films i truly am a fanhowever i cannot help but feel that the cerebral edge of tom robbins book even cowgirls get the blues is lost in translation to the big screen alone tom robbins and gus van sant are incredible visionaries and towers of talent ultimately though this one just did not work it was not that the characters were not well developed or the plot and content did not come alive it is just that our imaginations are much more powerful when reading a book like this we are taken away to a different time and place and we sometimes think the worst andor the best and it adds to the overall rollercoaster of the book as it neatly unfolds according to the authors precision movies however can leave one with less of the imagination and emotion rollercoaster detracting from the overall experience this is what i believe happened herei suggest reading the book,1
33,what an appalling piece of rubbish who are all these people who blubber on about how good this is yes it is arty and yes it is foreign but  that is not enough the plot is boring and disjointed like a reality show but not so slickly madethe people are intrinsically uninteresting but as characters they do not have enough depth to feel empathy for them if they are based on real people then i feel very very sorry for themthe violence and some of it is very violent seems quite ostentatious and gratuitous it is like the producer has visions of being quenton tarantino not that i think very much of him eitherand oh yes if i had neighbours like these i would move,0
34,this is a formula b science fiction movie and the director made no bones about it it is about a dragon who is restored to life by a scientific team everything done is stuff you have seen many times before it is a weak script with no real characters in fact it is full of stereotype characters and situations the director attacks this by just making it a formula movie with no attempt to fool us and that gives this movie a mild appeal but it is not something you are likely to remember a while it is best seen while you are cooking cleaning working out sort of mindless fun it has its place in entertainment but it certainly is not something you sit down with friends to watch unless you are all just drunk and do not care the mass rating of threetwo is probably fair i do not think it is as crappy as most people but i am surprised that some people in the postings thought this was spectacular that really eludes me as i see no attempt to even make this a memorable film,0
35,i was living rawlins when this movie was made and i got lucky enough to be able to work on it both as an extra and with eddie surkin on special effects it was fun to see all the behind the scene workings from the barbedwire coming alive to the electric chair up through the wardens office floor also it was a lot of fun getting to meet all the actors from viggo to tiny also the gate that was cut into the prison wall for the movie was and still is called disney gate by locals if anybody is interested and is ever in rawlins most of the movies sets are still in place and can be seen during the self guided tour it was a lot of fun working for and with r harlin and wished i had a chance to do it again,1
36,i think that my favorite part of this movie the one that exemplifies the sheer pointless stupidity and inanity of the proceedings comes at the climax of the film doctor ted nelson and his unmarried friend the sheriff have finally cornered the melting man on a landing on some stairs in an electrical generating plant keep in mind that nelson has been looking for the mm for nearly the entire film and that the mm has killed and eaten several people at this point including his boss and nelson is very aware that mm is violently insane and hungry for human flesh and bloodso the sheriff has his gun pointed at mm who is and i give the movie and rick baker props for this the most disgusting and terrifying object in human form that we have ever seen and he yells a very important question to doctor ted nelson what do we do now the camera cuts over to doctor ted nelson and it is obvious that ted has no idea what to do next apparently ted was so intent on the problem of finding the melting man he never thought to bring along some restraining devices a lasso or straitjacket or a net or some tranquilizer darts or maybe a new age tape by vangelis to soothe the savage beastso the sheriff panics and shoots the melting man goes berserk and hilarity ensues maybe this explains why nasa has been screwing around with the space shuttle program in sublunar space for the last thirty years instead of going back to the moon or out to mars like everyone knows they ought to be doing i do not knowanyway that is the kind of lousy lazy writing and direction that undercuts every aspect of this movie it is hard to say how good the actors actually are because the movie has complete contempt for their characterstwo other incredibly painful sequences also ramp up the stupidity of the proceedings there is a scene featuring the lumpiest old couple in the world trying to steal lemons from a grove only to be torn apart by the melting man this scene is a nadir in seventys cinema i can guarantee you have never watched a more pointless and irritating setup with odder looking people in your entire life and the melting mans assault on the lady who lives in the house where they keep a horse who pees on the walls defies every attempt to process itby the way i think famous film director jonathon demme has a walkon in this scene as the redneck husband who goes in first to check on the house and never comes out again the only thing that keeps the actress from literally chewing the scenery is that as i said their horse has apparently been peeing on it and we are forced to watch her hysterics for at least two minutes longer than any sane film director would hold the shot burr debenning ought to beat the crap out of imms director and photographer i remember him from an old columbo episode where he looked much better than he does here  no ones idea of a leading man but solid and unobtrusive but no one could possibly be as unappealing in real life as his director makes him look here everyone else comes off a little better except for the old couple and shut up i know they were being played for laughs but i are not laughing but not much this definitely falls into the so bad you cannot look away category of cinema disasters still i would watch it again before i would watch a lot of other seventys and eightys abortions  track of the moonbeast and it lives by night come to mind and msts coverage of it is great fun so if you get a chance watch the mst version,0
37,quite possibly how francis veber one of the best comedy directors in the world at least when sticking to his native france managed to turn in a film so completely unwatchable is beyond the reason of mere mortal man to discern it is not just that the characters are so unlikeable or that the film is so utterly devoid of even the lowest form of wit it is genuinely physically painful to watch such an endless parade of inept writing acting and filmmaking that you cannot believe this is the work of experienced  and talented  filmmakers for once the neareternity spent in the cutting room and on the shelf before its blinkandyou willmissit theatrical release tells the whole story what were they thinking,0
38,as someone who was staggered at the incredible visuals of hero i was anxious to see this film which was billed as being along the same lines but better it also featured an actress i like ziyi zhang well i was disappointed on both counts i bought the dvd of this film sightunseen and that was a mistake it was not betteri realize these flyingthroughtheair martial arts films are pure fantasy but this story is stretched so far past anything remotely believable it just made me shake my head in disappointing disbelief a blind woman defeating hundreds of opponents sorry that is going a little far also the major male character jin takeshi kaneshiro was so annoying with his dialog stupid look on his face and stupid laugh that he ruined the film toodespite the wonderful colors and amazing action scenes this story  to me  just did not have an appeal to make it a movie worth owning this film is no hero of mine,0
39,this movie was horrible simply put it was so bad i registered with imdb to warn you of its dangersi am a campy horror film expert per se i have watched redneck zombies house of the psychotic women slumber party massacre ii and many others i know my schlock and i know this movie sucksthree fourths of the film is comprised of scared individuals running from one side of the screen to the other when they are not running they are spouting nonsequitur lines devoid of emotion or motivation when the actors begin to be acceptable the direction falls to pieces there were so many jarring lowangle shots i figured leif jonker had a three foot tall tripod he used what i call the leif maneuver several millions times that is zooming out from an object of interest like an amateur apparently the film crew could not get up early enough to film a sunrise so they filmed a sunset and played it in reverse with direction this lazy you are actually impressed with the final gory scene the only thing you can figure is that the last five minutes was filmed before the first eightyfive minutesif you want a good bad gory movie rent rikioh or the foundational dead alive if you are a schlock buff and are looking for a challenge give darkness a goquote of the movievampire it is die time,0
40,this film failed to explore the humanity of the animals which left me with an empty feeling inside spoiler ahead i was not convinced that dr d really had a compelling reason to forego the big buyout deal to help his furry friends whereas babe the original bucked the trend of bigbudget hits by focusing on the human virtues of the animals vs their humans counterparts all the animals in this film were nothing more than comical caricatures which one would gladly stuff in the meatgrinder even more so if one could understand their pointless babble without eddie murphys zany behavior this film would be a flop,0
41,thhetwo is entertaining in that you will laugh a lot and cringe and probably say oh sht and get your face away from the goddamn hole you dumbs or things along those lines but i do not know if its really worth seeing i was very annoyed throughout the entirety with the horrible military characters who do not seem to know the first thing about combatyes there was more violence gore and a higher body count than the first one but i am still am debating whether that cancels out my feeling throughout the whole movie about how ridiculous it is and not a good ridiculousness like dead alive or feast my time would have been better spent watching ajas remake for the fiveth timeso go for some laughs or go for some gore but do not go hoping to come out of it satisfied,0

43,back in the days before the toxic avenger the lowcamp kings at troma films tried to take the high ok somewhatlesslow road of producing straight slasher pics i would like to think that viewing the results here is what convinced them to give up all pretension and go for selfconscious parodysplatter university is another film for the masochists in the audience as it meanders about through two separate casts and innumerable pointless subplots it actually becomes painful to watch let us see if i can summarizeafter learning that a dangerous psychopath has escaped from a local hospital the action moves to a catholic university i do not recall the name but in honor of the title let us call it st splatter the students are listless and sullen and argue pettily with each other slackers ahead of their time meanwhile the new professor julie parker proves utterly incompetent at her job the kids deal with relationships infidelity unwanted pregnancies lecherous priests and how to avoid doing any work in class julie deals with a creepy boyfriend the inflexible administration at st splatter counseling unwed mothers and the blank expressionless looks of her students none of it means a darn thing or gets resolved in any meaningful way oh and every once in a while a pov shot comes along and stabs one of the girls to death but do not hold your breath waiting for it there is a red herring killer and then a sadly anticlimactic confrontation with the real killer then it is back to the asylum and roll creditsthe slow pace and numerous inane subplots seem almost calculated to produce a mounting sense of frustration in the viewer which is helped along by choppy editing coffeecan sound quality and dialog that just does not make any sense and the most agonizing thing about this movie is the killers fixation on women  the men in this movie are just so deserving i would have paid good money to see someone off the jerk with the pregnant girlfriend or the lunkhead lothario who was fooling around with his girlfriends roommate or any of the creepy priests there are not no justice,0

45,frailtyeighttenit is nonsensical title and bill paxton directs headline aside this is a pretty good old fashioned rip snorting biblical horror thriller in the end it may end up only being the inbred southern gothic cousin of kubricks the shiningbut hey that is a pretty damn entertaining notion it is also got a doozy of a plot twistand a very ambiguous moral message this is the kind of movie that years from now people will catch late at night on basic cable and scare the beejesus out of themselves watching it too bad director bill paxton had to go hire himself to staroh wellstill a devil of a good rent,1
46,the sopranos is probably the most widely acclaimed tv series ever so naturally my expectations were through the roof and yet the show surpassed them i love the mafia and crime genre in film and i enjoy following the compelling stories set in these worlds but this is so much more eightysix hours of material gives the story a chance to not only be one of the most thrilling and unpredictable mafiaaction stories but also to be a great family drama a shocking character study a laughoutloud comedy a brilliant psychological examination dealing with the nature of good and evil and an intellectual arty collaboration of representative dreams and hallucinations all in one david chases epic series manages to accomplish all of this and more and cements hbo as the closest tv can get to cinematic perfection paving the road for a number of other series to continue blowing audiences awayrealism is present when it is needed but chases decisions to depart from it for effect on occasion for dream episodes and the like only adds more layers to the series chasealong with a strong writing staff including matthew weiner and terrence winter future creators of mad men and boardwalk empire respectivelyturns new jersey into an intricate universe full of the greatest cast of characters i have seen on tvjames gandolfini domineers the show as tony one of the most groundbreaking characters on tv ever tony adheres to half of the mobster stereotypes from pop culture but he defies the other half entirely and through his family interactions and his therapy sessions with dr melfi lorraine bracco with whom he has a considerable chemistry that ensures that the therapy scenes always have a completely different feel to the rest of the show we see nearly every side to tony soprano and learn that he is more of an everyman than one would expectedie falco matches the power of gandolfinis performance as tonys wife carmela from her mixed feelings about tonys lifestyle to her suspicions about murders to her torment over tonys cheating to her own thoughts about infidelity carmela runs the gamut of emotions throughout six seasons and falco makes her the prime vehicle for the non mafia viewers to have eyes into such a corrupt world scenes between tony and carmela provide some of the most heartwrenching and painfully realistic drama ever seen on televisionthe supporting cast is almost as phenomenal and a wide array of characters populate the cast over all six seasons somehow without any redundancies nancy marchand steals the show as tonys overbearing mother livia an insight into tonys personality problems and panic attacks the familiarity of marchands incessant complaints is almost gruesome since she takes the character so believably far michael imperioli is christopher tonys protégé whose various poor choices lead him down a road that is painful to watch but brilliantly executed drea de matteo plays christophers girlfriend adriana and is so well meaning and loving that the dark arc her character takes as she gets too involved with christophers career tony sirico is paulie introduced as the ultimate mafia stereotype and a source of comic but eventually he becomes one of the most sympathetic and complex characters on the show and nobody plays true anger better than he and that is just the tip of the icebergfamiliar faces such as peter bogdanovich jon favreau ben kingsley lauren bacall will arnett nancy sinatra david strathairn robert patrick hal holbrook burt young and eric mangini make appearances over the course of the show while names as notable as joe pantoliano steve buscemi and steven van zandt have regular roles as main characters in the series there are fifty great characters with powerful arcs and the excitement and tension never let up in any of the various subplots throughout the showcomedic elements and entire episodes filled with brilliant hilarity dilute the powerhouse dramatic intensity of the series which is so multipurpose that for one reason or enough the credits of nearly any episode left me somewhat bewildered the sopranos is the most powerful and addicting series i have seen overall and its highs are so mindblowing that i would have to call it my favourite show in spite of arguable lows most of which i disagree withwhether you love or hate the ending or what you make of it is irrelevant the discussion it has created is an achievement in itself the iconic nature of the entire series makes it an essential part of television history there are multiple elements for anyone to love and marvel at in this show so if you are thinking of watching something else instead do yourself a favour and fuhgeddaboutit,1

49,with no affinity towards any type of filmmaking and a healthy appreciation of documentaries i can honestly say i was angry at myself for bothering to sit through the entire length of twenty dates i will not waste your time with the plot you may read other reviews i will say though that berkowitzs hyper woody allenstyle narration was extremely annoying you either wished he would lay off the coffee or ingest some tranquilizers and it is potentially apparent to berkowitz himself that this film was a bad idea as parts of it details his trials to finance the documentary forgive me for disguising insults as compliments but i will give credit to berkowitz for having the skills to convince some idiot to finance this horrid piece of  i appreciate the boundaries  intentions of the film here but even when regarding the standards berkowitz sets for himself he fires off and misses on all levels in closing i am sure many of these female companions were not at ease going on a date with a twitchy want tobe filmmaker and therefore i question the films sense of authenticity hey myles i loved your film the first time i saw it when it appeared as an episode of seinfeld or was a film directed by woody allen or kevin smith,0
50,there is no relation all between fortier and but the fact that both are police series about violent crimes profiler looks crispy fortier looks classic profiler plots are quite simple fortiers plot are far more complicated fortier looks more prime suspect if we have spot similarities the main is weak and but have like to compare to judge to evaluate how about enjoying funny thing too people writing fortier looks american but the other hand arguing they prefer american series maybe it is the language or the spirit but i think this series is more english american by the way the are really good and funny the acting is not superficial at all,1
51,this movie is great the plot is very true the book which is a classic written by mark the movie with a scene where hank a song with a bunch of called when you stub your toe the moon it reminds me of sinatras song high hopes it is fun and the music is great throughout and my favorite song is sung by the king hank bing crosby and sir sagamore overall a great family movie or even a great date movie this is a movie you can watch over and over again the princess played by rhonda fleming is gorgeous i love this movie if you liked danny kaye in the court then you will definitely this movie,1
52,p cosmatos rambo blood wishfulfillment the united states clearly did not win the war vietnam they caused damage to country beyond the imaginable and this movie continues the fairy of the ohso innocent the only bad guys were the leaders of the who made this war happen the character of rambo is to notice this he is extremely bemoans usamericans did not appreciate and celebrate the of the soldier but nothing but distrust for leading officers and politicians like every film that defends the war eg we were soldiers also this one avoids the need to give a comprehensible reason for the engagement in south asia and for that matter also the reason for every single usamerican soldier that was there instead rambo gets to take revenge for the wounds of a whole nation it would have been better to work on how to deal with the memories rather than suppressing them do we get to win this time yes you do,0
53,in the process trying establish the empathy with jake roedel tobey maguire the the north and the jayhawkers missouri never withdrew from the and the union army was not an invading force the fought for rights the right to own slaves elect and and a political spoils system there is nothing noble in that the missourians could have easily traveled east and joined the confederate armyit seems to me that the story has nothing to do with ambiguity when jake leaves the bushwhackers it is not because he saw error in his way he certainly does not give himself over to the virtue of the because of abolition,1
54,yeh i know you are quivering well the secret lives of dentists not upset your expectations it solidly made but unimaginative truthful but dull it concerns the of a who happen to dentists and who share the same practice a recipe trouble if it not for our separate worklives we all ditch our spouses of sheer irritation whose mustache and demeanor do not everyman so much as flanders the is the mildmannered uberdad and hope is the boredstiff who her frustrations into amateur opera as dad the daughters attend one of davis performances he discovers his wife is her frustrations into more than just singing he witnesses his wife kissing and flirting with the director of opera one touch we never the operadirectors face dreading the prospect of instituting the proceedings for separation divorce and custody hearings only to the lawyers scott chooses to pretend ignorance of his indiscretionsalready the you are to yawn hohum another story about the pathetic sniveling cuckold but rudolph who took the story from a jane smiley novella hopes that the wellwornness of the material will be for by a of flashy postmodern touches for instance one of scotts belligerent denis leary kept relatively and blessedly check will later become a sort of construction of the dentists imagination emerging as a devilontheshoulder advocate for the oldfashioned masculine virtues dump the bh not eggedon by his buddy scott is otherwise tormented by fantasies that include his wife in a threeway with two of the male dentalassistants who in practice it is not going far to say that movie is eyes for real people or at least along lines campbell scott and hope davis are certainly recognizable human beings as to the glamourpuss of cruise and the script for secret lives is clearly more relevant than kubricks as proof i the depiction of the dentists children particularly the youngest one who is about three or years old and whose utterance is dad dad dad dad dad dad this is family life all with all its charmsthe movie would make interesting doublebill with kramer kramer as well one can easily the feminization of the american male from one thousand nine hundred and seventynine to two thousand and three in this movie dad is the housewife as in kramer but he is in no way flustered by the domestic role unlike dustin hoffman who was too manly to make toast here scott gets all the plumb chores such as wiping up the childrens vomit cooking cleaning taking the kids to whatever inane afterschool activity is on the docket and all without complaint and without directorial commentary it is just taken for grantedthe film has virtues mostly having to do with verisimilitude however it is dragged down from greatness by its insistence on trendy distractions which culminate in a long scene where a horrible fiveday stomach flu makes the rounds in the household we must endure pointless fantasy sequences initiated by the imaginary ringleader leary whose existence by the way is finally reminiscent of the brad pitt character in fight club and this finally drives home the films other big flaw lack of originality in this review i realize it is been far too easy to reference many other films granted this film is an improvement on most of them but still the secret lives of dentists is worth seeing but do not get too excited about it not that you were all that excited anyway i guess,0
55,while this movies style is not as understated and realistic as sound version probably would have been this is still a very good film in fact it was seen as an film in its day as it was nominated for the first best picture oscar losing wings i still consider wings to be a superior film but this one is excellent despite a little bit by the lead emil janningsjannings is a general from czarist russia who is out his final days making a few bucks in the one thousand nine hundred and twentys by being a hollywood extra his luck appears to have changed as he gets a casting callto play an russian general fighting against the during the revolution naturally this is not much of a stretch actingwise but it also gets the man to thinking about the old days and the revolutionexactly what happens next i will leave to you but it is a pretty good filmparticularly the end by the way for william powell as the russian despite being made in one thousand nine hundred and with the makeup he does not look much younger he did in many of his later,1
56,i give this movie seven out ten because the villains were interesting in their roles and the unknown batwoman creates an interesting guess who game the movie however needs more robin in it he appeared in the movie in the and sporadically throughout the rest i thought the new animated series did little justice the new robin let alone knightwing this movie continues that bad tradition the movie spends too much time bruce wayne and his romance which would not be so bad in one movie if the romance was not so unbelievable it is still good movie if you are a batman fan and i would recommend watching it,1
57,really awful actor did ok the plot completely crap and inaccurate it as well have a sequel to well anything it had or no relevance to carlitos way and should avoided like the plague by any carlitos ways no mention of gail he some other bird no mention of klienfelt no mention of how he got no mention of how he ended up in jail they attempted to make it like the original with flash backs at the beginning but to be honest rating it i was looking for a zero mark unfortunately i had to rate it higherits a terrible attempt to cash in on what was one of the best films of the ninetys overall it was approximately £six and two hours of my life wasted for all the action in it it was truly boring slow and predictable again to any carltios way fans avoid this fiasco,0
58,good i can not even begin to describe how poor do not me wrong i not expecting much to begin let us face it a pgthirteen slasher flick is predestined to missing the ummm slashing so no should be surprised by the lack of gore but it was the level of and cliché on all the other of this movie is what really blew me away we have a protagonist who is quite simply so completely useless you find yourself rooting the bad guy and here is a turnup for the never changes hence the cardinal rule of basic screen writing character if you by the of this film the poor girl is going to turn around and finally some arse then think again on top of this we are handed possibly the least intriguing and definitely the least scary killer ever to grace the genre i am not joking i say that dora the explorer scarier villains than this moviefinally because all the potential for tension or gratuity is removed by the inept and thirteenyearold director what possibly be left to two hours of screen time closets that is what lots and lots of closets big closets small closets mirrored closets closets to narnia so many damned closets you not want to dress yourself for another year in fact this movie should have just been called closet and had a picture of a big scary coathanger on the dvd case on the back it could have had a photograph of the audience falling asleep and a quote by roger and ebert something to the extent of what the f did we just waste our time watching,0
59,home room deals with columbinelike highschool shooting but rather hashing over the occurrence itself the film portrays the and what happened the survivors their trauma guilt and denialspoilers the shooting itself is treated as a foregone conclusion with no action footage other than the reaction an swat commando after shooting the high school killer the film has the detective the crime of which no guilty are left to and teenage girls surviving the incident played by a very young erika christensen and busy philippsthe two girls having nothing in common the shooting are put together because of it and the drama ensueserika christensen though only has been around the block so much that film viewers are pretty much with her solid and reliable style of busy philipps three older than christensen and altogether unknown to me blew me away with her overwhelming dramatic strength and screen presence this girl was the partit is a great movie and it to you with its intimate focus the yet growing relationship between the two traumatized girls gus elephant two thousand and three though good seems almost superficial and paltry compared to home room when it comes to dramatic and acting what i can see this film got very little screen time and exposure so much more a loss for an equally traumatized americaten out of ten,1
60,this begins wager between edgar allen poe and a journalistpoe bets that the man can not spend an entire night in a creepy castle well course he can but will he come out unscathed hard say with all these that are not supposed to be there wandering around including the icy barbara steele this is a fairly odd film in that the presentation is both in french and english and switches back and forth a few times perhaps this is done because bits of dialog were lost it is also rather dark and claustrophobic being that one does not see much beyond a small circle of light that and such generate plus there is a feel of dread and pretty much all times this version synapse is also uncensored and i wondered what might be in a film from one thousand nine hundred and sixtyfour until i saw the topless scene i guess that might be it overall this is pretty good and in gloomy black and white barbara steele definitely makes the movie too eight out of ten,1
61,weekend i bought zombie movie the bargain bin and watched it some friends it going to a budget of land of the deadboy was i wrong it as if they spent a good portion of budget on the coverart which very misleading to of the zombie genrewe watched to the point the zombie chicks come and the car with some yuppie who is out in the middle of nowhere talking business on a cellphone they actually speak to the guy before one of the girls kills him but once they started driving the car i could not suspend my disbelief anymoresome people actually consider this a so bad it is good movie they are liars i did not finish the movie but one of the other reviews mention that they actually somehow become police officers at the end of the movie which makes me glad to not have watched it all the way throughthis is even worse than zombiez do not watch,0
62,well the reason seeing it the cinema it was a sneak preview else i never have seen terrible teenage slasher movie i mean have not we had enough of this yet scream and scary movie at least did not take them serious the plot sucks and the the worst i have seen only can which is the only movie that competes in the worst i have seen in the cinema this onethere is so many plot holes in the and the girls are so alike that you do not even now who has been killed and who has not and you do not care the only of them i knew in advance was denise and she was the most talent less actress i have ever seen in this bad excuse for a moviestay as far away from this movie as possible twoten,0
63,we have average family dads a rapper we have the rebelious teenage daughter the adopted kid and the kid and we have careless housemaid what show had a housemaid like do we have a messedup brady bunch yay it i thought it really cool mostly because i was young the was bad the raps were so bad and they were grated all of his raps were about his family and friends and problems the dad was kind of the full house type of dad always gave the advice out but he was not a clean freak they had a housekeeper for that remember the plots were basically lil romeo was in trouble of some sort or not that is it oh and maybe some preteen drama yeah that stuff is good not really but its still a good show for kids but nikelodean could do better,0

65,i thought this was movie it touches fiber a being the love in the film is very intense i thought it was wills best performance date great directing liked the music was great good use of flashback this is the kind of movie everyone should see i hope will get something wonderful from this overall movie i think hollywood should make more movies with substance even action can have a caring story i the fact that will was very in his he had a purpose and a dedication that is rare to see i would suggest watching this alone or with someone that you really care about for me i found that the world stopped and my only focus was the film the outside world was suspended for a moment it was a nice feeling with all this chaos going on in this world and with this me generation it was great to see somethingsomeone that cared about other people more himself,1
66,why on earth colin firth pointless he really strapped cashthe film is not clear on what it wants to about exotic places ghosts a vehicle for mr darcy it is a muddled muddy messthere to be some sort of idea that must be good in itself and that italian has something to as a language but in the the girls just want to go back to yanklandthere are pointless on the beach in churches on roads but what it is all about or why anybody should care simply is not clearthere also a yank woman in the film it was not clear what here job was but she seemed only to be there to make vapid inappropriate and maudlin comments to the girl was it supposed to be about paedophilliaa pretty dreadful mess all in all i gave it two rather than one because it does not have the charm of an utterly ghastly film,0
67,back thousand hundred and eightyfive i thing i can not even call it a movie on cable i in college and i was a school friend whose were raging of control i figured out on this was stupid script a bunch of old guys some young guys to show them how to with women bad with one exception and pathetic jokes the plentiful female nudity here kept my friend happy a whilebut even he was bored thirty minutes in rememberthis was a high school boy this was back before nudity was so to get to by the internet and such we kept watching hoping for something interesting or funny but that never happened the funniest thing about this was the original ad campaign in which the studio admitted this film was crap one poster had a fictional review that said this is the best movie i have seen this afternoon only grant cramer in the lead showed any talent and has actually gone on to a career in the business nobudget and boring ta skip it,0
68,it is easy forget once later series had developed the alien conspiracy plot arc more that once upon time the xfiles wrote episodes genderbender and fearful symmetry where the aliens were not all little grey men or mindcontrol goop but could actually surprise youfearful symmetry with an invisible elephant actually an elephant dislocated in space and time not a mile away from the walk and ends with a pregnant gorilla being abducted and it is very much an episode moments the subplot is annoyingly worthy yeah we get it zoos are bad when they are not but the ideas that within it are fascinating powerful and very memorable and it covers an angle abduction that is largely overlooked why would humans be the only things that aliens are inin the end it was not an instant classic but it was enjoyable viewing while it lasted again very memorable and mainly it is something that you could not many other shows,1

70,i am usually not to say a not worth watching but is certainly extenuating circumstance the only true upside to this film is cornelia sharpe looking rather attractive and the that this film is really shortthe plot the film is unbelievably boring and goes nowhere throughout the film none of the characters are even interesting and there is no reason to care about anyone i am not sure why on earth connery agreed to do this film but he should have definitely passed on this onethe only reason i seeing this film is if you are a diehard sean connery and simply want to see everything he is save this one for last thoughwell if you by some miracle end up seeing this despite my review or any of the other reviews on this site then i hope you enjoy it more than i did thanks for reading,0
71,not funny how can anyone link to monty python absolutely ridiculous there are no laughs this is not funny over the top but ugly weird just weird sake and it to me these people were on something all the time unfortunately something that did not make them funnyit should given some points for effort whatever actually it appears there is a laugh track or is there hummm since there are barely any laughs that is a debatable questionmaybe i am it injustice maybe it is some sort of exercise some sort of art that case anything goes never mindbut these guys playing women highpitched voices turnedup noses come on not funny there is only one heir apparent to monty intellectual wit and that is colbert and maybe jon,0
72,okay i rented movie because of the directorhe made some interesting flicks the past if you have not seen waxork you are missing a fun ride anyway i had my about this movie the beginning but i decided to suck it and give it a look it bad very bad if you have not seen the movie and do not mind spoilers read ahead of all the old saying you can not judge a by it is cover applies here the box this flick to indicate is the stone fox long hair with highlights the back of the box has a cool shot of the redleather jill and some other shots the description you want to rent the movie because it sounds good you start watching it and suddenly you find that the movie takes place inexplicably in thousand hundred and seventyseven jill is a total dog who is not the girl on the cover the movie is not quite as predictable as you thinkand that is not a good thing characters do so many stupid things without any modicum of motivationit is embarrassing to watch minutes before the of the movie dolph and another lady have sex for no good reason what the point of having dolph kill this other lady in blood who had helping him anthony hickox the director should have seen a stinker he read the script had it been set in the underworld of the milennium and made the characters halfway intelligent it might have been decent to set it in the seventys makes no sense and has no on the whatsoever avoid it,0
73,this obscure de sica delivers the goods and it is the meek shall inherit the earth this tale classes the surface but really an for all the homeless that populated europe after the great war they are homeless but in too impoverished and selfish care for or them footmats for the italian de sica chooses to tell it as a fairy tale a cinderella story i have not read the book it is based on so i can not foresay if the deus ex machina is the construct of the writer or vittorio it begins with the words once upon a time to the of its tale for the story could be set anywhere and everywhere caricature of the that cut to the bone whimsical of the homeless especially when they to grant their wishes and an right out of a picture makes this boulange a for all de sicas most accessible picture is also one of his best abandoning he dallied between that and pure good old filmmaking he creates a movie that breaks the heart and at the same time fills it with the yearning of hope that one needs to continue leaving in this world gracias vittorio gracias gracias gracias,1
74,wes craven you are having a laugh at our expense the red eye plot preposterous we are confronted by a guy who spent weeks watching a girl who then turns at airport her flirts and chats her up successfully somehow a seat to her a two seat space not in the of a five seat contacts at checkin and is cheezily during a painfully slooooow build up then up in the air in a confined space surrounded by he immediately starts the vacuous if superefficient rachel mcadams and saying tosh like we got ya daddy do what i say or poppa gets it well forgive me but did not they have her daddy ready slaughtersoyoubetteroughta long before stepped on the plane and not it have oh sooooooo much simpler to simply snatch the gal off the street and terrorise her in a room somewhere forgetting the and insecure dad plot pulling her nails or whatever she made the all important call or even cos is the movies and we need a few unreal twists the dumb dadindistress thing intact if you must but dress it up better so holding him in way until the convoluted plot had been made some sense without the plane dumbdown alternatively without wanting to sound like an actual terroristassassin not the massive bazookamissile thang employed have been far more easily used on say a car driving down the highway the politician inside rather than the fiftyth of a miami seafront hotel a fishing boat mind you as we already know security in miami is lax so they speed away i know i know far more fun to go watching a pretty girl for eight weeks burgle her dads house to steal his wallet that somehow star trek style gets from miami to texas instantly in order to her to for a politician to change hotel room and and and well a thousand things could go wrong here entirely destroying the big plan so why not slim the down to a sensible handful such as one bazooka two car three boom my fifty minute drive from the cinema spent highlighting the abundance of flaws and stupid codhitchcockian twists which sadly was the best fun of the whole sorry and as for security back at miami airport we have an apparently crazy and girl running off a plane by cops who during the chase sits down to have a coffee moves elsewhere to read a at a bar then runs again like crazy up and down the whole terminal by now chased by crazed cillian no cctv then i had guns pulled on me for parking in the wrong place for seconds at miami airport a of years back so instead of speaking to the cops her allies or getting on the blower at a callbox direct to her dad to warn him his life is in danger mcadams instead to steal a people carrier off a family in the airport forecourt call the damned security and drives home to daddy mowing down the assassin with the vehicle in the front garden of the house in a rich neighbourhoodwatch district crushing the front porch in the process an act which actually wakes dad up from an afternoon snooze about a minute yet which somehow fails to register with neighbours who are not even mildly curious thus ensuring fifteen more minutes of hide and seek as the duo run around the vast hollodeck house dohhh it actually hurts to keep thinking about it all cillian surely silly un for this one preposterously turns from ice assassin to comically unhinged and inept lunatic killer at the this theoretically ruthless despatcher of human life now allowing the dad to live so that he can watch his daughter getting her goose cooked i would better stop because the stream of drivel i am writing here must sound as uncoordinated as the red eye script if ms mcadams had not been allowed to get on the plane in the place the title could have been altered from red eye to no eye dear rr,0
75,i love horses and hand drawn animation so i expected nothing short from dreamworks new animated picture spirit stallion of the cimarron i guess you could say i was little bit disappointed you have animation and first what seems a perfect story a story about absolutely nothing but a horse in the animals do not cute songs or even talk a major plus the film has an for narration by matt damon a sappy soundtrack by bryan adams and enough action scenes compare it to a jerry bruckheimer production if the film makers would have stayed with we would have a masterpiece here this is not a great film but it is good entertainment for small children i would recommend this film to families because it has its heart in the right place and its the only thing out there right now that is not offensive to small children not bad but could have been much better very pretty visuals though,1
76,the and only time i shades during a sneakpreview it had not even premiere i there was someone of the directors there do not even remember who it was a belgian movie we never heard of it so we were quite neutral not knowing what to expect mickey rourke a actor and he is stands miles ahead all the rest he actor who is star long rising he is helping to realise a movie in belgium entitled shadesas as the movie started we noticed how much swearing there is nothing the swear word however was way beyond annoying whenever rourke the f word to express something it comes naturally however someone from the cast a nonenglish speaker uses the f or s word it becomes arrogant and aggressivewe quickly lost count of how many times they used the f and s words everybody was just glad to be out of the theatre and we had to give a vote but it was hard for us because it was only from zero to ten and we were looking for the ten,0
77,i seriously love this film so much i never get sick watching it the only line i really can not stomach in this is when riff calls herself but other that everything else is perfect i have never been a fan of pj soles and it did not help hear that she did not even know who the ramones were until she this movie but i can ignore her little face for the most part most who watch this over and over are fans of the ramones and really that is the only reason i love it so much i never get tired of seeing deedee mess up his pizza lines or joey mess up the of the teacher over and over haha one of the best parts of the film is seeing them do you want to dance down the of the high school i love it the special edition dvd has a good retrospective surprisingly pj soles is not it maybe she was working on project laugh anyway great film even better if you are a ramones fan,1
78,this is the best scifi that i have seen in my watching scifi i also believe that dark angel will become cult favorite the action is great but jessica alba is the best and most gorgeous star on tv today,1
79,it is good see that vintage film buff have correctly categorized their dvd release as musical for that is what this film is pure and simple its unofficial remake the one thousand nine hundred and fortynine the murder plot is an excuse for an elaborate girlie show with kitty carlisle and gertrude michael leading a cast superdecorative girls including ann sheridan lucy ball beryl wallace gwenllian gill gladys young barbara fritchie wanda perry and dorothy white carl brisson is also hand to his strong to cocktails for undoubtedly the movies most popular song it is heard no four times however it is gertrude michael who steals the show not only with her rendition of sweet marijauna but her strong performance as the heros girlfriend as for the rest of the cast we could have done without jack oakie and victor mclaglen altogether the only good thing about oakies role is his weak running with cult icon toby in fact to give you an idea as to how far the rest of the comedy is and superdumb mclaglen simply can not put his hands on the killer even though would you believe in this it happens to be the person you most suspect mitch leisen actually goes to great to point the killer out to even the dumbest member of the cinema by giving the player concerned closeup after closeup,1
80,i just finished watching movie it not ridiculously bad but i am really disappointed it i am not really sure why someone make a movie like this it was marginally entertaining but i feel like the people making it had a of on what they were making monday the was charge tuesday the director wednesday the guy who gets the coffee it almost like they really wanted to make a movies but only had the time and to make onesomeone else commented the was really good but i would have to then again if the were able to a face during the filming they are better actors than i give them forthe back of the gives the impression that the movie would a mystery something along the lines of a historical law and order or national it starts off like that but then of nowhere it takes a turn a bad of the or what was that other show that was not as good a bad episode of the outer limitsmy complaint about the movie that it is just so out there is the evil guy with spiked white hair there is the love interest who when she first appears the wind actually blows through her hair seriously once you realize it is a christian movie the end is also pretty easy to spotthe cinematography was poorly done especially in the opening scenes way to put your best foot forward it was not atrocious for most of the movie but there was the occasional ridiculously bad shot of an old lady praying arms up in a dark room while lightening is striking the sort of thing that just makes you a little bit embarrassed to be watching the movie,0
81,slither a horror comedy does not really have enough horror or comedy to qualify as or the other it one that is exceptionally good any of zingers that but very few real scares and not enough to maintain the movie addition the script does not focus on the and heroine and goes off kilter in several placesa major failing of is that it introduces and then leaves its hero fillion to follow grant rooker as he is introduced and then becomes the monster this whole of the film drags michael rookers character is not that interesting to us as a person and watching as he goes a of motions in the monsters interest might interesting if this grant portrait of a man turning into a monster rather than a horrorcomedy alien invasion movie in the analysis this movies problems are in the script it is not that important to the how the monster or propagates the purpose of a horrorcomedy is to the heroes backed in a corner shotguns and then throw bugs at them with them cracking wise every time something frightening or disgusting happens instead we get exploration of the aliens habits and tactics that just this part of the movie drag the ostensible heroine elizabeth banks as starla grant is more central to this part but nonetheless i felt the movie had left its track unless it planned on grant grant all the way to the endwhen fillion and his finally confront the alien the movie does begin to cook but again the problem is in the script by this point that audience knows and the characters should know that grant is not just suffering some disease and act accordingly shotguns instead they continuously in the face of increasing evidence that this is not something that let us get you to a hospital is going to help although reactions might have human and real these are characters in an action movie and simply should have what the movie promised delivered action a lack of action in a movie with as few ideas as this is a great failing spoilers ahead the first and the bursting of the alien larval sack a character and the best scene in the movie the script once again betrays the movie at this point one of the characters is almost taken over by the alien and develops an into the alien the writerdirector gunn chooses as this character a completely character rather than one of developed minor characters why why did he need to introduce a completely new character more than an hour into the movie that becomes central to the plot by the time this character is attacked we know hardly anything about her and care less about her even though is a winsome teenage girl in her bath had gunn decided not to use this character and just used one of the established minor characters he could have completely avoided introducing her family and saved time and furthermore the hero and heroine have been in on the aliens plans without all the characters and could have gotten around to blowing away aliens sooner and with more vigormy criticism is on the movies look gunn is primarily a or maybe it was constraints but this movie looked ugly and uninteresting of the action takes place at in woods or on a and the screen simply looks drab the sets in wheelsy the fictional town the action takes place look cheap the whole movie looks cheap box office mojo states the budget was fifteen million newspapers say twentynine million and they did not use any name i would say the money did not show up on screen the monster is just repulsive and looks deadlythe last criticism is primarily based on the reality of the characters actions by the time fillion and have begun grantthe alien one woman has disappeared and grant is known to have been mutilating animals at this point i was expecting the fbi or at least the state police to show up and take over from the hick sheriff a woman has disappeared and likely been murdered and a has been acting psychotic time to call the but basically i was hoping that would happen because i just wanted some characters who would show up and actalthough this movie is ostensibly a horrorcomedy the movie it the most resemblance to is dreamcatcher in terms of monstrous invasion and the of monster and its intentions dreamcatcher had much bigger problems with especially the entire and particularly the ending in many ways it was stronger primarily because the characters were stronger but more because it looked beautiful although that be anathema preferring the movie that is weaker in general plot and structural spine because of production values that just you how uninteresting i the look of slither,0
82,gus sant has made some i truly fanhowever i can not help but feel that the edge tom robbins book even cowgirls get the blues is lost in translation the big screen alone tom robbins and gus van sant are incredible and towers of talent ultimately though this one did not work it was not that the were not well developed or the plot and content did not come alive it is just that our are much more powerful when reading a book this we are taken away to a different time and place and we think the worst andor the best and it to the overall rollercoaster of the book as it unfolds according to the authors precision movies however can leave one with less of the imagination and emotion rollercoaster detracting from the overall experience this is what i believe happened herei suggest reading the book,1
83,what appalling of rubbish who are all these people who blubber on about how good yes it is and yes it is foreign but is not enough the plot is boring and disjointed like a reality show but not so slickly madethe people are intrinsically uninteresting but as characters they do not have enough depth to feel empathy them if they are on real people then i feel very very sorry for themthe violence and some of it is very quite ostentatious and gratuitous it is like the producer visions of quenton tarantino not that i think very much of him eitherand oh yes if i had neighbours like these i would move,0
84,a b science fiction movie and the director made no bones about it it is about a dragon who is to life by a scientific team everything is stuff you have seen many before it is a weak script no real characters it is of stereotype characters and situations the director attacks this by just making it a formula movie with no attempt to fool us and gives this movie a mild appeal but it is not something you are likely to a it is best seen while you are cooking cleaning sort of mindless fun it its place in but it certainly is not something you sit down with friends to watch unless you are all just drunk and do not care the mass rating of threetwo is probably fair i do not it is as crappy as most people but i am surprised that some people in the postings thought this was spectacular that really eludes me as i see no attempt to even make this a memorable film,0
85,i was rawlins when this movie was made and i got lucky enough be able to work it both as an extra and with eddie surkin on special effects it was fun to see all the behind the scene from the barbedwire coming alive to the electric up through the wardens office floor also it was lot fun getting to meet all the from viggo to tiny also the gate that was cut into the prison wall for the movie was and still is called disney gate by if anybody is and is ever in rawlins most of the movies sets are still in place and can be seen during the self guided tour it was a lot of fun working for and with and wished i had a chance to do it again,1
86,i my favorite of movie the that the sheer pointless stupidity and of the proceedings comes at the climax of the doctor nelson and his unmarried friend the sheriff have finally the melting man on a landing on some stairs electrical generating plant in mind that nelson looking the mm for the entire film and that the mm has killed and eaten several people at this point his boss and nelson very aware that mm is violently insane and hungry for human flesh and bloodso the sheriff has his gun at mm who is and i give the movie and rick baker props for this the disgusting and terrifying object in human that we have ever seen and he a very important question to doctor ted nelson what do we do now the camera cuts over to doctor ted nelson and it is obvious that ted has no idea what to do ted so intent on the problem of finding the melting man he never thought to bring along some restraining a lasso or straitjacket or a net or some tranquilizer darts or maybe a tape by vangelis to soothe the savage beastso the sheriff panics and shoots the melting man goes berserk and ensues maybe this explains why nasa has been screwing around the space program in sublunar space for the thirty years instead of going back to the moon or to mars like everyone knows they ought to i do not knowanyway that is the kind of lousy lazy writing and direction that undercuts every aspect of this movie it is hard to say how good the actually are because the movie has complete contempt for characterstwo other incredibly painful sequences ramp the stupidity of the proceedings there is a featuring the lumpiest old in the trying to steal lemons a only to be torn by the melting man this scene is a nadir in seventys cinema i can guarantee you have never watched a more pointless and irritating setup with odder looking people in your entire life and the melting mans assault on the lady who lives in the house they keep a horse who pees on the defies every attempt to process itby the way i think film director jonathon demme has a walkon in this scene as the redneck who goes in to check on the house and never comes out again the only thing that keeps the actress from literally the scenery is that as i their horse has apparently been on it and we are forced to watch her hysterics for at least two minutes than any sane film director hold the shot burr debenning ought to the crap out of imms director and photographer i him from an old columbo where he looked much better than he does here no ones idea of a man but and unobtrusive but no one possibly be as unappealing in real life as his director him look here everyone else comes off a better except for the old couple and up i know they were being played for laughs but i are not laughing but not much this definitely falls into the so bad you can not look away category of cinema disasters still i would watch it again before i would watch a lot of other seventys and eightys abortions track of the moonbeast and it lives by night come to mind and msts coverage of it is great fun so if you get a chance watch the mst version,0
87,quite possibly how veber of the best comedy directors the at least sticking to his native managed to turn in a so completely unwatchable beyond the reason of man to discern it is not just the characters are so unlikeable or that the film is so utterly of even the lowest form of wit it is genuinely physically painful to watch such an endless parade of inept writing acting and filmmaking that you can not believe this is the work of experienced and talented filmmakers for once the neareternity spent in the cutting room and on the shelf before its blinkandyou willmissit theatrical release tells the whole story what were they thinking,0
88,as someone who staggered at the of i was anxious to which was billed as along the same lines but better it featured actress i like ziyi zhang well i was disappointed on counts i bought the of this film sightunseen and was a mistake it was not betteri realize these flyingthroughtheair martial arts are fantasy but this is stretched so far past anything remotely believable it just made me shake my head in disappointing disbelief a blind woman defeating hundreds of opponents sorry that is going a little far also the major male character jin takeshi kaneshiro was so annoying with his dialog stupid look on his face and stupid laugh that he ruined the film toodespite the wonderful colors and amazing action scenes this story to me just did not have an appeal to make it a movie worth owning this film is no hero of mine,0
89,movie horrible simply put it was so bad i registered imdb to warn you of its dangersi am a campy horror expert i have watched redneck zombies house of the psychotic women slumber party massacre and many i know my schlock and i know this movie sucksthree fourths of the film of individuals running of the screen to the other they are not running they are spouting nonsequitur lines of emotion or motivation when the begin to acceptable the direction falls to there were so many jarring lowangle shots i figured leif jonker had a three tall tripod he used what i call the leif several millions is zooming out from an object of interest like an amateur apparently the film crew could not get up early enough to film a sunrise so they filmed a sunset and played it in reverse with direction this lazy you are actually impressed with the final gory scene the only thing you can figure is that the last five minutes was filmed before the first eightyfive minutesif you want a good bad gory movie rent rikioh or the foundational dead alive if you are a schlock buff and are looking for a challenge give darkness a goquote of the movievampire it is die time,0
90,failed to explore the humanity of the animals which left me empty feeling inside spoiler ahead i not convinced d really had a compelling reason to forego the big buyout deal to help his furry friends babe the original bucked the trend of bigbudget by focusing on the human virtues of the animals their humans counterparts all the animals in this film were nothing more than comical caricatures which one would gladly stuff in the meatgrinder even more so if one could understand their pointless babble without eddie murphys zany behavior this film would be a flop,0
91,thhetwo entertaining you laugh a and cringe and probably say oh sht and your face away the goddamn hole you dumbs or things along lines but i do not know if its really worth seeing i very annoyed throughout the entirety the horrible military characters who do not seem to know the thing about combatyes there was more violence gore and a body count than the first but i am am debating whether that cancels out my feeling throughout the whole movie about how ridiculous it is and not a good ridiculousness like dead alive or feast my time would have been better spent watching ajas remake for the fiveth timeso go for some laughs or go for some gore but do not go hoping to come out of it satisfied,0

93,back the days before the toxic avenger the lowcamp kings at troma tried to take the ok somewhatlesslow of producing slasher pics i like to viewing the results here what convinced them to give all and go selfconscious parodysplatter university is another for the masochists in the as it meanders about two separate casts and innumerable pointless it actually becomes painful to watch let us if i can summarizeafter learning that a dangerous psychopath escaped a hospital the action moves to a catholic university i do not the name but in of the title let us call it st splatter the students are listless and sullen and argue other slackers ahead of time meanwhile the professor utterly incompetent at her job the kids deal with infidelity unwanted pregnancies priests and how to avoid any in class julie deals with a creepy boyfriend the inflexible administration at st splatter counseling unwed mothers and the blank expressionless looks of her students none of it means a darn thing or gets resolved in any meaningful way oh and every in a a pov shot comes along and stabs one of the girls to death but do not hold your breath waiting for it there is a red herring killer and then a sadly anticlimactic confrontation with the real killer then it is back to the asylum and roll creditsthe slow pace and numerous inane subplots seem almost calculated to produce a mounting sense of frustration in the viewer which is helped along by choppy editing coffeecan sound quality and dialog that just does not make any sense and the most agonizing thing about this movie is the killers fixation on women the men in this movie are just so deserving i would have paid good money to see someone off the jerk with the pregnant girlfriend or the lunkhead lothario who was fooling around with his girlfriends roommate or any of the creepy priests there are not no justice,0

99,no affinity any of filmmaking and a healthy appreciation of documentaries i can honestly say i at myself bothering to sit the entire length of twenty dates i not waste your time with the plot you read other reviews i will say though berkowitzs hyper woody allenstyle was extremely annoying you either wished he lay off the coffee or some tranquilizers and it potentially apparent to berkowitz himself that was a bad idea as parts of it details his trials to finance the forgive me for disguising insults as compliments but i will give to berkowitz for having the to convince some idiot to finance this horrid of i appreciate the boundaries intentions of the film here but even regarding the standards berkowitz sets for himself he fires off and misses on all levels in closing i am sure many of these female companions were not at ease going on a date with a twitchy want tobe filmmaker and therefore i question the films sense of authenticity hey myles i loved your film the first time i saw it when it appeared as an episode of seinfeld or was a film directed by woody allen or kevin smith,0
