there is no relation at all between fortier and profiler but the fact that both are police series about violent crimes profiler looks crispy fortier looks classic profiler plots are quite simple fortiers plot are far more complicated fortier looks more like prime suspect if we have to spot similarities the main character is weak and weirdo but have clairvoyance people like to compare to judge to evaluate how about just enjoying funny thing too people writing fortier looks american but on the other hand arguing they prefer american series  maybe it is the language or the spirit but i think this series is more english than american by the way the actors are really good and funny the acting is not superficial at all,1
this movie is a great the plot is very true to the book which is a classic written by mark twain the movie starts of with a scene where hank sings a song with a bunch of kids called when you stub your toe on the moon it reminds me of sinatras song high hopes it is fun and inspirational the music is great throughout and my favorite song is sung by the king hank bing crosby and sir saggy sagamore overall a great family movie or even a great date movie this is a movie you can watch over and over again the princess played by rhonda fleming is gorgeous i love this movie if you liked danny kaye in the court jester then you will definitely like this movie,1
george p cosmatos rambo first blood part ii is pure wishfulfillment the united states clearly did not win the war in vietnam they caused damage to this country beyond the imaginable and this movie continues the fairy story of the ohso innocent soldiers the only bad guys were the leaders of the nation who made this war happen the character of rambo is perfect to notice this he is extremely patriotic bemoans that usamericans did not appreciate and celebrate the achievements of the single soldier but has nothing but distrust for leading officers and politicians like every film that defends the war eg we were soldiers also this one avoids the need to give a comprehensible reason for the engagement in south asia and for that matter also the reason for every single usamerican soldier that was there instead rambo gets to take revenge for the wounds of a whole nation it would have been better to work on how to deal with the memories rather than suppressing them do we get to win this time yes you do,0
in the process of trying to establish the audiences empathy with jake roedel tobey maguire the filmmakers slander the north and the jayhawkers missouri never withdrew from the union and the union army was not an invading force the southerners fought for states rights the right to own slaves elect crooked legislatures and judges and employ a political spoils system there is nothing noble in that the missourians could have easily traveled east and joined the confederate armyit seems to me that the story has nothing to do with ambiguity when jake leaves the bushwhackers it is not because he saw error in his way he certainly does not give himself over to the virtue of the because of abolition,1
yeh i know  you are quivering with excitement well the secret lives of dentists will not upset your expectations it is solidly made but essentially unimaginative truthful but dull it concerns the story of a married couple who happen to be dentists and who share the same practice already a recipe for trouble if it was not for our separate worklives we would all ditch our spouses out of sheer irritation campbell scott whose mustache and demeanor do not recall everyman so much as ned flanders from the simpsons is the mildmannered uberdad husband and hope davis is the boredstiff housewife who channels her frustrations into amateur opera one night as dad  the daughters attend one of davis performances he discovers that his wife is channeling her frustrations into more than just singing he witnesses his wife kissing and flirting with the director of opera one nice touch we never see the operadirectors face dreading the prospect of instituting the proceedings for separation divorce and custody hearings  profitable only to the lawyers  scott chooses to pretend ignorance of his wifes indiscretionsalready the literate among you are starting to yawn hohum another story about the pathetic sniveling little cuckold but rudolph who took the story from a jane smiley novella hopes that the wellwornness of the material will be compensated for by a series of flashy postmodern touches for instance one of scotts belligerent patients denis leary kept relatively  and blessedly  in check will later become a sort of construction of the dentists imagination emerging as a devilontheshoulder advocate for the oldfashioned masculine virtues dump the bh etc when not eggedon by his imaginary new buddy scott is otherwise tormented by fantasies that include his wife engaged in a threeway with two of the male dentalassistants who work in their practice it is not going too far to say that this movie is eyes wide shut for real people or grownups at least along those lines campbell scott and hope davis are certainly recognizable human beings as compared to the glamourpuss pair of cruise and kidman further the script for secret lives is clearly more relevant than kubricks as proof i offer the depiction of the dentists children particularly the youngest one who is about three or four years old and whose main utterance is dad dad dad dad dad dad this is family life all right with all its charmsthe movie would make an interesting doublebill with kramer vs kramer as well one can easily trace the feminization of the american male from one thousand nine hundred and seventynine to two thousand and three in this movie dad is the housewife as in kramer but he is in no way flustered by the domestic role unlike dustin hoffman who was too manly to make toast here scott gets all the plumb chores such as wiping up the childrens vomit cooking cleaning taking the kids to whatever inane afterschool activity is on the docket and all without complaint and without directorial commentary it is just taken for grantedthe film has virtues mostly having to do with verisimilitude however it is dragged down from greatness by its insistence on trendy distractions which culminate in a long scene where a horrible fiveday stomach flu makes the rounds in the household we must endure pointless fantasy sequences initiated by the imaginary ringleader leary whose existence by the way is finally reminiscent of the brad pitt character in fight club and this finally drives home the films other big flaw lack of originality in this review i realize it is been far too easy to reference many other films granted this film is an improvement on most of them but still the secret lives of dentists is worth seeing but do not get too excited about it not that you were all that excited anyway i guess,0
while this movies style is not as understated and realistic as a sound version probably would have been this is still a very good film in fact it was seen as an excellent film in its day as it was nominated for the first best picture oscar losing to wings i still consider wings to be a superior film but this one is excellent despite a little bit of overacting by the lead emil janningsjannings is a general from czarist russia who is living out his final days making a few bucks in the one thousand nine hundred and twentys by being a hollywood extra his luck appears to have changed as he gets a casting callto play an imperial russian general fighting against the communists during the revolution naturally this is not much of a stretch actingwise but it also gets the old man to thinking about the old days and the revolutionexactly what happens next i will leave to you but it is a pretty good filmparticularly at the end by the way look for william powell as the russian director despite being made in one thousand nine hundred and twentyeight with the makeup he does not look much younger than he did in many of his later films,1
i give this movie seven out of ten because the villains were interesting in their roles and the unknown batwoman creates an interesting guess who game the movie however needs more robin in it he appeared in the movie in the beginning and sporadically throughout the rest i always thought the new animated series did little justice to the neat new robin character let alone knightwing this movie just continues that bad tradition the movie spends too much time on bruce wayne and his romance which would not be so bad in one movie if the romance was not so unbelievable it is still a good movie if you are a batman fan and i would recommend watching it,1
really awful lead actor did ok the film plot etc was completely crap and inaccurate it may as well have been a sequel to well anything it had little or no relevance to carlitos way and should be avoided like the plague by any carlitos ways fans no mention of gail in fact he ends up with some other bird no mention of klienfelt no mention of how he got caught no mention of how he ended up in jail they attempted to make it like the original with flash backs at the beginning but to be honest when rating it i was looking for a zero mark unfortunately i had to rate it higherits a terrible attempt to cash in on what was one of the best films of the ninetys overall it was approximately £six and two hours of my life wasted for all the action in it it was truly boring slow and predictable again to any carltios way fans avoid this fiasco,0
good grief i cannot even begin to describe how poor this film is do not get me wrong i was not expecting much to begin with let us face it a pgthirteen slasher flick is predestined to be missing the ummm slashing so no one should be surprised by the lack of gore but it was the level of incompetence and cliché on display in all the other aspects of this movie is what really blew me away we have a protagonist who is quite simply so completely useless that you find yourself rooting for the bad guy and here is a turnup for the books she never changes  hence breaking the cardinal rule of basic screen writing  character development if you think by the end of this film the poor little girl is going to turn around and finally kick some arse then think again on top of this we are handed possibly the least intriguing and definitely the least scary killer ever to grace the genre i am not joking when i say that dora the explorer has scarier villains than this moviefinally because all the potential for tension or gratuity is removed by the inept and apparently thirteenyearold director what could possibly be left to fill up two hours of screen time closets that is what lots and lots of closets big closets small closets mirrored closets closets to narnia so many damned closets you will not want to dress yourself for another year in fact this movie should have just been called closet and had a picture of a big scary coathanger on the dvd case on the back it could have had a photograph of the audience falling asleep and a quote by roger and ebert  something to the extent of what the f did we just waste our time watching,0
home room deals with a columbinelike highschool shooting but rather than hashing over the occurrence itself the film portrays the aftermath and what happened to the survivors their trauma guilt and denialspoilers the shooting itself is treated as a foregone conclusion with no action footage other than the reaction of an almost teenage swat commando after shooting the high school killer the film has three protagonists the detective investigating the crime of which no guilty parties are left to convict and two teenage girls surviving the incident played by a very young erika christensen and busy philippsthe two girls having nothing in common besides the shooting are put together because of it and the drama ensueserika christensen though only twentyfour has been around the block so much that film viewers are pretty much acquainted with her solid and reliable style of acting busy philipps three years older than christensen and altogether unknown to me blew me away with her overwhelming dramatic strength and screen presence this girl was the partit is a great movie and it connects to you with its intimate focus on the fragile yet growing relationship between the two traumatized girls gus van sants elephant two thousand and three though good seems almost superficial and paltry compared to home room when it comes to dramatic flair and acting what i can see this film got very little screen time and exposure  so much more a loss for an equally traumatized americaten out of ten,1
this begins a wager between edgar allen poe and a journalistpoe bets that the man can not spend an entire night in a creepy castle well of course he can but will he come out unscathed hard to say with all these strange people that are not supposed to be there wandering around including the icy barbara steele this is a fairly odd film in that the presentation is both in french and english and switches back and forth a few times perhaps this is done because bits of dialog were lost it is also rather dark and claustrophobic being that one does not see much beyond a small circle of light that candles and such generate plus there is a feel of dread and impending doom pretty much at all times this version on synapse is also uncensored and i wondered what might be censored in a film from one thousand nine hundred and sixtyfour until i saw the topless scene i guess that might be it overall this is pretty good and in gloomy black and white barbara steele definitely makes the movie too eight out of ten,1
last weekend i bought this zombie movie from the bargain bin and watched it with some friends thinking it was going to be a budget version of land of the deadboy was i wrong it seems as if they spent a good portion of their budget on the coverart which is very misleading to fans of the zombie genrewe watched up to the point where the zombie chicks come alive and get in the car with some yuppie who is out in the middle of nowhere talking business on a cellphone they actually speak to the guy before one of the girls kills him but once they started driving the car i could not suspend my disbelief anymoresome people actually consider this a so bad it is good movie they are liars i did not finish the movie but one of the other reviews mention that they actually somehow become police officers at the end of the movie which makes me glad to not have watched it all the way throughthis is even worse than zombiez do not watch,0
well the reason for seeing it in the cinema was that it was a sneak preview else i would never have seen this terrible teenage slasher movie i mean have not we had enough of this yet scream and scary movie at least did not take them self serious the plot sucks and the acting is the worst i have seen only godzilla can compare which is also the only movie that competes in being the worst i have seen in the cinema with this onethere is so many plot holes in the story and the girls are so alike that you do not even now who has been killed and who has not and you do not care the only of them i knew in advance was denise and she was the most talent less actress i have ever seen in this bad excuse for a moviestay as far away from this movie as possible twoten,0
we have an average family dads a famous rapper we have the rebelious teenage daughter the adopted white kid and the cute little kid and we have careless housemaid what show has had a housemaid like that do we have a messedup brady bunch yay when it first came out i thought it was really cool mostly because i was young the music was bad the raps were so bad and they were too grated all of his raps were about his family and friends and problems the dad was kind of the danny from full house type of dad always gave the advice out but he was not a clean freak they had a housekeeper for that remember the plots were basically lil romeo was in trouble of some sort or not that is it oh and maybe some preteen drama yeah that stuff is good not really but its still a good show for kids but nikelodean could do better,0
when my sister said this movie was going to be good i had second thoughts but i watched it and it was actually funny basically the movie is made of a weird girl who goes to a small town where no one likes her and she just wants to go there and get the reading of her aunts will don so she can go but its not all that easy in this movie you will come across hilarious humor a witch a book of spellsrecopies a mentally challenged uncle and a dog you will understand the meaning of the word freak a after anyways i hope you run right out and try to find this really old movie hope you like it in total i will have to give it a zero no i am totally joking ill give it a nine hope you understand that you will laugh you will scream and you may just be offendedlove yours truly dakota you can email me at dakotalovesithot mailcom if you want to,1
i thought this was a wonderful movie it touches every fiber of a human being the love in the film is very intense i thought it was wills best performance to date great directing liked the editing music was great good use of flashback this is the kind of movie everyone should go see i hope people will get something wonderful from this overall excellent movie i think hollywood should make more movies with substance even action films can have a caring story i like the fact that will was very subtle in his acting he had a purpose and a dedication that is rare to see i would suggest watching this alone or with someone that you really care about for me i found that the world stopped and my only focus was on the film the outside world was suspended for a moment it was a nice feeling with all this chaos going on in this world and with this me generation it was great to see somethingsomeone that cared about other people more than himself,1
why on earth is colin firth in this pointless film has he really been that strapped for cashthe film is not clear on what it wants to be about grief exotic places ghosts a vehicle for mr darcy it is a muddled muddy messthere seems to be some sort of idea that italy must be good in itself and that italian has something to offer as a language  but in the end the girls just want to go back to yanklandthere are pointless episodes on the beach in churches on busy roads  but what it is all about or why anybody should care simply is not clearthere was also a yank woman in the film it was not clear what here job was but she seemed only to be there to make vapid inappropriate and maudlin comments to the girl was it supposed to be about paedophilliaa pretty dreadful mess all in all i gave it two rather than one because it does not have the charm of an utterly ghastly film,0
back in one thousand nine hundred and eightyfive i caught this thing i cannot even call it a movie on cable i was in college and i was with a high school friend whose hormones were raging out of control i figured out early on that this was hopeless stupid script a bunch of old guys hiring some young guys to show them how to score with women bad acting with one exception and pathetic jokes the plentiful female nudity here kept my friend happy for a whilebut even he was bored after thirty minutes in rememberthis was a high school boy this was back before nudity was so easy to get to by the internet and such we kept watching hoping for something interesting or funny but that never happened the funniest thing about this was the original ad campaign in which the studio admitted this film was crap one poster had a fictional review that said this is the best movie i have seen this afternoon only grant cramer in the lead showed any talent and has actually gone on to a career in the business nobudget and boring ta skip it,0
it is easy to forget once later series had developed the alien conspiracy plot arc more that once upon a time the xfiles wrote episodes like genderbender and fearful symmetry where the aliens were not all little grey men or mindcontrol goop but could actually surprise youfearful symmetry starts with an invisible elephant  actually an elephant somehow dislocated in space and time not a mile away from the walk  and ends with a pregnant gorilla being abducted and it is very much an episode of wonderful moments the subplot is annoyingly worthy  yeah we get it zoos are bad except when they are not  but the ideas that within it are fascinating visually powerful and very memorable and it covers an angle on abduction that is largely overlooked  why would humans be the only things that aliens are interested inin the end it was not an instant classic but it was enjoyable viewing while it lasted again very memorable and mainly it is something that you could not imagine many other shows doing,1

i am usually not one to say that a film is not worth watching but this is certainly an extenuating circumstance the only true upside to this film is cornelia sharpe looking rather attractive and the fact that this film is really shortthe plot in the film is unbelievably boring and goes virtually nowhere throughout the film none of the characters are even remotely interesting and there is no reason to care about anyone i am not sure why on earth sean connery agreed to do this film but he should have definitely passed on this onethe only reason i could see for seeing this film is if you are a diehard sean connery fan and simply want to see everything he is done save this one for last thoughwell if you by some miracle end up seeing this despite my review or any of the other reviews on this site then i hope you enjoy it more than i did thanks for reading,0
not funny  how can anyone link this to monty python that is absolutely ridiculous  there are no laughs this is not funny over the top but ugly weird just for weird sake and it seems to me these people were on something all the time unfortunately something that did not make them funnyit should be given some points for effort etc whatever actually it appears there is a laugh track  or is there one hummm since there are barely any laughs that is a debatable questionmaybe i am doing it injustice  maybe it is some sort of exercise some sort of art  in that case anything goes never mindbut these guys playing women with highpitched voices turnedup noses come on  not funny there is only one heir apparent to monty pythons intellectual wit and that is stephen colbert and maybe jon stewart,0
okay i rented this movie because of the directorhe has made some interesting flicks in the past if you have not seen waxork you are missing a fun ride anyway i had my doubts about this movie from the beginning but i decided to suck it up and give it a look it is bad very bad if you have not seen the movie and do not mind spoilers read ahead first of all the old saying you cannot judge a book by it is cover applies here the box for this flick seems to indicate that jill is the stone fox with long hair with highlights the back of the box has a cool shot of the redleather jill and some other shots the description makes you want to rent the movie because it sounds good you start watching it and suddenly you find out that the movie takes place inexplicably in one thousand nine hundred and seventyseven jill is a total dog who is not the girl on the cover the movie is not quite as predictable as you would thinkand that is not a good thing characters do so many stupid things without any modicum of motivationit is embarrassing to watch ten minutes before the end of the movie dolph and another lady have sex for no good reason also what was the point of having dolph kill this other lady in cold blood who had been helping him anthony hickox the director should have seen a stinker when he read the script had it been set in the underworld of the new milennium and made the characters halfway intelligent it might have been decent to set it in the seventys makes no sense and has no bearing on the story whatsoever avoid it,0
this obscure de sica delivers the goods and it is said the meek shall inherit the earth this tale of classes on the surface but really an allegory for all the homeless people that populated europe after the great war they are homeless but cheerful in a societies too impoverished and selfish to care for or acknowledge them footmats for the italian carpetbaggers de sica chooses to tell it as a fairy tale a cinderella story i have not read the book it is based on so i cannot foresay if the deus ex machina is the construct of the writer or vittorio it begins with the words once upon a time to exemplify the timelessness of its tale for the story could be set anywhere and everywhere caricature sketches of the aristocracy that cut to the bone whimsical nature of the homeless especially when they begin to grant their wishes and an ending right out of a spielberg picture makes this boulange a delight for all de sicas most accessible picture is also one of his best abandoning neorealism he always dallied between that and pure good old filmmaking he creates a movie that breaks the heart and at the same time fills it with the yearning of hope that one needs to continue leaving in this world gracias vittorio gracias gracias gracias,1
wes craven you are having a laugh at our expense the red eye plot is preposterous we are confronted by a guy who has apparently spent eight weeks watching a girl who then turns up at an airport behind her flirts and chats her up successfully somehow wangles a seat next to her in a two seat space not trapped in the middle of a five seat row contacts at checkin and is cheezily nice during a painfully slooooow build up then once up in the air in a confined space surrounded by strangers he immediately starts threatening the vacuous if superefficient rachel mcadams and saying tosh like we got ya daddy do what i say or poppa gets it well forgive me but did not they already have her daddy ready for slaughtersoyoubetteroughta long before she stepped on the plane and therefore would not it have been oh sooooooo much simpler to simply snatch the gal off the street and terrorise her in a room somewhere forgetting the complicated and insecure dad plot pulling her nails out or whatever until she made the all important call required or even  cos this is the movies and we need a few unreal twists  keep the dumb dadindistress thing intact if you must but dress it up better so that holding him in harms way until the convoluted plot had been concluded made some sense without the plane dumbdown alternatively without wanting to sound like an actual thinking terroristassassin  could not the massive bazookamissile thang employed have been far more easily used on say a car driving down the highway with the politician inside rather than the fiftyth story of a miami seafront hotel from a fishing boat mind you as we already know security in miami is lax so they will speed away i know i know far more fun to go through watching a pretty girl for eight weeks burgle her dads house to steal his wallet that somehow  star trek style  gets transported from miami to texas instantly in order to  perhaps  get her to arrange for a politician to change hotel room and and and well a thousand things could go wrong here each one entirely destroying the big plan so why not slim the elements down to a sensible handful such as  one bazooka two car three boom my fifty minute drive home from the cinema was spent highlighting the abundance of flaws and stupid codhitchcockian twists which sadly was the best fun of the whole sorry experience and as for security back at miami airport we have an apparently crazy and violent girl running off a plane chased by cops who during the chase sits down to have a coffee moves elsewhere to read a magazine at a bar then runs again like crazy up and down the whole terminal by now also chased by crazed cillian murphy no cctv then  i had guns pulled on me for parking in the wrong place for ten seconds at miami airport a couple of years back so instead of speaking to the cops  her allies  or getting on the blower at a callbox direct to her dad to warn him his life is in danger mcadams prefers instead to steal a people carrier off a family in the airport forecourt call the damned security and drives home to daddy mowing down the assassin with the vehicle in the front garden of the house in a rich neighbourhoodwatch district crushing the front porch in the process  an act which actually slightly wakes dad up from an afternoon snooze after about a minute yet which somehow fails to register with neighbours who are not even mildly curious thus ensuring fifteen more minutes of hide and seek shenanigans as the duo run around the vast hollodeck type house dohhh it actually hurts to keep thinking about it all  cillian surely renamed silly un for doing this one preposterously turns from ice assassin to comically unhinged and inept lunatic killer at the end this theoretically ruthless despatcher of human life now allowing the dad to live so that he can watch his daughter getting her goose cooked i would better stop because the stream of drivel i am writing here must sound as uncoordinated as the red eye script if ms mcadams had not been allowed to get on the plane in the first place the title could have been altered from red eye to no eye dear rr,0
i love horses and admire hand drawn animation so i expected nothing short of amazement from dreamworks new animated picture spirit stallion of the cimarron i guess you could say i was a little bit disappointed you have wonderful animation and at first what seems like a perfect story a story about absolutely nothing but a horse in nature the animals do not sing cute songs or even talk  a major plus sadly the film has an uncalled for narration by matt damon a sappy soundtrack by bryan adams and enough action scenes to compare it to a jerry bruckheimer production if the film makers would have just stayed with simplicity we would have a masterpiece here this is not a great film but it is good entertainment for small children i would recommend this film to families because it has its heart in the right place and its the only thing out there right now that is not offensive to small children not bad but could have been much better very pretty visuals though,1
the first and only time i saw shades was during a sneakpreview it had not even been in premiere i remember there was someone of the directors staff there do not even remember who it was a belgian movie we never heard of it so we were quite neutral not knowing what to expect mickey rourke is a brilliant actor and he is stands miles ahead all the rest he plays an actor who is star has long stopped rising he is helping to realise a movie in belgium entitled shadesas soon as the movie started we noticed how much swearing there is nothing against the occasional swear word however this was way beyond annoying whenever rourke uses the f word to express something it comes naturally however when someone from the cast a nonenglish speaker uses the f or s word it becomes arrogant and aggressivewe quickly lost count of how many times they used the f and s words everybody was just glad to be out of the theatre and we had to give a vote but it was hard for us because it was only from zero to ten and we were looking for the ten,0
i seriously love this film so much i never get sick of watching it the only line i really cannot stomach in this is when riff calls herself a teenage lobotomy but other than that everything else is perfect i have never been a fan of pj soles and it did not help to hear that she did not even know who the ramones were until she filmed this movie but i can ignore her snarly little face for the most part most people who watch this over and over are fans of the ramones and really that is the only reason i love it so much i never get tired of seeing deedee mess up his pizza lines or joey mess up the name of the teacher over and over haha one of the best parts of the film is seeing them sing do you want to dance  down the halls of the high school i love it the special edition dvd has a good retrospective surprisingly pj soles is not on it maybe she was working on another project laugh anyway great film even better if you are a ramones fan,1
this is the best scifi that i have seen in my twentynine years of watching scifi i also believe that dark angel will become a cult favorite the action is great but jessica alba is the best and most gorgeous star on tv today,1
it is good to see that vintage film buff have correctly categorized their excellent dvd release as a musical for that is what this film is pure and simple like its unofficial remake murder at the windmill one thousand nine hundred and fortynine the murder plot is just an excuse for an elaborate girlie show with kitty carlisle and gertrude michael leading a cast of superdecorative girls including ann sheridan lucy ball beryl wallace gwenllian gill gladys young barbara fritchie wanda perry and dorothy white carl brisson is also on hand to lend his strong voice to cocktails for two undoubtedly the movies most popular song it is heard no less than four times however it is gertrude michael who steals the show not only with her rendition of sweet marijauna but her strong performance as the heros rejected girlfriend as for the rest of the cast we could have done without jack oakie and victor mclaglen altogether the only good thing about oakies role is his weak running gag with cult icon toby wing in fact to give you an idea as to how far the rest of the comedy is overindulged and overstrained superdumb inspector mclaglen simply cannot put his hands on the killer even though would you believe in this instance it happens to be the person you most suspect director mitch leisen actually goes to great pains to point the killer out to even the dumbest member of the cinema audience by giving the player concerned closeup after closeup,1
i just finished watching this movie it was not ridiculously bad but i am really disappointed with it i am not really sure why someone would make a movie like this it was marginally entertaining but i feel like the people making it had a lot of disagreements on what they were making monday the writer was in charge tuesday the director wednesday the guy who gets the coffee etc it almost seems like they really wanted to make a couple different movies but only had the time and money to make onesomeone else commented that the acting was really good but i would have to disagree then again if the actors were able to keep a straight face during the filming perhaps they are better actors than i give them credit forthe back of the dvd gives the impression that the movie would be a mystery something along the lines of a historical law and order or national treasure it starts off like that but then out of nowhere it takes a turn towards a bad episode of the twilight zone or what was that other show that was not as good a bad episode of the outer limitsmy main complaint about the movie is that it is just so played out there is the evil guy with spiked white hair there is the love interest who when she first appears the wind actually blows through her hair seriously once you realize it is a christian movie the end is also pretty easy to spotthe cinematography was poorly done especially in the opening scenes  way to put your best foot forward it was not atrocious for most of the movie but there was the occasional ridiculously bad shot of an old lady praying arms up in a dark room while lightening is striking  the sort of thing that just makes you a little bit embarrassed to be watching the movie,0
slither is a horror comedy that does not really have enough horror or comedy to qualify as one or the other it has one scene that is exceptionally good any number of zingers that work but very few real scares and not enough humor to maintain the movie in addition the script does not focus on the hero and heroine and goes off kilter in several placesa major failing of this film is that it introduces and then leaves its hero fillion to follow grant grant michael rooker as he is first introduced and then becomes the monster this whole part of the film drags  michael rookers character is not that interesting to us as a person and watching as he goes through a series of motions while acting in the monsters interest might be interesting if this was grant  portrait of a man turning into a monster rather than a horrorcomedy alien invasion movie in the final analysis this movies problems are in the script  it is not that important to the audience how the monster acts or propagates the purpose of a horrorcomedy is to get the heroes backed up in a corner with shotguns and then throw bugs at them with them cracking wise every time something frightening or disgusting happens instead we get an exploration of the aliens habits and tactics that just makes this part of the movie drag the ostensible heroine elizabeth banks as starla grant is more central to this part but nonetheless i felt the movie had left its narrative track unless it planned on following grant grant all the way to the endwhen fillion and his posse finally confront the alien the movie does begin to cook but once again the problem is in the script by this point that audience knows  and the characters should know  that grant is not just suffering from some disease and act accordingly shotguns  instead they continuously parley in the face of increasing evidence that this is not something that let us get you to a hospital is going to help although their reactions might have been human and real these are characters in an action movie and simply should have done what the movie promised  delivered action a lack of action scenes in a movie with as few ideas as this is a great failing spoilers ahead  after the first confrontation and the bursting of the alien larval sack a minor character and perhaps the best scene in the movie the script once again betrays the movie at this point one of the characters is almost taken over by the alien and develops an insight into the alien the writerdirector gunn chooses as this character a completely new character rather than one of already developed minor characters why why did he need to introduce a completely new character more than an hour into the movie that becomes central to the plot by the time this character is attacked we know hardly anything about her and could care less about her even though she is a winsome teenage girl in her bath had gunn decided not to use this character and just used one of the established minor characters he could have completely avoided introducing her family and saved time and money furthermore the hero and heroine would have been filled in on the aliens plans without all the additional characters and could have gotten around to blowing away aliens sooner and with more vigormy last criticism is based on the movies look gunn is primarily a writer or maybe it was budgetary constraints but this movie looked ugly and uninteresting most of the action takes place at night in woods or on a field and the screen simply looks drab the sets in wheelsy the fictional town where the action takes place look cheap the whole movie looks cheap box office mojo states the films budget was fifteen million newspapers say twentynine million and considering they did not use any name talent i would say the money did not show up on screen the monster is just repulsive and rarely looks deadlythe last criticism is primarily based on the reality of the characters actions by the time fillion and co have begun hunting grantthe alien one woman has disappeared and grant is known to have been mutilating animals at this point i was expecting the fbi or at least the state police to show up and take over from the hick sheriff a woman has disappeared and likely been murdered and a local has been acting psychotic time to call the authorities but basically i was hoping that would happen because i just wanted some characters who would show up and actalthough this movie is ostensibly a horrorcomedy the movie it bears the most resemblance to is dreamcatcher in terms of monstrous invasion and the type of monster and its intentions whereas dreamcatcher had much bigger problems with story especially the entire morgan freeman subplot and particularly the ending in many ways it was stronger primarily because the main characters were stronger but more importantly because it looked beautiful although that may be anathema  preferring the movie that is weaker in general plot and structural spine because of production values  that just shows you how uninteresting i found the look of slither,0
gus van sant has made some excellent films i truly am a fanhowever i cannot help but feel that the cerebral edge of tom robbins book even cowgirls get the blues is lost in translation to the big screen alone tom robbins and gus van sant are incredible visionaries and towers of talent ultimately though this one just did not work it was not that the characters were not well developed or the plot and content did not come alive it is just that our imaginations are much more powerful when reading a book like this we are taken away to a different time and place and we sometimes think the worst andor the best and it adds to the overall rollercoaster of the book as it neatly unfolds according to the authors precision movies however can leave one with less of the imagination and emotion rollercoaster detracting from the overall experience this is what i believe happened herei suggest reading the book,1
what an appalling piece of rubbish who are all these people who blubber on about how good this is yes it is arty and yes it is foreign but  that is not enough the plot is boring and disjointed like a reality show but not so slickly madethe people are intrinsically uninteresting but as characters they do not have enough depth to feel empathy for them if they are based on real people then i feel very very sorry for themthe violence and some of it is very violent seems quite ostentatious and gratuitous it is like the producer has visions of being quenton tarantino not that i think very much of him eitherand oh yes if i had neighbours like these i would move,0
this is a formula b science fiction movie and the director made no bones about it it is about a dragon who is restored to life by a scientific team everything done is stuff you have seen many times before it is a weak script with no real characters in fact it is full of stereotype characters and situations the director attacks this by just making it a formula movie with no attempt to fool us and that gives this movie a mild appeal but it is not something you are likely to remember a while it is best seen while you are cooking cleaning working out sort of mindless fun it has its place in entertainment but it certainly is not something you sit down with friends to watch unless you are all just drunk and do not care the mass rating of threetwo is probably fair i do not think it is as crappy as most people but i am surprised that some people in the postings thought this was spectacular that really eludes me as i see no attempt to even make this a memorable film,0
i was living rawlins when this movie was made and i got lucky enough to be able to work on it both as an extra and with eddie surkin on special effects it was fun to see all the behind the scene workings from the barbedwire coming alive to the electric chair up through the wardens office floor also it was a lot of fun getting to meet all the actors from viggo to tiny also the gate that was cut into the prison wall for the movie was and still is called disney gate by locals if anybody is interested and is ever in rawlins most of the movies sets are still in place and can be seen during the self guided tour it was a lot of fun working for and with r harlin and wished i had a chance to do it again,1
i think that my favorite part of this movie the one that exemplifies the sheer pointless stupidity and inanity of the proceedings comes at the climax of the film doctor ted nelson and his unmarried friend the sheriff have finally cornered the melting man on a landing on some stairs in an electrical generating plant keep in mind that nelson has been looking for the mm for nearly the entire film and that the mm has killed and eaten several people at this point including his boss and nelson is very aware that mm is violently insane and hungry for human flesh and bloodso the sheriff has his gun pointed at mm who is and i give the movie and rick baker props for this the most disgusting and terrifying object in human form that we have ever seen and he yells a very important question to doctor ted nelson what do we do now the camera cuts over to doctor ted nelson and it is obvious that ted has no idea what to do next apparently ted was so intent on the problem of finding the melting man he never thought to bring along some restraining devices a lasso or straitjacket or a net or some tranquilizer darts or maybe a new age tape by vangelis to soothe the savage beastso the sheriff panics and shoots the melting man goes berserk and hilarity ensues maybe this explains why nasa has been screwing around with the space shuttle program in sublunar space for the last thirty years instead of going back to the moon or out to mars like everyone knows they ought to be doing i do not knowanyway that is the kind of lousy lazy writing and direction that undercuts every aspect of this movie it is hard to say how good the actors actually are because the movie has complete contempt for their characterstwo other incredibly painful sequences also ramp up the stupidity of the proceedings there is a scene featuring the lumpiest old couple in the world trying to steal lemons from a grove only to be torn apart by the melting man this scene is a nadir in seventys cinema i can guarantee you have never watched a more pointless and irritating setup with odder looking people in your entire life and the melting mans assault on the lady who lives in the house where they keep a horse who pees on the walls defies every attempt to process itby the way i think famous film director jonathon demme has a walkon in this scene as the redneck husband who goes in first to check on the house and never comes out again the only thing that keeps the actress from literally chewing the scenery is that as i said their horse has apparently been peeing on it and we are forced to watch her hysterics for at least two minutes longer than any sane film director would hold the shot burr debenning ought to beat the crap out of imms director and photographer i remember him from an old columbo episode where he looked much better than he does here  no ones idea of a leading man but solid and unobtrusive but no one could possibly be as unappealing in real life as his director makes him look here everyone else comes off a little better except for the old couple and shut up i know they were being played for laughs but i are not laughing but not much this definitely falls into the so bad you cannot look away category of cinema disasters still i would watch it again before i would watch a lot of other seventys and eightys abortions  track of the moonbeast and it lives by night come to mind and msts coverage of it is great fun so if you get a chance watch the mst version,0
quite possibly how francis veber one of the best comedy directors in the world at least when sticking to his native france managed to turn in a film so completely unwatchable is beyond the reason of mere mortal man to discern it is not just that the characters are so unlikeable or that the film is so utterly devoid of even the lowest form of wit it is genuinely physically painful to watch such an endless parade of inept writing acting and filmmaking that you cannot believe this is the work of experienced  and talented  filmmakers for once the neareternity spent in the cutting room and on the shelf before its blinkandyou willmissit theatrical release tells the whole story what were they thinking,0
as someone who was staggered at the incredible visuals of hero i was anxious to see this film which was billed as being along the same lines but better it also featured an actress i like ziyi zhang well i was disappointed on both counts i bought the dvd of this film sightunseen and that was a mistake it was not betteri realize these flyingthroughtheair martial arts films are pure fantasy but this story is stretched so far past anything remotely believable it just made me shake my head in disappointing disbelief a blind woman defeating hundreds of opponents sorry that is going a little far also the major male character jin takeshi kaneshiro was so annoying with his dialog stupid look on his face and stupid laugh that he ruined the film toodespite the wonderful colors and amazing action scenes this story  to me  just did not have an appeal to make it a movie worth owning this film is no hero of mine,0
this movie was horrible simply put it was so bad i registered with imdb to warn you of its dangersi am a campy horror film expert per se i have watched redneck zombies house of the psychotic women slumber party massacre ii and many others i know my schlock and i know this movie sucksthree fourths of the film is comprised of scared individuals running from one side of the screen to the other when they are not running they are spouting nonsequitur lines devoid of emotion or motivation when the actors begin to be acceptable the direction falls to pieces there were so many jarring lowangle shots i figured leif jonker had a three foot tall tripod he used what i call the leif maneuver several millions times that is zooming out from an object of interest like an amateur apparently the film crew could not get up early enough to film a sunrise so they filmed a sunset and played it in reverse with direction this lazy you are actually impressed with the final gory scene the only thing you can figure is that the last five minutes was filmed before the first eightyfive minutesif you want a good bad gory movie rent rikioh or the foundational dead alive if you are a schlock buff and are looking for a challenge give darkness a goquote of the movievampire it is die time,0
this film failed to explore the humanity of the animals which left me with an empty feeling inside spoiler ahead i was not convinced that dr d really had a compelling reason to forego the big buyout deal to help his furry friends whereas babe the original bucked the trend of bigbudget hits by focusing on the human virtues of the animals vs their humans counterparts all the animals in this film were nothing more than comical caricatures which one would gladly stuff in the meatgrinder even more so if one could understand their pointless babble without eddie murphys zany behavior this film would be a flop,0
thhetwo is entertaining in that you will laugh a lot and cringe and probably say oh sht and get your face away from the goddamn hole you dumbs or things along those lines but i do not know if its really worth seeing i was very annoyed throughout the entirety with the horrible military characters who do not seem to know the first thing about combatyes there was more violence gore and a higher body count than the first one but i am still am debating whether that cancels out my feeling throughout the whole movie about how ridiculous it is and not a good ridiculousness like dead alive or feast my time would have been better spent watching ajas remake for the fiveth timeso go for some laughs or go for some gore but do not go hoping to come out of it satisfied,0

back in the days before the toxic avenger the lowcamp kings at troma films tried to take the high ok somewhatlesslow road of producing straight slasher pics i would like to think that viewing the results here is what convinced them to give up all pretension and go for selfconscious parodysplatter university is another film for the masochists in the audience as it meanders about through two separate casts and innumerable pointless subplots it actually becomes painful to watch let us see if i can summarizeafter learning that a dangerous psychopath has escaped from a local hospital the action moves to a catholic university i do not recall the name but in honor of the title let us call it st splatter the students are listless and sullen and argue pettily with each other slackers ahead of their time meanwhile the new professor julie parker proves utterly incompetent at her job the kids deal with relationships infidelity unwanted pregnancies lecherous priests and how to avoid doing any work in class julie deals with a creepy boyfriend the inflexible administration at st splatter counseling unwed mothers and the blank expressionless looks of her students none of it means a darn thing or gets resolved in any meaningful way oh and every once in a while a pov shot comes along and stabs one of the girls to death but do not hold your breath waiting for it there is a red herring killer and then a sadly anticlimactic confrontation with the real killer then it is back to the asylum and roll creditsthe slow pace and numerous inane subplots seem almost calculated to produce a mounting sense of frustration in the viewer which is helped along by choppy editing coffeecan sound quality and dialog that just does not make any sense and the most agonizing thing about this movie is the killers fixation on women  the men in this movie are just so deserving i would have paid good money to see someone off the jerk with the pregnant girlfriend or the lunkhead lothario who was fooling around with his girlfriends roommate or any of the creepy priests there are not no justice,0

frailtyeighttenit is nonsensical title and bill paxton directs headline aside this is a pretty good old fashioned rip snorting biblical horror thriller in the end it may end up only being the inbred southern gothic cousin of kubricks the shiningbut hey that is a pretty damn entertaining notion it is also got a doozy of a plot twistand a very ambiguous moral message this is the kind of movie that years from now people will catch late at night on basic cable and scare the beejesus out of themselves watching it too bad director bill paxton had to go hire himself to staroh wellstill a devil of a good rent,1
the sopranos is probably the most widely acclaimed tv series ever so naturally my expectations were through the roof and yet the show surpassed them i love the mafia and crime genre in film and i enjoy following the compelling stories set in these worlds but this is so much more eightysix hours of material gives the story a chance to not only be one of the most thrilling and unpredictable mafiaaction stories but also to be a great family drama a shocking character study a laughoutloud comedy a brilliant psychological examination dealing with the nature of good and evil and an intellectual arty collaboration of representative dreams and hallucinations all in one david chases epic series manages to accomplish all of this and more and cements hbo as the closest tv can get to cinematic perfection paving the road for a number of other series to continue blowing audiences awayrealism is present when it is needed but chases decisions to depart from it for effect on occasion for dream episodes and the like only adds more layers to the series chasealong with a strong writing staff including matthew weiner and terrence winter future creators of mad men and boardwalk empire respectivelyturns new jersey into an intricate universe full of the greatest cast of characters i have seen on tvjames gandolfini domineers the show as tony one of the most groundbreaking characters on tv ever tony adheres to half of the mobster stereotypes from pop culture but he defies the other half entirely and through his family interactions and his therapy sessions with dr melfi lorraine bracco with whom he has a considerable chemistry that ensures that the therapy scenes always have a completely different feel to the rest of the show we see nearly every side to tony soprano and learn that he is more of an everyman than one would expectedie falco matches the power of gandolfinis performance as tonys wife carmela from her mixed feelings about tonys lifestyle to her suspicions about murders to her torment over tonys cheating to her own thoughts about infidelity carmela runs the gamut of emotions throughout six seasons and falco makes her the prime vehicle for the non mafia viewers to have eyes into such a corrupt world scenes between tony and carmela provide some of the most heartwrenching and painfully realistic drama ever seen on televisionthe supporting cast is almost as phenomenal and a wide array of characters populate the cast over all six seasons somehow without any redundancies nancy marchand steals the show as tonys overbearing mother livia an insight into tonys personality problems and panic attacks the familiarity of marchands incessant complaints is almost gruesome since she takes the character so believably far michael imperioli is christopher tonys protégé whose various poor choices lead him down a road that is painful to watch but brilliantly executed drea de matteo plays christophers girlfriend adriana and is so well meaning and loving that the dark arc her character takes as she gets too involved with christophers career tony sirico is paulie introduced as the ultimate mafia stereotype and a source of comic but eventually he becomes one of the most sympathetic and complex characters on the show and nobody plays true anger better than he and that is just the tip of the icebergfamiliar faces such as peter bogdanovich jon favreau ben kingsley lauren bacall will arnett nancy sinatra david strathairn robert patrick hal holbrook burt young and eric mangini make appearances over the course of the show while names as notable as joe pantoliano steve buscemi and steven van zandt have regular roles as main characters in the series there are fifty great characters with powerful arcs and the excitement and tension never let up in any of the various subplots throughout the showcomedic elements and entire episodes filled with brilliant hilarity dilute the powerhouse dramatic intensity of the series which is so multipurpose that for one reason or enough the credits of nearly any episode left me somewhat bewildered the sopranos is the most powerful and addicting series i have seen overall and its highs are so mindblowing that i would have to call it my favourite show in spite of arguable lows most of which i disagree withwhether you love or hate the ending or what you make of it is irrelevant the discussion it has created is an achievement in itself the iconic nature of the entire series makes it an essential part of television history there are multiple elements for anyone to love and marvel at in this show so if you are thinking of watching something else instead do yourself a favour and fuhgeddaboutit,1

with no affinity towards any type of filmmaking and a healthy appreciation of documentaries i can honestly say i was angry at myself for bothering to sit through the entire length of twenty dates i will not waste your time with the plot you may read other reviews i will say though that berkowitzs hyper woody allenstyle narration was extremely annoying you either wished he would lay off the coffee or ingest some tranquilizers and it is potentially apparent to berkowitz himself that this film was a bad idea as parts of it details his trials to finance the documentary forgive me for disguising insults as compliments but i will give credit to berkowitz for having the skills to convince some idiot to finance this horrid piece of  i appreciate the boundaries  intentions of the film here but even when regarding the standards berkowitz sets for himself he fires off and misses on all levels in closing i am sure many of these female companions were not at ease going on a date with a twitchy want tobe filmmaker and therefore i question the films sense of authenticity hey myles i loved your film the first time i saw it when it appeared as an episode of seinfeld or was a film directed by woody allen or kevin smith,0
when i was a kid i totally loved both bill  ted movies the other night bogus journey was on and since it was at least five years since i last saw it i decided to tune in and i loved it all over again this film is still funny after all those years excellent adventure is better but this one rocks just the same sure some of the perfomances are a bit cheesy but hey this entire film is cheesy in a cool way plus it features the coolest personation of death ever in a movie concluding totally like non bogus movie dude way excellent station,1
cry freedom is an excellent primer for those wanting an overview of apartheids cruelty in just a couple of hours famed director richard attenborough gandhi is certainly no stranger to the genre and the collaboration of the reallife mr and mrs woods the main white characters in their book and in this film lends further authenticity to cry freedom the video now in release actually runs a little over two and a half hours since twentythree minutes of extra footage was inserted to make it a two part tv miniseries after the films initial theatrical release while the added length serves to heighten the films forgivable flaws uneven character development and blanket stereotyping in particular another possible flaw the insistence on the white characters fate over that of the african ones may work out as a strength viewing crying freedom as a politically and historically educational film as i think it should over its artistic merits the story is one which black africans know only too well though the younger generation may now need to see it on film for full impact it is the whites who have always been the films and the books target audience hopefully driving them to change now twelve years after the movies production cry freedom is in many ways a more interesting film to watch almost ten years after black majority rule has been at least theorically in place one thousand nine hundred and eightysevens cry freedoms ideals remain by and large unrealized it therefore remains as imperative as ever for white south africans particularly the younger ones who have only heard of these actions to see it and absorb the films messages in total contrast to american slavery and the jewish holocausts exposure south africans struggles have been told by a mere two or three stories cry freedom cry the beloved country ok count it twice if you include the remake and sarafina did i miss one all three dramas also clumsily feature american and british actors in both the white and black roles not one south african actor has played a major role white coloured indian or black and yes i did miss another international south african drama mandela and deklerk though this also highly recommended biopic was released after black majority rule was instituted mandela was played by a black american sidney poitier who also starred in the original sathemed cry the beloved country while the afrikaner deklerk was played by a bald very british michael caine a good performance if you can dismiss that the very essence of afrikanerdom is vehement antibritish feelings until local sabc tv and african films start dealing with their own legacy cry freedom is about as authentic as you will get as villified as the whites particularly the afrikaners are portrayed in the film any observant noncasual visitor to south africa even now in one thousand nine hundred and ninetynine not to mention one thousand nine hundred and seventyseven when cry freedom takes place will generally find whites attitudes towards blacks restrained even understated looking at cry freedom in hindsight it is amazing that reconciliation can take place at all and it is but cry freedom at time shows not much has really changed in many peoples minds yet and that the black africans goal to freedom and reconciliation is still ongoing this is why if you are a novice to the situation cry freedom is your best introduction,1
this movie is like real life by which i mean  not a lot happens in the available two hours or so and not much game plan or plot is evidenced by the frequently invisible cast their invisibility being due to the experimental lighting as mentioned by many reviewers a big bore no big surprise that altman helms this  he is a very variable performer yes we all loved gosford park but pret a porter anyone kansas city dr t and the women aaargh but the fact that the raw material is a john grisham tale and the excellent cast that you will perceive through the gathering gloaming of your insistent slumber  makes this truly a masterpiece of bad film and no it is not so bad it is goodit is just bad,0
i have seen miracles still happen now at least four times i never tire of this fantastic movie from the very beginning it holds a persons interest as the movie progresses and the plane crashes the story becomes very intense as we watch this young girl trying to survive alone and frightened in the amazon following a plane crash in which she was the only survivor losing her mother in this plane crash as well makes this movie even more dramatic as we see the perils this young girl had to endure during her ten days in the amazon to think this really did happen is just unreal and to think that anyone could actualy survive this is unspeakable as we see the wild animals snakes and other reptiles the enormous forests and wildlife as well as countless insects as the movie progresses we see the many dangers this girl has to face as she tries to follow the river in hopes of it leading her to a town remembering what her father told her about how a stream will always lead to a river and then into an even larger river and this means it will eventually lead to a community this young girl keep track of the tiny stream which eventually lead into a huge river all throughout the movie at times having to swim in dangerous waters alone frightened injured she always managed to keep going towards the end of this movie it was obvious she would not have been able to continue much longer as she had not eaten in ten days and only had water to drink and was very sick and tired from her perils eventually as she sees a canoe she realizes there has to be a village and men find her and they take care of her and then take her to a hospital where her father comes to see her after fearing she was dead along with the many other passengers such a dramatic movie and so heartwarming to see her fathers face when he sees his daughter is actually still alive after all this time in the amazon movies like this are not made much those days i will still see it again and i know i will never tire of it to think this girl was the only one single survivor of this airplane is just unspeakable also the fact she only maintained a few very slight injuries was even more remarkable whereas everyone else on this airplane perished in the horrific crash into the wilds of the amazon a brilliant movie superbly acted out indeed and one i will treasure forever and love to continue watching strongly recommended by me for sure,1
i am not sure if it is available worldwide  but if anyone who is deciding what is supposed to be put on videotapes and distributed in video clubs  is reading this  please  please buy it if i was not clear get the movie into videostorescannot be explained  must see,1
a year or so ago i was watching the tv news when a story was broadcast about a zombie movie being filmed in my area since then i have paid particular attention to this movie called fido as it finished production and began playing at festivals two weeks ago fido began playing in my local theater and just yesterday i read a newspaper article which stated fido is not attracting audiences in it is limited release with the exception of our local theater in fact here it is outdrawing all other shows at the paramount theater including three hundred of course this makes sense as many locals want to see their city on screen or spot themselves roaming around in zombie makeup and for any other locals who have not seen fido yet but are considering it i can say there are many images on screen from the school to city park to the forbidden zone that you will recognize in fact they make the okanagan valley look beautiful that is right beautiful scenery in a zombie movie however fido itself is a very good movie yes despite its flaws it is better then most of the twenty other movies playing in my local market fido is best described as an episode of lassie in which the collie has been replaced by a member of the undead this is a clever premise and the movie even goes further by taking advantage of the one thousand nine hundred and fiftys emphasize on conformity and playing up the coldwar paranoia which led to mccarthyism furthermore it builds on the notion that zombies can be tamed or trained which george romero first introduced in day of the deadksun ray plays a small town boy who is mother carrieann moss longs for a zombie servant so she can be like all the other house wives on her block however his dad dylan baker is against the idea as he once had to kill his own zombie father eventually the family does acquire a zombie named fido played by billy connolly and adjusts to life with the undead billy connolly was inspired casting he is able to convey fidos confusion longing hatred and loyalty through only his eyes lumbering body and grunts connolly shows that he can play understated characters better than his outrageously comedic ones this is his best role since mrs brownfido follows in the footsteps of other recent zomcoms such as shawn of the dead and zombie honeymoon being someone who appreciates bruce campbell and misty mundae movies more than eli roth and jigsaw ones i prefer humor over gore in my horror however i understand the criticism of those horror fans who feel there is not enough undead carnage in fido yet i am sure patient viewers will be rewarded by the films gentle humorthe movie does break down in it is third act it is as if the writers were so wrapped up in the cute premise of domesticated zombies in the one thousand nine hundred and fiftys they forgot about the story arc however given my interest in horror comedies and my appreciation for seeing the neighborhood on screen i rate fido nine out of ten,1
i caught this at a test screening all i can say is whatthehell this movie plays out about as smoothly as mickey mouse reading the script for scarface it is bizarre beyond making the slightest bit of sense and even if you do leave your brain in the car the film is still so bizarre that it is not even funnythe plot involves crocodile hunter steve irwin trying to save a crocodile which contains a cia probe the cia comes after irwin to get their probe back irwin mistakes them for poachers and sets out to stop themthat is about all the story there is the rest is overthetop lampooning of australian culture didja see dat and crikey and strangely choreographed action sequences at one point irwin mounts a speeding rv and knife fights with a cia agent on top of it yes that is right steve irwin knife fights a guy on top of an rv let that be your guide for this ridiculously bad film,0
in my opinion this is a pretty good celebrity skit show i enjoyed seeing greg kinnear as the host there are many reasons why i said that even though hal sparks was an okay host i sometimes wish that greg kinnear had not left if you ask me it seems that nobody stays with a tv show throughout its entire run anymore still i enjoyed seeing the various hosts and other people spoofing celebrities if you ask me that was pretty darn funny before i wrap this up i must say that i kind of miss this show now in conclusion i highly recommend this show to all you diehard sketch show fans you will really enjoy it,1
my abiding love of italian actress lucianna paluzzi who helped jumpstart my puberty with her performance in one thousand nine hundred and sixtyfives thunderball has led me to some fairly unusual places case in point this british curiosity from one thousand nine hundred and fiftynine carltonbrowne of the fo which features lucianna in one of her earlier roles she plays a princess in this one although the picture is actually a showcase for the talents of terrythomas and peter sellers both of whose stars were certainly on the rise at this point in this cute often very funny film we learn of the madeiralike island nation of gaillardia which had been a british colony until one thousand nine hundred and sixteen and then universally forgotten fortythree years later however it becomes the center of worldwide attention and international espionage when valuable cobalt deposits are discovered there and her majesty sends the bumbling carltonbrowne of the foreign office to take charge terrythomas underplays this part nicely as does sellers in his role as prime minister amphibulos of the tiny country this was sellers second film of one thousand nine hundred and fiftynine concerning a tiny country matching wits with the world the other being the mouse that roared of course ian bannen almost steals the show here as gaillardias suave king and my girl lucianna is as appealing as can be in her minor role the film exhibits much in the way of very dry humor although there are some belly laughs to be had the reception at the gaillardian airport for example and especially that may daystyle parade of gaillardian strength and sellers seedy prime minister with his cracked english and seemingly perpetual sweat stains is yet another memorable character in this great actors pantheon despite the occasional instance or two of indecipherable stiffupperlip british gibberish i found this picture to be a winningly modest entertainment and well presented on this crisplooking anchor bay dvd,1
what is good about it some inventive and genuinely creepy little effects that will get under the skin of even the most seasoned horror fan does not rely on the hackneyed soundtrack stabs for its gotcha moments even if you have seen everything there is still a few things in this film that will make your jaw dropwhat could have been better about it the acting was at times flat and unconvincing it had a shotonvideo quality in some places thoughit mostly achieved the atmosphere it was striving for and the camera work is full of needless closeups of meaningless actions though the effects are genuinely creepy i think they may have gone to the well a few too many times with some of them the ending seemed rushed and glossed over what could have been more impactful moments the viewer is left to figure out a lot of things for themselves not as a challenge by the filmmakers but because they just missed itstill a good little indie horror film that is easily several steps above the average well worth the rental,1
bloodsuckers has the potential to be a somewhat decent movie the concept of military types tracking down and battling vampires in space is one with some potential in the cheesier realm of things even the idea of the universe being full of various different breeds of vampire all with different attributes many of which the characters have yet to find out about is kind of cool as well as to how most of the life in the galaxy outside of earth is vampire i am not sure how the makers meant for that to work given the nature of vampires who the hell they are meant to be feeding on if almost everyone is a vampire i do not know as it is the movie comes across a low budget mix of fireflyserenity and vampires movies with a dash of aliensthe action parts of the movie are pretty average and derivative particularly of serenity but passable they are reasonably well executed and there is enough gore for a vampire flick including some of the comical bloodspurting variety there is a lot of character stuff most of which is tedious coming from conflicts between characters who mostly seem like whiny immature arseholes primarily cowboy dude and asian woman there are a few character scenes that actually kind of work and the actors do not play it too badly but it mostly slows things down a nice try at fleshing the characters out but people do not watch a movie called bloodsuckers for character development and drama the acting is actually okay michael ironside hams it up and is as fun to watch as ever and at least of a couple of the women are hot the space sfx are not too bad for what is clearly a low budget work the story is again pretty average and derivative but as i said the world created has a little bit of potential the way things are set up bloodsuckers really does seem like the pilot for a tv series character dynamics introduced the world introduced but not explored etc the film does have a some highlights and head scratching moments the kind of stuff that actually makes these dodgy productions watchable the scene where our heroes interrogate a talking sock puppet chestburster type creature hilarious  the sex scene wtf indeed the credit and michael ironside as muco the most annoying aspect of it all though is the really awful and usually inappropriate pop music they have playing very loud over half the scenes of the movie it is painful to listen to and only detracts from what is only average at bestbasically an okay watch is you are up for something cheesy even if it is just for the chestburster scene,0
movies have put me to sleep before but no movie has ever done that twice so it took me three sittings actually to finish it the dialog was bad women spoke stiltedly and the men were caricatures and two of the supposedly japanese women looked chinese had chinese names and spoke with clearly chinese accents i am still trying to figure out why the emmenthal men were sexually wrapped up with each other ten minus eight onetwo equals a tough choice do i give this movie a rating of one or twomovies have put me to sleep before but no movie has ever done that twice so it took me three sittings actually to finish it the dialog was bad women spoke stiltedly and the men were caricatures and two of the supposedly japanese women looked chinese had chinese names and spoke with clearly chinese accents i am still trying to figure out why the emmenthal men were sexually wrapped up with each other ten minus eight onetwo equals a tough choice do i give this movie a rating of one or two,0
it is obviously illegal pedophiles pray on stuff like this how did they get away with making such a movie this movie is all summed up in one word sick where do people get off making and watching these kinds of films as i was watching the movie i did not actually think they would allow this kid that is say maybe twelve if that actually sleep with this woman sorry if this is a spoiler to you but i would have rater not seen this where has the sanity of these people gone maybe the makers of this movie are pedophiles our society today is filled with all types of sexual predators that pray upon children yet film makers make these types of movies that do nothing but provoke this type of behavior i noticed that on a previous comment someone asked if there was a version where it showed them naked this is a kid here and someone is asking something like this what is wrong with this picture,0
i am a huge fan of the comic book series but this movie fell way below my expectations i expected a heavy metal two thousand kind of feel to itslow moving bad dialogue lots of bloodbut this was worse than anything i could have imagined the plot line is almost the same as the comic but the good points pretty much stop there the characters do not have the energy or spirit that drew my attention in the comic series the movie only covers a small portion of the comic and the portion used is more slow and boring than later parts the focus in the movie is on the insignificant events instead of the more interesting overall plot of the comic bookwith the right people working on this project it could have been amazing sadly it was not that way so now there is yet another terrible movie that few will see and even fewer will love my copy will surely collect dust for years until i finally throw it out,0
if you like gangster type of movies then this is the first one you should buy or at least rent al pacino his performance is top notch and the story is classic ten  ten  why is not this movie in the top two hundred and fifty list,1
while the threed animation the highlight of the show did it is job well most other elements fell flat it was as though the filmmakers thought well it is going to be threed so we do not have to work that hard on the plot or character development and the fact that it is a childrens movie is absolutely no excuse the public is drawn to three dimensional characters shrek nemos dad just as much as they are drawn to three dimensional graphics the only dimension any of the main characters showed was two dimensional scooter who twists the plot from time to time with his compulsion to eat everything in sightand the absolute kicker buzz aldrins appearance at the very end after watching a very robotic cartoon version of the same historical figure for an hour and half comes on the screen and ruins everyone is good time by calling the films main characters contaminants and announcing that the situation put forth on screen was actually an impossibility did you just want to tell the kids the easter bunny and santa claus do not exist while you are at it,0
ariauna albright is a really good actress but why she participated in this lame written travesty is a mystery what could have been entertaining winds up as classic boredom the unique thing about ariauna is that she can act as well as look real sexy as opposed to her partner lilith stabs who looks fine but it is obvious she spent the money for acting school at the spa or beautician this was a production that cried out for some t  a  with a imaginative script writer could have achieved it in the flow of things however ariauna does what she can under the circumstances  to a extent salvages her reputation the tempe company should be aware that when you dress two attractive women in skimpy fetish cop uniforms the viewers will expect some fetish play  t  a nough said,0
it is a strange thing to see a film where some scenes work rather weakly if only in comparison to other films in its legacy and others in a subplot or supporting story are surprisingly provocative and strong sudden impact is one of those cases where clint eastwood as starproducerdirector shows when he can be at his best or at his lessor of times when dealing with a crimemysterydetective story in his dirty harry fame we get that make my day line and unlike in the first film where his do i feel lucky speech was playful and cool the first time and the second time at the end tough as nails here it is switched around he gets into another shamble with the department as usual when he tries to fight crime his way in particular with a diner robbery inspiration for pulp fiction and with a high speed pursuit with a senior citizen bus he is told to take a vacation and that is the last thing on his mind this whole main plot is not very convincing aside from the expectancy of the story and lines which just adds to the frustration but soon his story merges with the subplot that eastwood develops from the startenter sandra lockes character jennifer spencer whom we soon learn after some appropriately mysterious scenes that she and her shy sister were victims of a cruel unjust sexual assault err outright rape and is sleekly undercoverlike getting revenge her scenes and story are the strongest parts of the film the most intense and finally when it goes into callahans storyline he is getting facts in the same small town she is in on a murder the film finally finds a focus between eastwoods classic form of clearly defined good vs evil though sometimes blurred to be sure eastwood films the flashbacks not to say too much about them expertly in a fresh experimental style the trademark lalo schifrin score is totally atmospheric in these scenes and in others it almost seems like a couple of times an arthouse sensibility has crept into eastwoods firmly straightforward storytelling style which helps make the film watchableit is a shame though that in the end it goes more for the expectable or maybe not expectable points and until the third act callahan does not have much to do except his usual it is smithwessonand me shtick however with locke he gets out of her a very good performance more subtle and touching than the one in the gauntlet and an exciting climax at an amusement park in a way i do and do not agree with eberts remark that it is like a music video in eastwoods style here i admit there is comparisons with the simplicity of both the directness but the scenes where eastwood does break form are superior to those of any music video it is cheesy it is hardedged it is not up to par with the first two harry pictures but hey there could be worse ways to spend a couple hours with the master of the fortyfour,1
the sunshine boys was the hilarious one thousand nine hundred and seventyfive screen adaptation of neil simons play about a retired vaudevillian team played by walter matthau and george burns who had a very bitter breakup and have been asked to reunite one more time for a television special or something like that the problem is that the two still hate each other and want nothing to do with each other richard benjamin appears as matthaus nephew a theatrical agent who has been given the monumental responsibility of making this reunion a reality this warm and winning comedy is a lovely valentine to a forgotten form of entertainmentvaudeville and it works mainly thanks to one of neil simons better screenplays and outstanding work by matthau burns and benjamin burns won the best supporting actor oscar for this but i think matthau walks away with this film with his flawlessly hilarious performance as willy clark matthau was nominated for best actor but did not stand a chance against nicholson for one flew over the cuckoos nest however in another year this was an oscarworthy performance matthau commands the screen and there is not a false note in this beautifully timed performance the scene where he is auditioning for a potato chip commercial and cannot get the name of the product right is a classic the sunshine boys is a warm and winning neil simon comedy which shines thanks to unbeatable chemistry between matthau and burns,1
this is a review of the wizard not to be confused with the wiz or mr wizard the wizard is a lateeighties film about a seriously silent boys ability to play video games and walk during the entire opening credits the wiz is an unnecessary update of the wizard of oz and mr wizard is that guy that attached one hundred straws together and had some kid drink tang out of itnow that we have gotten all that out of the way let me say this there is really no reason to see this movie it is simply a one hundred minute nintendo commercial designed to capitalize on the powerglove the legend of zelda and super mario brothers three i use the word designed in the loosest sense possible because it seems like this movie was written over a weekend by a crack team of people who had never played nintendo and directed by a man with less sense of style than my grandmother maybe if the writer and director sat down and actually played some games together they would realize that they were about to film total rubbish and instead go to vocational school to learn how to install car stereosi hope that this has been an enlightening experience for you it sure has not been for me in fact i think i might have lost a few braincells in the act of watching this movie and writing about it next time you are at the video store and you see the the wiz the wizard and the wizard of oz all sitting there on the shelf in a pretty little row give them all a miss and play duck hunt instead,0
one of the most boring slashers ever if you can even call it that i would not watch this if it even ended up being some kind of porno movie which it completely resembles the fact that you are watching a small group of middleaged people in the woods is really unbearable they made these kinds of movies for teens so who were they really aiming for when they made this sleepfest my favorite part of this movie is the cover art and it is the only reason i chose to seek out this movie which happened to be part of a suspense classics fifty movie pack and after seeing the other movies in this fifty pack you will realize that it belongs nowhere else so if you are in the mood for a decent slasher in the woods i recommend just before dawn and the final terror,0
i was very unimpressed with cinderella two and jungle book two but this is possibly worse than both titles first of all i did not like the animation very saturdaymorningcartoon only worse in some scenes i liked some of the characters namely thunderbolt and patch but the other characters like cruella were mediocre cruella was truly villainous in the original but she lost her quality in the sequel what she said was nothing at all to write home about and her animation was kind of ugly also her artist companion lars was a joke to be honest with you and roger seemed to have quit smoking overnight the voice talents were very good though especially barry bostwick as thunderbolt with the exception of jodi benson the accent ruined it for me there were some good moments but the whole plot seemed bloated for me and highly suggestive of an extended tv episode all in all a hugely disappointing sequel to the most memorable of the sixtys disney movies along with jungle book sorry i can only give this a threeten it just was not my cup of tea bethany cox,0
for me this is a story that starts with some funny jokes regarding franks fanatasies when he is travelling with a staircase and when he is sitting in business meetings the problem is that when you have been watching this movie for an hour you will see the same fantasiesfunny situations again and again and again it is to predictable it is more done as a tv story where you can go away and come back without missing anythingi like felix herngren as frank but that is not enough even when it is a comedy it has to have more variations and some kind of message to it is audience,0
ruby in paradise is a beautiful comingofage story about a young woman ruby lee gissing escaping her stifling roots to become herself although the title character is played artfully by the gorgeous ashley judd  in likely her first movie role albeit one to be quite proud of  the emphasis is not upon becoming somebody a la the next madonna whether jesus mother or the lurid attentionhungry singerit instead emphasizes following ones instincts and being somewhat introspective about them to grow into ones ideal adult self note this is not an action movie it uses an occasional voiceover narration by ms judd while writing in her journal  and oh i see i have just lost the male half of the readers out there but be patient with this beautiful movie where we learn that ones bliss can be discovered in  oh i do not know carrying water and chopping woodactordirectorwriter todd field who played nick nightingale in eyes wide shut costars as ruby lees noble love interest one who helps her heal her idea of relationships implanted from youthbut not even his character is the answer for ruby lee there is no external hero imposed upon her the ultimate message is that we are responsible for ourselves writerdirector victor nunez who also wrotedirected ulees gold did an amazing job showing a young woman growing into herself  confronting ageold challenges of good v evil along the waythe supporting cast is also stellar and the music used particularly the cuts by chanteuse sam phillips whom i hear is the wife of t bone burnett is right on  most especially trying to hold on to the earth now when i hear the first few chords of that song tears spring to my eyes pavlovian and unbidden  not sure if it is the music or the indelible connection to the movies quiet charming message of empowermentthis movie is highly recommended for any young person trying to find hisher way for any woman of any age it is a must see the downside it is not on dvd except in spanish we learned however that it is legal to make one copy of a vhs version which can be readily found online my beloved husband found someone with a vhs copy and got a dvd copy made for me although this treasure of a movie occasionally pops up onair  on an indie channel usually  you cannot count on that when you might need it most as a tonic to soothe the pressures of the world so buy a copy for yourselfthis movie should have a major rerelease and it would if i were queen of hollywood figgy jones,1
this is at least the third remake of this movie so if while watching it there is a sense of deja vu do not be surprised all they did was change the setting of the story and tell it differently but the differences are not significant and it does not get any better because the plot is flawed to begin with it never works and like its predecessors the acting is mediocrethe plot has a unique ending which will surprise any one who has never seen the movie before but the ending does not fit the story had this movie ended ten minutes earlier it would have worked and have been very satisfying and i would have thought it more worthwhile but here is the spoiler and that in the end crime does pay because the criminal is not caught i never like this message resulting from a movie,0
at least it is not full of sensless violence or fluff it is also not very full of thought or a smooth storyline this story had some potential but the director appears to have lost site of the green the story is disjointed and goes off in strangedirections to no conclusion i also do not believe the director spent much time around a golf country club either some of the depictions are absurd not very engaging,0
who me no i am not kidding that is what it really says on the video caseplot short version pretty woman stands around smiling this for some reason makes all men kill each otherfind arielwhere is arielcannot find ariel she is right behind you you idiotmost of what can be said about this horrendous little space opera has already been said looks likea bunch of corny actors playing mostly convicts come in after the first selection of actors is knocked off very quickly then they get knocked off in the same way every scene is broadcast nearly fifteen minutes in advance perhaps it was a drawing of straws to see which actors had the most screen time and bigger pay check the alien virushologramvr witchglitch seems physically powerless and does not do a thing why cannot she just stay in the computer instead of doing her teleporting vampire routine actually it would have been more interesting if she had been a vampire or doing more than just standing around looking at people which is all she ever does this is enough to make all the men kill each other go figurethis is not really a space flick there are far more shots of the old western trail one thousand nine hundred and fiftys easy rider trail film noirs night club scene even a jog on the beach in fantasyland none of which has any real depth or even makes any sense the night club scene is in black and white of course worked with the wizard of oz does not work so well here this is probably a good thing as those few shots they do show of space are depressingly silly you will probably cry during those moments especially upon seeing that swirling space ship which looks about three inches longnothing is felt for any of the characters not because they are convicts or have no personality but because they are in serious need of acting lessons except for billy dee williams who really does look depressed and at a loss probably by being in this workthis is one of those movies that when viewed with friends is going to cause some extremely loud silences especially when the nerd throws out his attempt at comic oneliners including the line about frenchkissing a meteor did i hear that right perhaps notthe original virtual reality girls get killed which means nothing as they are not even real to begin with well the other characters are not either but that is beside the point hahawhat is kind of funny is that the scene that graces the video case is some sort of skullhorroralien looking thing green filter added on top of that to give it more of auhgreen look which is actually the android after he gets killed and ultimately has nothing to do with anything else afootanother odd deal i noticed whenever there is an explosion at least on my cheap dvd copy everything becomes highly pixelated i do not mean a little pixelated i mean huge blocks about onesixteenth the size of the screen wow,0
not the most successful television project john cleese ever did strange case has the feel of a first draft that was rushed into production before any revisions could be made there are some silly ideas throughout and even a few clever ones but the story as a whole unfortunately does not add up to mucharthur lowe is a hoot though as dr watson bionic bits and all good lord,1
i loved the original scary movie i am a huge fan of parody it is my favorite form of humor it is sometimes regarded as the most intelligent form of humor the wayans boys seemed to grasp that concept perfectly in the original film then temporarily forgot it when making the sequel i think the wayans are a family of comical geniuses alas even geniuses make mistakesthe movie begins with promise i liked the exorcist parody especially the come on out ma gag now that is wayansquality material but other than that i can only think of two other times i laughed one when tori spelling is seduced in the middle of the night by a spirit then becomes clingy and starts talking about marriage with him meanwhile he is saying it was just a booty call that was kind of funny two the save the last dance parody where the cindy character inadvertently beats up a girl while practicing her new moves but even the shortlived giggles are no match for the sidesplitting laughs of the first scary moviethe rest of the movie is pure trash filled with cheap grossout gags jokes from the first movie which were subtle or implied are magnified and overdone for example in scary movie i several innuendos are made to imply that the character ray is gay this was hilarious but in scary movie ii the whole penisstrangulation scene with ray under the bed was mindnumbing and incredibly unfunny this is the pattern of the whole film shock humor alone does not take a movie very far this was a trend in two thousand and two thousand and one unfortunately as much as it pains me to rate a wayans movie so low i have to give this one a two out of ten,0
what is wrong with you people if you were not blown away by the action car sequences and jessica simpsons hot body then you are majorly screwed in the head of course the film is not a masterpiece i do not think it was aiming to be it was fun and funny i never watched the show when i was younger i only recently saw one episode and when i watched the movie i felt it had the same kind of atmosphere the movie seats were practically shaking and the car sequences were good because it did not bore me and drag out like some of the scenes in twofast twofurious and jessica simpson is plain hot i just wish they had used her more in the action sequences all in all i had a hell of a time watching this and i would go and see it again soon and i will buy it on dvd people enjoy it for what it is,1
this movie was crap with a capital c the opening scene showed promise but that promise was broken shortly after the viewer learns where the plot is goingand the wooden statue morty who was rather creepy in the original film looks plain goofy in this one it was so obviously just a guy in a cheap plastic costume and by the way who else thinks morty is one of the most unscary names on planet earth it ranks right up there with jimmy or fred when it comes to horror value or why not just name the wooden statute henryfreakinkissinger run it is dr kissinger that would be about as scary as mortyand then there is a scene where the hero hits his fathers tombstone witha sledgehammer you might guessa twobyfour someone might venture no he angrily beats his fathers tombstone with a twiga freakin twig but worse than that once the characters walk away the tombstone actually and inexplicably bleeds oh brotherthere is also a native american guy who lives with the main characters grandparents but apparently does nothing except mortymaintenance he perpetuates creepy mortylegends warns those who scoff and even fixes mortys arm when it becomes damaged during a childish prank but for all his respect for and tenderness toward morty does morty give a rats hairy behind nothe movie drags on and eventually several people die in ways that correspond to their worst fears sort of this film is a real yawner do not rent it,0
brokedown palace is the story of two best friends alice and darlene who go on a spontaneous trip to thailand and wind up in prison after being caught with planted drugs in their luggage in this way the movie had the potential to turn into a serious and moving film such as return to paradise but instead the movie chose to focus little on the girls situation and more on their friendshipclaire danes and kate beckinsale both turn in excellent performances and the movie is much more about the interplay between them  the suspicion the jealousy the questioning and testing of their friendship and ultimately the sacrifices made in the name of friendship this movie chooses not to delve too deeply into politics or even into the harshness of prison life which is a bit glossed over and focuses more on these friendship issuesthere were some plot holes here and some parts that just did not seem believable or realistic we did not feel the real fear or hopelessness of their situation as well as we might have and we get very little feeling of life outside the prison walls with bill pullman playing the supposedly sleazy lawyer who actually turns out to have a heart of gold in short this should by all rights have been a much darker movie than it wasbut overall i enjoyed it the acting was good the soundtrack was perfect and the storyline had enough twists and turns to stay interesting worth seeing,1
man i really find it hard to believe that the wonderful alan ball had anything to do with this mess having seen the first two episodes thus far i think i can safely say this show is not going to be on my must see list it is just got so many things working against itnone of the actors cast are particularly good anna paquin as the lead character sookie is just awful i remember her being better in a lot of other things i have seen her in so maybe it is just the writing she is not really much fun to look at either there are moments where to be honest she looks downright ugly the actor who plays bill is marginally better if only because his character is supposed to be sort of wooden and aloof the other actors do their best but with the cliché characters with difficult to perform accents they are given it is a tough job tara is an absolute misery to watch rutina wesley absolutely murders the accent it is like nails on a chalkboard bad almost as awful is nelsan ellis it is difficult to understand what he is even saying sometimes both his character as well as taras also seem a bit racist to me i do not know having a character say whycome on an hbo show that is not the wire just seems a bit odd rounding out the cast so far are sookies doddering grandmother her sex addict brother and the only bit of genius casting i have seen in william sanderson as the sheriffthe story seems to be meandering towards it is destination at this point with no real worry about keeping the viewer interested the romance stuff is very dark shadowsy although this show ups the camp factor from something like those old dark shadows episodes times about ten at times it seemed so campy to me that i just have to assume it was intended to be but unlike a show such as buffy that pulled camp off masterfully this show does not out of place with the campiness is the extreme gore and graphic sex of the show i am not averse to either of these when they are done well as they have in many other hbo shows but here at least they prolonged rough sex scenes involving jason stackhouse seem a bit over the top and pointlessabout the only nice thing i can really think to say about this mess is that i liked the opening title sequence hbo has had a string of bad luck with their shows lately i hope they cancel this after the first season and try to get something better on the air,0
i love this movie jouvet arletty blier carné almost everything has already been said about the movie but there is one detail i would like to she would some light onto no footage of the real still standing hôtel du nord is it still i heard it was to be demolished has been used for the movie  the whole scene has been rebuilt on set the main reason being that they could not stop the traffic on the st martin canal for several weeks,1
presque rien is a story of two young boys falling in love during summer stay by the seaside i do not want to tell the plot because it is not what is most important about this film but you can be sure that it is interesting and original the best part of this movie is the cinematography the visual side of presque rien is so amazing it deserves highest note it leaves you charmed with its beautyas for the plot it is shown in uneven rather complicated way there is no simple chronology nor there are answers to all the questions the film brings but this is what makes presque rien even more interesting i recommend this movie to all the people for whom the artistic side of films is very important and they will not be disappointed,1
films such as chocolat beau travail and others have propelled french director claire denis into the top echelon of the worlds most unique and accomplished filmmakers and her two thousand and four film the intruder lintrus adds to the depth of her portfolio a cinematic poem that conveys a mood of abiding loneliness and loss the film provides a glimpse into the psyche of a man who is deteriorating physically and mentally and who travels to various parts of the globe seeking redemption and peace but finds it hard to come by loosely based on jeanluc nancys memoir of a heart transplant the intruder is a film of such unrelenting opaqueness that even after two viewings it is difficult to describe it in other than subjective impressionistic termslouis trebor michael subor is a man in his seventies who is likely dying of a heart condition and who like the professor in ingmar bergmans wild strawberries attempts to come to terms with the mistakes of his life while he has time it is clear that he is physically rugged and very wealthy but seems emotionally drained and the look on his face is one of quiet resignation though we see only one episode of violence where he gets out of bed in the middle of night to kill an intruder there is a sinister sense about him he might be an intelligence officer a foreign agent or a hit manwhatever the case he apparently is under some kind of surveillance and acts like a man that has been involved in criminal wrongdoing and is only now able to see the consequences facial closeups throughout the movie create a strong sense of isolation he lives with his dogs in a cabin in the jura mountains near the frenchswiss border and has an estranged son sidney gregoire collin whom he has long neglected sidney lives nearby with his wife antoinette florence loiretcaille and their two children in one telling scene he meets up with his father on the street and calls him a lunatic but that does not prevent him from taking his moneywhen the film opens we meet antoinette a swiss border guard who boards a van with a trained dog to sniff out some contraband when she comes home she is greeted by her husband who asks her with tongueincheek if she has anything to declare other than these three individuals the people and circumstances we see during the rest of the film may exist only in louis imagination louis has three women in his life and we meet them all in the films first half hour a pharmacist bambou who prepares his medication a neighbor béatrice dalle who is a dog breeder who refuses to care for his dogs when he goes away on a trip telling him that they are as crazy as he is and a young russian organ dealer katia golubeva who he tells he wants a young mans heartrelentlessly she stalks him throughout the film but it is apparently only in his mind in the last section of the film louis travels to south korea in search of a heart transplant and to tahiti to deliver a gift to a different son one whom he has not seen for many years or perhaps has never seen his heart transplant however appears to be a metaphor for a man without a heart a man whose life has been fascinating but ultimately directionless intruding into other peoples lives with little real empathy the intruder contains a haunting guitar soundtrack by stuart staples of the band tindersticks reminiscent of the guitar riff in jim jarmuschs dead man and gorgeous cinematography by denis regular agnes godardgodard creates memorable images that convey a mood of longing and regret a heart beating alone in the snow an infant in a sling looking up at his father for a good two minutes the babys expression gradually turning from morose to a half smile colored streamers blowing from a newly christened ship a massage in a dark room by a mysterious korean masseuse and the vast expanse of ocean seen from a bobbing ship deck while the intruder can be frustrating because of its elliptical nature denis forces us to respond out of our own experience to understand the images on the screen on a very personal level if there is any theme a hint might be found in the opening that tells us what is revealed piecemeal in the film  your worst enemies are hiding in the shadow in your heart,1
i have watched this movie twice and i plan to see it again it is the movie that puts you in the directors place regarding his romantic relations and the political situation in israel it also makes me cry because of remembering the wonderful time it was and the horrible murder described there it is really worth watching,1
not your typical vamp story not bram stoker or anne rice here a truly original vampyre story these vampyres are genetic mutants who the sunlight do not bother they are pure evil to the film is not perfect many of the actors are clearly amateurs the two leads who play van helsing and rally the vampyre chick are pretty good though the film is intensely violent which may disturb some people also it is loaded with scientific detail that many will find hard to understand and may get bored with i was sold on the clever storyline and the couple good performances no telling how successful this film could be if they had a bigger budget and it got mass distribution,0
it sounds as if it should be a biography of claude monet but it is actually a highly focused story of relationships between three adolescent girls on a french synchronized swimming team there are no parents or teachers to speak of no school and boys are represented by one peripheral figure the hunky francois who enters the story determined from time to time and always leaves confusedpauline aquart is the youngest of the three only aspiring to join the team she so much admires she is kind of odd looking she is not yet out of her adolescent growth spurt and has long bony limbs big feet and no derriere to speak of she is prognathous and sports these plump pursed lips after a while her appearance grows on you and from certain angles she can come to appear enthrallingadele haenel is older  more well more developed physically what a glamorous figure she cuts in her swim suit sauntering around teasing the boys swishing her long blond hair but she is not what she seems or is she i could not quite figure it out the french are long on paradoxes and short on consistency no wonder francois is always sniffing after herthere is not so much ambiguity in louse blacheres character she is on the team too but she is dumpy and plain and sensitive about it and has an intense crush on francois blachere is a good actress and adds to the ungainliness of the character through her performancethe movie deals with the relationships between these three meaning intrigues deceptions hidden feelings and all the rest of what we associate with young girls who spend much time with one another this is of course a tricky topic it becomes trickier during the gradual development of a homoerotic relationship between pauline and adele not that you should expect this to be a soft porn movie the only nudity we see is considerably less than a turn on and what little sex there is under the covers sometimes literallyi do not think i want to get into the plot or into its analysis too much partly because it is suggestive rather than expressed through action partly because it is complex and partly because i am not sure i got it alllet me give an example okay adele is the girl the others envy she is also quite distant and self satisfied on top of that she is apparently schtupping every boy and man in sight if they can be of any use to her at all from the handsome but dumb francois to the bus driver she wants a favor from she brags unashamedly about her expertise in fellatio when pauline approaches her about joining the swim team adele uses her as a lookout during assignations with the guys a superior and selfindulgent narcissist you know but then the soidisant slut takes the skinny pauline under her wing and reveals to pauline that she is still a virgin really yes really pauline begins to draw closer to adele and adele finally confesses that she would like to rid herself of her hymen and she would like pauline to do it for her pauline now drawn sexually to adele performs the task with subdued relish now adele would really like to get it on with a man preferably older and experienced so she takes pauline to a boite where she dances seductively with some guy until she follows pauline to the powder room the two girls stand there staring at one another neither having overtly expressed a sexually tinged interest in the other but adele stands so close that pauline slowly loosens her own reins reaches up and kisses adele on the lips adele steps back smiling and says there now that was not so bad was it and then walks back into the clubthat is a pretty close description of whatever is going on between pauline and adele  but what the hell is going on initially adele treats pauline like an irrelevant child later like a close friend finally like a potential lover  and the minute pauline responds adele walks off satisfied is she using pauline the way she seems to be using men does it satisfy adele to know that she now has another person in involuntary servitude i do not knowi have slighted louise blachere as the third member of the trio the plain and overripe wallflower whose expression always suggests dumbfoundedness but who at least is thoroughly heterosexual and the first of the three to rid herself of that noisome virginity but i have only skipped her for considerations of spaceshould you see it by all means just compare it to the typical american movie about high school kids for men some of whom have never penetrated the female mystique this may give you some idea of what it looks like in medium shot,1
nay sayers of this film are likely bitter from some seriously unrequited love this is a great film for anyone capable of understanding johnny mathiss song or any song from that era bobby darins beyond the sea or stan getzs the girl from ipanema et ali measure films by how many times i have to watch them before i am satisfied chances are had me back a few good timesi also watch the synergy between the cast i thought they worked well togetheropen your heart and let the comedic magic of film transport youalan,1
you can tell they spent five making thisit is a waste of your time ugh there is not anything remotely good about this movie  i do not know why i kept watching it the chick is not hot horrid acting you could do anything and its a better use of your time like watching tv playing shitty video games i feel robbed simply robbed of my time  i have never made a review for a movie before as you can probably tell but this movie i felt like i needed to save the poor souls that are about to watch it and looking on imdb before to see if its decent and looking at the comments there was no action no hot chicks no budget shittttttttttttttty acting it screams bad movie the whole movie is in a room,0
hard to categorize the film  perhaps it is an avant garde spy thriller mother night is a very good vonnegut novel and most certainly one of his easiest novels to adapt into a feature length film the film adaptation is very faithful to the original book the indie approach to how this film was produced is probably more effective than having a big hollywood studio financing it these days i doubt an intelligent novel like mother night would ever get the green light from the big hollywood grindhouses and normally that is too bad but not in this case mother night has tight direction and a solid cast nick nolte who seems to be getting better roles as he gets older still has that everyman persona that allows him to take on a wide range of different characters sheryl lee is beautiful and great as always i always thought she deserved better than she got out of the entertainment industry i guess making your debut as a dead girl twin peakswith little air time is not the choicest of roles even if the tv show becomes a minor phenomenon anyway this film is totally enjoyable and you do not have to read the book to understand the movie in fact given todays geopolitical realities the novels premise may appear dated and some younger viewers with little knowledge of history will be utterly confused by the events unfolding i am talking to you fellow americans who are students and scoring the lowest in the industrialized world in geography history and lord knows what other subjects,1
after perusing the large amount of comments on this movie it is clear that there are two kinds of science fiction moviegoers there are the ones who are well read extremely literate and intelligent they know the history of the genre and more importantly they know to what heights it can reach in the hands of a gifted author for many years science fiction languished in the basement of literature considered my most critic to be little more than stories of ray guns and aliens meant for prepubescent teenagers todays well read fan knows well this history and knows the great authors asimov heinlein bradbury and ellison who helped bring science fiction out of that basement in doing so they created thought provoking intelligent stories that stretched the boundaries and redefined the human condition this well informed fans are critical of anything hollywood throws at them they are not critical for it is own sake but look upon each offering with a skeptical eye as they should as hollywoods record has been less than stellar to these fans the story must take supreme importance they cannot be fooled by flashy computer graphics and non stop action sequences when the emperor has no clothes they scream it the loudestthe second type of science fiction movie goer has little knowledge about the written aspect of the genre look at many of the above comments that state well i have not read the book or anything by this author their total exposure to science fiction is from movies or the scifi channel they are extremely uncritical willing to overlook huge plot holes weak premises and thin story lines if they are given a healthy dose of wiz bang action and awesome special effects they are in effect willing to turn off their critical thinking skills or maybe they never had them for the duration of the movie case in point i robot while supposedly based on asimovs short stories and named after one of his novels it contains little of what asimov wrote and even less of what he tried to tell us about humanity and our robotic creations those of you that will run out and buy i robot will be very much surprisedthis movie is not even based on that story at all the film has enormous plot holes that at some points are stretched to the limits of credulity i will not point them out i will not spoon feed you you need to practice you thinking skills and discover them for yourself the characters which are named after many of asimovs characters do not possess the critical intelligence that was a hallmark of his stories the plot itself with all it is action sequences goes against everything that the author stood for his belief that humanity possesses the capacity to solve problems using their minds not their fists is vital to understanding his vision of the future in short other than the name their is very little of isaac in anything about this movie there will always be those uncritical ie unthinking who will state the movie does not have to be like the book due to the medium movies sometimes require that changes be made but what about a case where the movie never even tried to stay close to the book or books from the start what if all they took from the written work was the title this begs the question why tarnish a great body of work by slapping it is title on your vacuous piece of crap save money and do not buy the rights to the works title it something else do not use the characters names believe me no one will accuse you of plagiarism in fact it will not matter what you title it to the unread moviegoer who accepts everything you throw at him but it will upset those who read who think who are unwilling to simply let you give them a pretty light show i robot like much of hollywoods take on the genre pushes science fiction back down into that basement it lived in years ago hollywood could not do this alone it takes an uncritical mindless audience that will accept puerile dredge like this,0
this film was really eyeopening i have seen this film several times first when i was four and i actually remembered it and then when i was twelve the whole message that the director is conveying is for everyone to wake up and not make the mistake of leaving god out of our everyday lives or just plain going the extra mile to insult hima great movie for nonbelievers and believers alike,1
a film without conscience drifter agrees to kill a man for a mobster for money then they double cross him meanwhile he falls in love with the dead mans wife and without her knowing he is the killer moves in with her then he accidentally kills her when she finds out then in a walking tall kind of heroism he gets revenge on the mobsters who double crossed him the first problem is that by agreeing to take on the murder by hire assignment the drifter loses all sense of sympathy worthiness and heroism we cannot accept any goodness in him and as a result the rest of the has no moral center we just cannot care about that kind of guy and the wife nicely played by the fetching kari wuhrer  the sheriff in eight legged freaks a high class lady who runs a mission for homeless people similarly loses a degree of sympathy by jumping right into bed with the homeless drifter despite her evidently weakened state after the death of her husband and when she finds out he is the guy  what does she do she locks him inside her house as if all houses had locks you cannot open from inside with her and proceeds to berate him stoopid george wendt however is terrific in a role as a beefy thug director stuart gordon did so much better with reanimator and dagon,0
twenty years ago the five years old boy michael hawthorne witnessed his father killing his mother with an axe in an empty road and committing suicide later on the present days michael gordon currie invites his girlfriend peg stacy grant and his best friends chris myc agnew jennifer emmanuelle vaugier lisa ann kelly benson ned brendon beiser mitch maldive phillip rhys and trish rachel hayward to spend the halloween in the country with his grandparents in their farm he asks his friends to wear costumes that would represent their greatest innermost fear and together with his indian friend crow byron chief moon they would perform an ancient indian celebration using the carved wooden dummy morty jon fedele that would eliminate their fears forever the greatest fear of michael is to become a serial killer like his father but something goes wrong and morty turns into his father killing his friendsthe fear resurrection is a disappointing and pointless slash movie that uses the interesting concept of eliminating the greatest innermost fear of each friend before it grows but in a messy screenplay full of clichés there are some exaggerated performances like for example ms betsy palmer others very weak but in general the acting is good unfortunately there is no explanation why the dummy is brought to live further in spite of being surrounded by close friends the group does not feel pain or sorrow when each one of them dies the lowpace along more than fifty minutes could have been used to built a better dramatic situation in the very end michael shows a charm that his father was interested that i have not noticed along the story i do not know whether the previous reference was edited in the dvd released in brazil with eightyseven minutes running time the special effects are very reasonable for a bmovie my vote is fourtitle brazil fear two uma noite de halloween fear two one night of halloween,0
there have been some low moments in my life when i have been bewildered and depressed sitting through rancid aluminium was one of thesethe warning signs were there no premiere even the stars did not want to attend and no reviews in magazines the only reason i sat through the film was in the hope that i might catch up on some sleepnothing in the film was explained the narration was idiotic i cheered at one point when the lead of the film appeared to have been shot then to my growing despair it was revealed that he had not really been shot dampening my joy i sincerely hope all involved in the film are hanged for this atrocity there were some positive aspects mainly unintentional moments of humour for example the scene in which the main character for some unknown reason feels the need to relieve himself manually in a toilet cubicle while telling the person in the next cubicle to put his fingers in his earsmy words cannot explain the anger i feel so i shall conclude thusrancid aluminium for sadists wastrels and regressives only who want to torture themselves,0
i saw this movie about five years ago and the memory of it still haunts me to this day i was fully aware at how awful it was supposed to be going into it so i have only myself to blame but like most i did not believe all the negativity being a sandler fan it just seemed inconceivable one of his movies could really be that bad i figured it was just sandler haters i could not have been more wrongwhat we have here is a comedy that does not contain even one second of anything funny that is actually quite an accomplish you would think in a ninety minute comedy they might have accidentally stumbled upon something even remotely amusing but no it is just horrible it is not so bad it is good its just bad you cannot laugh at how bad it is you can only cry you wait patiently for a joke that will at least make you chuckle but they never comehave you seen the movie the ring where the people watch a video tape and die seven days later if this movie was on the video tape people would die instantly by their own hand and there would be smile on their face as they realize their agony has ended and that would be the first smile since they pressed playyou might be inclined to watch it just to see how bad it is unable to curb your curiosity do not please do not trust me i am doing you a favor there are two types of people in the world those that think going overboard is the worst movie ever made and those that have not yet seen it,0
most war films made in the us during wwii were great fun to watch but suffered from severe gaps in realism because they were being produced more for propaganda value to raise the spirits at home than anything else i am not knocking these films as many of them are still very watchable however because they so often lack realism they are prevented from being truly great films a perfect example was the john garfield film air forcein which a bseventeen nearly singlehandedly takes out half the japanese air force however pride of the marines is a welcome departurescoring high marks for portraying a true story in a reasonably accurate manner when i first saw this film i thought it was not a true story as it seemed way too improbable to be true however after researching further i found that it was in fact rather true to the amazing story of two men who did so much to earn the medal of honor this is one case where real life seemed too incredible to be true,1
i discovered this film after reading the book that inspired it it is not a strictly biographical film it is loosely based on the facts but i found it a compelling and eerie exploration of evil and madness and michel serrault gives an unforgettable performance as dr petiotthere are many memorable images in this movie petiot traveling through the night like a vampire his black cloak flapping behind him is almost iconic there are also several touches of expressionism  petiots crooked silhouette mounting the stairs leading from the cellar where the butchered remains of his victims await cremation reminds me of some scenes from nosferatubut i found the primary appeal of this movie to be aural the soundtrack is loaded with ominous sounds starting with the foreboding music of the opening credits accompanied by wordless wailing petiot lives and runs his medical practice in a complex with many small shops and there is a persistent background noise of knives being sharpened somewhere as well as a peddler playing eerie tunes on a saw there are animal noises as well  the concierge keeps a goat unseen cats howl  and later in the film we see hapless cattle being herded through an underpass the whole atmosphere is unsettling with overtones of violence and slaughternot only animals but human voices are often heard  the screams of gestapo victims petiots patients in his waiting room monitored by a listening device just the same as the suspected collaborators after the war are monitored in their cells even the action of the film is often arranged so that we hear the voices of the participants without seeing them  when petiot goes to see mme kern we hear her singing as she works her voice echoing in the theater before we ever see her and even when she does appear she is often filmed from behind her voice calling out to her husband whose voice calls out to her in conversation disembodied voices echo in large halls and their owners when seen at all are photographed at a distance so we cannot actually see them speaking this is a ghost story and these are the voices of ghosts  many of them petiots future victimsyet petiot himself is often only a voice his frightening laughter echoes as he retreats from the camera throwing comments behind him or into the air to nobody in a way he is as much a ghost as those he murders he is always frantically busy scurrying from appointment to appointment never at rest but his activity is that of a machine  lifeless and imperturbable it is interesting that among all the horror and danger of occupied paris petiot alone is unafraid he is amused enthusiastic angry irritated contemptuous but never afraid unlike those real people he lures to their deaths it is no surprise that he boasts of his mechanical inventions including a perpetual motion machine a true detail from the book  he did claim to have invented many machines he is a sort of perpetual motion machine himself and mechanical imagery is everywhere in the film from the opening giant wheel in the movie house to petiots bicycle with its squeaking wheels echoing the sound of sharpening knives to the victrola he keeps winding up to play music before he makes a kill even his routine with his victims is mechanical  write a note to your wife let me disguise you before you leave you need a vaccination barcelona casablanca dakar  like a welloiled machine the routine is always the same just as the record is always the samemaeder the author says that it was the clockwork perfection of his crimes that weighed so heavily against petiot at his trial his system was as smooth and efficient as a nazi concentration camp and this may be why the movie invents a subplot of petiots involvement with the french gestapo and the occupying nazis unfortunately it does not quite work as part of the story because it is very hard to figure out just what petiot is doing for the collaborators or what is going on when he ends up at their headquarters in the middle of the night disposing of bodies hiding stolen goods it is hard to say and harder to believe it is not likely the state would turn to a freelancer like petiotbut it does remind us of the duality of evil people petiot is a robber and a murderer but he is also a devoted father and husband just as we learned that hitler loved dogs and that nazis guilty of the worst war crimes could also be loving fathers and family men so we have to recognize that petiot could commit unspeakable horrors and yet also function normally his insanity is easily camouflaged by the insanity and horror of the wartime situation in paris when killing robbing and disappearing are happening all around nobody pays attention as petiot tosses more corpses on the pile,1
