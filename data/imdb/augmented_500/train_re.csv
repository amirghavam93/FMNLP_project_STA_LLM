0,there is no relation at all between fortier and profiler but the fact that both are police series about violent crimes profiler looks crispy fortier looks classic profiler plots are quite simple fortiers plot are far more complicated fortier looks more like prime suspect if we have to spot similarities the main character is weak and weirdo but have clairvoyance people like to compare to judge to evaluate how about just enjoying funny thing too people writing fortier looks american but on the other hand arguing they prefer american series  maybe it is the language or the spirit but i think this series is more english than american by the way the actors are really good and funny the acting is not superficial at all,1
1,this movie is a great the plot is very true to the book which is a classic written by mark twain the movie starts of with a scene where hank sings a song with a bunch of kids called when you stub your toe on the moon it reminds me of sinatras song high hopes it is fun and inspirational the music is great throughout and my favorite song is sung by the king hank bing crosby and sir saggy sagamore overall a great family movie or even a great date movie this is a movie you can watch over and over again the princess played by rhonda fleming is gorgeous i love this movie if you liked danny kaye in the court jester then you will definitely like this movie,1
2,george p cosmatos rambo first blood part ii is pure wishfulfillment the united states clearly did not win the war in vietnam they caused damage to this country beyond the imaginable and this movie continues the fairy story of the ohso innocent soldiers the only bad guys were the leaders of the nation who made this war happen the character of rambo is perfect to notice this he is extremely patriotic bemoans that usamericans did not appreciate and celebrate the achievements of the single soldier but has nothing but distrust for leading officers and politicians like every film that defends the war eg we were soldiers also this one avoids the need to give a comprehensible reason for the engagement in south asia and for that matter also the reason for every single usamerican soldier that was there instead rambo gets to take revenge for the wounds of a whole nation it would have been better to work on how to deal with the memories rather than suppressing them do we get to win this time yes you do,0
3,in the process of trying to establish the audiences empathy with jake roedel tobey maguire the filmmakers slander the north and the jayhawkers missouri never withdrew from the union and the union army was not an invading force the southerners fought for states rights the right to own slaves elect crooked legislatures and judges and employ a political spoils system there is nothing noble in that the missourians could have easily traveled east and joined the confederate armyit seems to me that the story has nothing to do with ambiguity when jake leaves the bushwhackers it is not because he saw error in his way he certainly does not give himself over to the virtue of the because of abolition,1
4,yeh i know  you are quivering with excitement well the secret lives of dentists will not upset your expectations it is solidly made but essentially unimaginative truthful but dull it concerns the story of a married couple who happen to be dentists and who share the same practice already a recipe for trouble if it was not for our separate worklives we would all ditch our spouses out of sheer irritation campbell scott whose mustache and demeanor do not recall everyman so much as ned flanders from the simpsons is the mildmannered uberdad husband and hope davis is the boredstiff housewife who channels her frustrations into amateur opera one night as dad  the daughters attend one of davis performances he discovers that his wife is channeling her frustrations into more than just singing he witnesses his wife kissing and flirting with the director of opera one nice touch we never see the operadirectors face dreading the prospect of instituting the proceedings for separation divorce and custody hearings  profitable only to the lawyers  scott chooses to pretend ignorance of his wifes indiscretionsalready the literate among you are starting to yawn hohum another story about the pathetic sniveling little cuckold but rudolph who took the story from a jane smiley novella hopes that the wellwornness of the material will be compensated for by a series of flashy postmodern touches for instance one of scotts belligerent patients denis leary kept relatively  and blessedly  in check will later become a sort of construction of the dentists imagination emerging as a devilontheshoulder advocate for the oldfashioned masculine virtues dump the bh etc when not eggedon by his imaginary new buddy scott is otherwise tormented by fantasies that include his wife engaged in a threeway with two of the male dentalassistants who work in their practice it is not going too far to say that this movie is eyes wide shut for real people or grownups at least along those lines campbell scott and hope davis are certainly recognizable human beings as compared to the glamourpuss pair of cruise and kidman further the script for secret lives is clearly more relevant than kubricks as proof i offer the depiction of the dentists children particularly the youngest one who is about three or four years old and whose main utterance is dad dad dad dad dad dad this is family life all right with all its charmsthe movie would make an interesting doublebill with kramer vs kramer as well one can easily trace the feminization of the american male from one thousand nine hundred and seventynine to two thousand and three in this movie dad is the housewife as in kramer but he is in no way flustered by the domestic role unlike dustin hoffman who was too manly to make toast here scott gets all the plumb chores such as wiping up the childrens vomit cooking cleaning taking the kids to whatever inane afterschool activity is on the docket and all without complaint and without directorial commentary it is just taken for grantedthe film has virtues mostly having to do with verisimilitude however it is dragged down from greatness by its insistence on trendy distractions which culminate in a long scene where a horrible fiveday stomach flu makes the rounds in the household we must endure pointless fantasy sequences initiated by the imaginary ringleader leary whose existence by the way is finally reminiscent of the brad pitt character in fight club and this finally drives home the films other big flaw lack of originality in this review i realize it is been far too easy to reference many other films granted this film is an improvement on most of them but still the secret lives of dentists is worth seeing but do not get too excited about it not that you were all that excited anyway i guess,0
5,while this movies style is not as understated and realistic as a sound version probably would have been this is still a very good film in fact it was seen as an excellent film in its day as it was nominated for the first best picture oscar losing to wings i still consider wings to be a superior film but this one is excellent despite a little bit of overacting by the lead emil janningsjannings is a general from czarist russia who is living out his final days making a few bucks in the one thousand nine hundred and twentys by being a hollywood extra his luck appears to have changed as he gets a casting callto play an imperial russian general fighting against the communists during the revolution naturally this is not much of a stretch actingwise but it also gets the old man to thinking about the old days and the revolutionexactly what happens next i will leave to you but it is a pretty good filmparticularly at the end by the way look for william powell as the russian director despite being made in one thousand nine hundred and twentyeight with the makeup he does not look much younger than he did in many of his later films,1
6,i give this movie seven out of ten because the villains were interesting in their roles and the unknown batwoman creates an interesting guess who game the movie however needs more robin in it he appeared in the movie in the beginning and sporadically throughout the rest i always thought the new animated series did little justice to the neat new robin character let alone knightwing this movie just continues that bad tradition the movie spends too much time on bruce wayne and his romance which would not be so bad in one movie if the romance was not so unbelievable it is still a good movie if you are a batman fan and i would recommend watching it,1
7,really awful lead actor did ok the film plot etc was completely crap and inaccurate it may as well have been a sequel to well anything it had little or no relevance to carlitos way and should be avoided like the plague by any carlitos ways fans no mention of gail in fact he ends up with some other bird no mention of klienfelt no mention of how he got caught no mention of how he ended up in jail they attempted to make it like the original with flash backs at the beginning but to be honest when rating it i was looking for a zero mark unfortunately i had to rate it higherits a terrible attempt to cash in on what was one of the best films of the ninetys overall it was approximately £six and two hours of my life wasted for all the action in it it was truly boring slow and predictable again to any carltios way fans avoid this fiasco,0
8,good grief i cannot even begin to describe how poor this film is do not get me wrong i was not expecting much to begin with let us face it a pgthirteen slasher flick is predestined to be missing the ummm slashing so no one should be surprised by the lack of gore but it was the level of incompetence and cliché on display in all the other aspects of this movie is what really blew me away we have a protagonist who is quite simply so completely useless that you find yourself rooting for the bad guy and here is a turnup for the books she never changes  hence breaking the cardinal rule of basic screen writing  character development if you think by the end of this film the poor little girl is going to turn around and finally kick some arse then think again on top of this we are handed possibly the least intriguing and definitely the least scary killer ever to grace the genre i am not joking when i say that dora the explorer has scarier villains than this moviefinally because all the potential for tension or gratuity is removed by the inept and apparently thirteenyearold director what could possibly be left to fill up two hours of screen time closets that is what lots and lots of closets big closets small closets mirrored closets closets to narnia so many damned closets you will not want to dress yourself for another year in fact this movie should have just been called closet and had a picture of a big scary coathanger on the dvd case on the back it could have had a photograph of the audience falling asleep and a quote by roger and ebert  something to the extent of what the f did we just waste our time watching,0
9,home room deals with a columbinelike highschool shooting but rather than hashing over the occurrence itself the film portrays the aftermath and what happened to the survivors their trauma guilt and denialspoilers the shooting itself is treated as a foregone conclusion with no action footage other than the reaction of an almost teenage swat commando after shooting the high school killer the film has three protagonists the detective investigating the crime of which no guilty parties are left to convict and two teenage girls surviving the incident played by a very young erika christensen and busy philippsthe two girls having nothing in common besides the shooting are put together because of it and the drama ensueserika christensen though only twentyfour has been around the block so much that film viewers are pretty much acquainted with her solid and reliable style of acting busy philipps three years older than christensen and altogether unknown to me blew me away with her overwhelming dramatic strength and screen presence this girl was the partit is a great movie and it connects to you with its intimate focus on the fragile yet growing relationship between the two traumatized girls gus van sants elephant two thousand and three though good seems almost superficial and paltry compared to home room when it comes to dramatic flair and acting what i can see this film got very little screen time and exposure  so much more a loss for an equally traumatized americaten out of ten,1
10,this begins a wager between edgar allen poe and a journalistpoe bets that the man can not spend an entire night in a creepy castle well of course he can but will he come out unscathed hard to say with all these strange people that are not supposed to be there wandering around including the icy barbara steele this is a fairly odd film in that the presentation is both in french and english and switches back and forth a few times perhaps this is done because bits of dialog were lost it is also rather dark and claustrophobic being that one does not see much beyond a small circle of light that candles and such generate plus there is a feel of dread and impending doom pretty much at all times this version on synapse is also uncensored and i wondered what might be censored in a film from one thousand nine hundred and sixtyfour until i saw the topless scene i guess that might be it overall this is pretty good and in gloomy black and white barbara steele definitely makes the movie too eight out of ten,1
11,last weekend i bought this zombie movie from the bargain bin and watched it with some friends thinking it was going to be a budget version of land of the deadboy was i wrong it seems as if they spent a good portion of their budget on the coverart which is very misleading to fans of the zombie genrewe watched up to the point where the zombie chicks come alive and get in the car with some yuppie who is out in the middle of nowhere talking business on a cellphone they actually speak to the guy before one of the girls kills him but once they started driving the car i could not suspend my disbelief anymoresome people actually consider this a so bad it is good movie they are liars i did not finish the movie but one of the other reviews mention that they actually somehow become police officers at the end of the movie which makes me glad to not have watched it all the way throughthis is even worse than zombiez do not watch,0
12,well the reason for seeing it in the cinema was that it was a sneak preview else i would never have seen this terrible teenage slasher movie i mean have not we had enough of this yet scream and scary movie at least did not take them self serious the plot sucks and the acting is the worst i have seen only godzilla can compare which is also the only movie that competes in being the worst i have seen in the cinema with this onethere is so many plot holes in the story and the girls are so alike that you do not even now who has been killed and who has not and you do not care the only of them i knew in advance was denise and she was the most talent less actress i have ever seen in this bad excuse for a moviestay as far away from this movie as possible twoten,0
13,we have an average family dads a famous rapper we have the rebelious teenage daughter the adopted white kid and the cute little kid and we have careless housemaid what show has had a housemaid like that do we have a messedup brady bunch yay when it first came out i thought it was really cool mostly because i was young the music was bad the raps were so bad and they were too grated all of his raps were about his family and friends and problems the dad was kind of the danny from full house type of dad always gave the advice out but he was not a clean freak they had a housekeeper for that remember the plots were basically lil romeo was in trouble of some sort or not that is it oh and maybe some preteen drama yeah that stuff is good not really but its still a good show for kids but nikelodean could do better,0
14,when my sister said this movie was going to be good i had second thoughts but i watched it and it was actually funny basically the movie is made of a weird girl who goes to a small town where no one likes her and she just wants to go there and get the reading of her aunts will don so she can go but its not all that easy in this movie you will come across hilarious humor a witch a book of spellsrecopies a mentally challenged uncle and a dog you will understand the meaning of the word freak a after anyways i hope you run right out and try to find this really old movie hope you like it in total i will have to give it a zero no i am totally joking ill give it a nine hope you understand that you will laugh you will scream and you may just be offendedlove yours truly dakota you can email me at dakotalovesithot mailcom if you want to,1
15,i thought this was a wonderful movie it touches every fiber of a human being the love in the film is very intense i thought it was wills best performance to date great directing liked the editing music was great good use of flashback this is the kind of movie everyone should go see i hope people will get something wonderful from this overall excellent movie i think hollywood should make more movies with substance even action films can have a caring story i like the fact that will was very subtle in his acting he had a purpose and a dedication that is rare to see i would suggest watching this alone or with someone that you really care about for me i found that the world stopped and my only focus was on the film the outside world was suspended for a moment it was a nice feeling with all this chaos going on in this world and with this me generation it was great to see somethingsomeone that cared about other people more than himself,1
16,why on earth is colin firth in this pointless film has he really been that strapped for cashthe film is not clear on what it wants to be about grief exotic places ghosts a vehicle for mr darcy it is a muddled muddy messthere seems to be some sort of idea that italy must be good in itself and that italian has something to offer as a language  but in the end the girls just want to go back to yanklandthere are pointless episodes on the beach in churches on busy roads  but what it is all about or why anybody should care simply is not clearthere was also a yank woman in the film it was not clear what here job was but she seemed only to be there to make vapid inappropriate and maudlin comments to the girl was it supposed to be about paedophilliaa pretty dreadful mess all in all i gave it two rather than one because it does not have the charm of an utterly ghastly film,0
17,back in one thousand nine hundred and eightyfive i caught this thing i cannot even call it a movie on cable i was in college and i was with a high school friend whose hormones were raging out of control i figured out early on that this was hopeless stupid script a bunch of old guys hiring some young guys to show them how to score with women bad acting with one exception and pathetic jokes the plentiful female nudity here kept my friend happy for a whilebut even he was bored after thirty minutes in rememberthis was a high school boy this was back before nudity was so easy to get to by the internet and such we kept watching hoping for something interesting or funny but that never happened the funniest thing about this was the original ad campaign in which the studio admitted this film was crap one poster had a fictional review that said this is the best movie i have seen this afternoon only grant cramer in the lead showed any talent and has actually gone on to a career in the business nobudget and boring ta skip it,0
18,it is easy to forget once later series had developed the alien conspiracy plot arc more that once upon a time the xfiles wrote episodes like genderbender and fearful symmetry where the aliens were not all little grey men or mindcontrol goop but could actually surprise youfearful symmetry starts with an invisible elephant  actually an elephant somehow dislocated in space and time not a mile away from the walk  and ends with a pregnant gorilla being abducted and it is very much an episode of wonderful moments the subplot is annoyingly worthy  yeah we get it zoos are bad except when they are not  but the ideas that within it are fascinating visually powerful and very memorable and it covers an angle on abduction that is largely overlooked  why would humans be the only things that aliens are interested inin the end it was not an instant classic but it was enjoyable viewing while it lasted again very memorable and mainly it is something that you could not imagine many other shows doing,1
19,grey gardensone thousand nine hundred and seventyfive is the maysles brothers bizarre documentary of jackie bouvier kennedy onassiseccentric aunt and first cousin who live like pigs in a run down twentyeight room mansion on east hampton long islandbig edie bouvier bealeseventyeightwitty and dry and her daughter little edie bealefiftysixemotionally about thirteen a still beautiful woman who once had a promising futurelive in isolation from the rest of the world except for their many cats and raccoons in the attic they amuse themselves by bickering all day listening to the radio or singing to each otherthey do not even own a television their fall from society is amazing to learn of and the viewer is drawn to these two very special although obviously dysfunctional peopleone of the better documentaries ever made and still a cult classic today,1
20,i am usually not one to say that a film is not worth watching but this is certainly an extenuating circumstance the only true upside to this film is cornelia sharpe looking rather attractive and the fact that this film is really shortthe plot in the film is unbelievably boring and goes virtually nowhere throughout the film none of the characters are even remotely interesting and there is no reason to care about anyone i am not sure why on earth sean connery agreed to do this film but he should have definitely passed on this onethe only reason i could see for seeing this film is if you are a diehard sean connery fan and simply want to see everything he is done save this one for last thoughwell if you by some miracle end up seeing this despite my review or any of the other reviews on this site then i hope you enjoy it more than i did thanks for reading,0
21,not funny  how can anyone link this to monty python that is absolutely ridiculous  there are no laughs this is not funny over the top but ugly weird just for weird sake and it seems to me these people were on something all the time unfortunately something that did not make them funnyit should be given some points for effort etc whatever actually it appears there is a laugh track  or is there one hummm since there are barely any laughs that is a debatable questionmaybe i am doing it injustice  maybe it is some sort of exercise some sort of art  in that case anything goes never mindbut these guys playing women with highpitched voices turnedup noses come on  not funny there is only one heir apparent to monty pythons intellectual wit and that is stephen colbert and maybe jon stewart,0
22,okay i rented this movie because of the directorhe has made some interesting flicks in the past if you have not seen waxork you are missing a fun ride anyway i had my doubts about this movie from the beginning but i decided to suck it up and give it a look it is bad very bad if you have not seen the movie and do not mind spoilers read ahead first of all the old saying you cannot judge a book by it is cover applies here the box for this flick seems to indicate that jill is the stone fox with long hair with highlights the back of the box has a cool shot of the redleather jill and some other shots the description makes you want to rent the movie because it sounds good you start watching it and suddenly you find out that the movie takes place inexplicably in one thousand nine hundred and seventyseven jill is a total dog who is not the girl on the cover the movie is not quite as predictable as you would thinkand that is not a good thing characters do so many stupid things without any modicum of motivationit is embarrassing to watch ten minutes before the end of the movie dolph and another lady have sex for no good reason also what was the point of having dolph kill this other lady in cold blood who had been helping him anthony hickox the director should have seen a stinker when he read the script had it been set in the underworld of the new milennium and made the characters halfway intelligent it might have been decent to set it in the seventys makes no sense and has no bearing on the story whatsoever avoid it,0
23,this obscure de sica delivers the goods and it is said the meek shall inherit the earth this tale of classes on the surface but really an allegory for all the homeless people that populated europe after the great war they are homeless but cheerful in a societies too impoverished and selfish to care for or acknowledge them footmats for the italian carpetbaggers de sica chooses to tell it as a fairy tale a cinderella story i have not read the book it is based on so i cannot foresay if the deus ex machina is the construct of the writer or vittorio it begins with the words once upon a time to exemplify the timelessness of its tale for the story could be set anywhere and everywhere caricature sketches of the aristocracy that cut to the bone whimsical nature of the homeless especially when they begin to grant their wishes and an ending right out of a spielberg picture makes this boulange a delight for all de sicas most accessible picture is also one of his best abandoning neorealism he always dallied between that and pure good old filmmaking he creates a movie that breaks the heart and at the same time fills it with the yearning of hope that one needs to continue leaving in this world gracias vittorio gracias gracias gracias,1
24,wes craven you are having a laugh at our expense the red eye plot is preposterous we are confronted by a guy who has apparently spent eight weeks watching a girl who then turns up at an airport behind her flirts and chats her up successfully somehow wangles a seat next to her in a two seat space not trapped in the middle of a five seat row contacts at checkin and is cheezily nice during a painfully slooooow build up then once up in the air in a confined space surrounded by strangers he immediately starts threatening the vacuous if superefficient rachel mcadams and saying tosh like we got ya daddy do what i say or poppa gets it well forgive me but did not they already have her daddy ready for slaughtersoyoubetteroughta long before she stepped on the plane and therefore would not it have been oh sooooooo much simpler to simply snatch the gal off the street and terrorise her in a room somewhere forgetting the complicated and insecure dad plot pulling her nails out or whatever until she made the all important call required or even  cos this is the movies and we need a few unreal twists  keep the dumb dadindistress thing intact if you must but dress it up better so that holding him in harms way until the convoluted plot had been concluded made some sense without the plane dumbdown alternatively without wanting to sound like an actual thinking terroristassassin  could not the massive bazookamissile thang employed have been far more easily used on say a car driving down the highway with the politician inside rather than the fiftyth story of a miami seafront hotel from a fishing boat mind you as we already know security in miami is lax so they will speed away i know i know far more fun to go through watching a pretty girl for eight weeks burgle her dads house to steal his wallet that somehow  star trek style  gets transported from miami to texas instantly in order to  perhaps  get her to arrange for a politician to change hotel room and and and well a thousand things could go wrong here each one entirely destroying the big plan so why not slim the elements down to a sensible handful such as  one bazooka two car three boom my fifty minute drive home from the cinema was spent highlighting the abundance of flaws and stupid codhitchcockian twists which sadly was the best fun of the whole sorry experience and as for security back at miami airport we have an apparently crazy and violent girl running off a plane chased by cops who during the chase sits down to have a coffee moves elsewhere to read a magazine at a bar then runs again like crazy up and down the whole terminal by now also chased by crazed cillian murphy no cctv then  i had guns pulled on me for parking in the wrong place for ten seconds at miami airport a couple of years back so instead of speaking to the cops  her allies  or getting on the blower at a callbox direct to her dad to warn him his life is in danger mcadams prefers instead to steal a people carrier off a family in the airport forecourt call the damned security and drives home to daddy mowing down the assassin with the vehicle in the front garden of the house in a rich neighbourhoodwatch district crushing the front porch in the process  an act which actually slightly wakes dad up from an afternoon snooze after about a minute yet which somehow fails to register with neighbours who are not even mildly curious thus ensuring fifteen more minutes of hide and seek shenanigans as the duo run around the vast hollodeck type house dohhh it actually hurts to keep thinking about it all  cillian surely renamed silly un for doing this one preposterously turns from ice assassin to comically unhinged and inept lunatic killer at the end this theoretically ruthless despatcher of human life now allowing the dad to live so that he can watch his daughter getting her goose cooked i would better stop because the stream of drivel i am writing here must sound as uncoordinated as the red eye script if ms mcadams had not been allowed to get on the plane in the first place the title could have been altered from red eye to no eye dear rr,0
25,i love horses and admire hand drawn animation so i expected nothing short of amazement from dreamworks new animated picture spirit stallion of the cimarron i guess you could say i was a little bit disappointed you have wonderful animation and at first what seems like a perfect story a story about absolutely nothing but a horse in nature the animals do not sing cute songs or even talk  a major plus sadly the film has an uncalled for narration by matt damon a sappy soundtrack by bryan adams and enough action scenes to compare it to a jerry bruckheimer production if the film makers would have just stayed with simplicity we would have a masterpiece here this is not a great film but it is good entertainment for small children i would recommend this film to families because it has its heart in the right place and its the only thing out there right now that is not offensive to small children not bad but could have been much better very pretty visuals though,1
26,the first and only time i saw shades was during a sneakpreview it had not even been in premiere i remember there was someone of the directors staff there do not even remember who it was a belgian movie we never heard of it so we were quite neutral not knowing what to expect mickey rourke is a brilliant actor and he is stands miles ahead all the rest he plays an actor who is star has long stopped rising he is helping to realise a movie in belgium entitled shadesas soon as the movie started we noticed how much swearing there is nothing against the occasional swear word however this was way beyond annoying whenever rourke uses the f word to express something it comes naturally however when someone from the cast a nonenglish speaker uses the f or s word it becomes arrogant and aggressivewe quickly lost count of how many times they used the f and s words everybody was just glad to be out of the theatre and we had to give a vote but it was hard for us because it was only from zero to ten and we were looking for the ten,0
27,i seriously love this film so much i never get sick of watching it the only line i really cannot stomach in this is when riff calls herself a teenage lobotomy but other than that everything else is perfect i have never been a fan of pj soles and it did not help to hear that she did not even know who the ramones were until she filmed this movie but i can ignore her snarly little face for the most part most people who watch this over and over are fans of the ramones and really that is the only reason i love it so much i never get tired of seeing deedee mess up his pizza lines or joey mess up the name of the teacher over and over haha one of the best parts of the film is seeing them sing do you want to dance  down the halls of the high school i love it the special edition dvd has a good retrospective surprisingly pj soles is not on it maybe she was working on another project laugh anyway great film even better if you are a ramones fan,1
28,this is the best scifi that i have seen in my twentynine years of watching scifi i also believe that dark angel will become a cult favorite the action is great but jessica alba is the best and most gorgeous star on tv today,1
29,it is good to see that vintage film buff have correctly categorized their excellent dvd release as a musical for that is what this film is pure and simple like its unofficial remake murder at the windmill one thousand nine hundred and fortynine the murder plot is just an excuse for an elaborate girlie show with kitty carlisle and gertrude michael leading a cast of superdecorative girls including ann sheridan lucy ball beryl wallace gwenllian gill gladys young barbara fritchie wanda perry and dorothy white carl brisson is also on hand to lend his strong voice to cocktails for two undoubtedly the movies most popular song it is heard no less than four times however it is gertrude michael who steals the show not only with her rendition of sweet marijauna but her strong performance as the heros rejected girlfriend as for the rest of the cast we could have done without jack oakie and victor mclaglen altogether the only good thing about oakies role is his weak running gag with cult icon toby wing in fact to give you an idea as to how far the rest of the comedy is overindulged and overstrained superdumb inspector mclaglen simply cannot put his hands on the killer even though would you believe in this instance it happens to be the person you most suspect director mitch leisen actually goes to great pains to point the killer out to even the dumbest member of the cinema audience by giving the player concerned closeup after closeup,1
30,i just finished watching this movie it was not ridiculously bad but i am really disappointed with it i am not really sure why someone would make a movie like this it was marginally entertaining but i feel like the people making it had a lot of disagreements on what they were making monday the writer was in charge tuesday the director wednesday the guy who gets the coffee etc it almost seems like they really wanted to make a couple different movies but only had the time and money to make onesomeone else commented that the acting was really good but i would have to disagree then again if the actors were able to keep a straight face during the filming perhaps they are better actors than i give them credit forthe back of the dvd gives the impression that the movie would be a mystery something along the lines of a historical law and order or national treasure it starts off like that but then out of nowhere it takes a turn towards a bad episode of the twilight zone or what was that other show that was not as good a bad episode of the outer limitsmy main complaint about the movie is that it is just so played out there is the evil guy with spiked white hair there is the love interest who when she first appears the wind actually blows through her hair seriously once you realize it is a christian movie the end is also pretty easy to spotthe cinematography was poorly done especially in the opening scenes  way to put your best foot forward it was not atrocious for most of the movie but there was the occasional ridiculously bad shot of an old lady praying arms up in a dark room while lightening is striking  the sort of thing that just makes you a little bit embarrassed to be watching the movie,0
31,slither is a horror comedy that does not really have enough horror or comedy to qualify as one or the other it has one scene that is exceptionally good any number of zingers that work but very few real scares and not enough humor to maintain the movie in addition the script does not focus on the hero and heroine and goes off kilter in several placesa major failing of this film is that it introduces and then leaves its hero fillion to follow grant grant michael rooker as he is first introduced and then becomes the monster this whole part of the film drags  michael rookers character is not that interesting to us as a person and watching as he goes through a series of motions while acting in the monsters interest might be interesting if this was grant  portrait of a man turning into a monster rather than a horrorcomedy alien invasion movie in the final analysis this movies problems are in the script  it is not that important to the audience how the monster acts or propagates the purpose of a horrorcomedy is to get the heroes backed up in a corner with shotguns and then throw bugs at them with them cracking wise every time something frightening or disgusting happens instead we get an exploration of the aliens habits and tactics that just makes this part of the movie drag the ostensible heroine elizabeth banks as starla grant is more central to this part but nonetheless i felt the movie had left its narrative track unless it planned on following grant grant all the way to the endwhen fillion and his posse finally confront the alien the movie does begin to cook but once again the problem is in the script by this point that audience knows  and the characters should know  that grant is not just suffering from some disease and act accordingly shotguns  instead they continuously parley in the face of increasing evidence that this is not something that let us get you to a hospital is going to help although their reactions might have been human and real these are characters in an action movie and simply should have done what the movie promised  delivered action a lack of action scenes in a movie with as few ideas as this is a great failing spoilers ahead  after the first confrontation and the bursting of the alien larval sack a minor character and perhaps the best scene in the movie the script once again betrays the movie at this point one of the characters is almost taken over by the alien and develops an insight into the alien the writerdirector gunn chooses as this character a completely new character rather than one of already developed minor characters why why did he need to introduce a completely new character more than an hour into the movie that becomes central to the plot by the time this character is attacked we know hardly anything about her and could care less about her even though she is a winsome teenage girl in her bath had gunn decided not to use this character and just used one of the established minor characters he could have completely avoided introducing her family and saved time and money furthermore the hero and heroine would have been filled in on the aliens plans without all the additional characters and could have gotten around to blowing away aliens sooner and with more vigormy last criticism is based on the movies look gunn is primarily a writer or maybe it was budgetary constraints but this movie looked ugly and uninteresting most of the action takes place at night in woods or on a field and the screen simply looks drab the sets in wheelsy the fictional town where the action takes place look cheap the whole movie looks cheap box office mojo states the films budget was fifteen million newspapers say twentynine million and considering they did not use any name talent i would say the money did not show up on screen the monster is just repulsive and rarely looks deadlythe last criticism is primarily based on the reality of the characters actions by the time fillion and co have begun hunting grantthe alien one woman has disappeared and grant is known to have been mutilating animals at this point i was expecting the fbi or at least the state police to show up and take over from the hick sheriff a woman has disappeared and likely been murdered and a local has been acting psychotic time to call the authorities but basically i was hoping that would happen because i just wanted some characters who would show up and actalthough this movie is ostensibly a horrorcomedy the movie it bears the most resemblance to is dreamcatcher in terms of monstrous invasion and the type of monster and its intentions whereas dreamcatcher had much bigger problems with story especially the entire morgan freeman subplot and particularly the ending in many ways it was stronger primarily because the main characters were stronger but more importantly because it looked beautiful although that may be anathema  preferring the movie that is weaker in general plot and structural spine because of production values  that just shows you how uninteresting i found the look of slither,0
32,gus van sant has made some excellent films i truly am a fanhowever i cannot help but feel that the cerebral edge of tom robbins book even cowgirls get the blues is lost in translation to the big screen alone tom robbins and gus van sant are incredible visionaries and towers of talent ultimately though this one just did not work it was not that the characters were not well developed or the plot and content did not come alive it is just that our imaginations are much more powerful when reading a book like this we are taken away to a different time and place and we sometimes think the worst andor the best and it adds to the overall rollercoaster of the book as it neatly unfolds according to the authors precision movies however can leave one with less of the imagination and emotion rollercoaster detracting from the overall experience this is what i believe happened herei suggest reading the book,1
33,what an appalling piece of rubbish who are all these people who blubber on about how good this is yes it is arty and yes it is foreign but  that is not enough the plot is boring and disjointed like a reality show but not so slickly madethe people are intrinsically uninteresting but as characters they do not have enough depth to feel empathy for them if they are based on real people then i feel very very sorry for themthe violence and some of it is very violent seems quite ostentatious and gratuitous it is like the producer has visions of being quenton tarantino not that i think very much of him eitherand oh yes if i had neighbours like these i would move,0
34,this is a formula b science fiction movie and the director made no bones about it it is about a dragon who is restored to life by a scientific team everything done is stuff you have seen many times before it is a weak script with no real characters in fact it is full of stereotype characters and situations the director attacks this by just making it a formula movie with no attempt to fool us and that gives this movie a mild appeal but it is not something you are likely to remember a while it is best seen while you are cooking cleaning working out sort of mindless fun it has its place in entertainment but it certainly is not something you sit down with friends to watch unless you are all just drunk and do not care the mass rating of threetwo is probably fair i do not think it is as crappy as most people but i am surprised that some people in the postings thought this was spectacular that really eludes me as i see no attempt to even make this a memorable film,0
35,i was living rawlins when this movie was made and i got lucky enough to be able to work on it both as an extra and with eddie surkin on special effects it was fun to see all the behind the scene workings from the barbedwire coming alive to the electric chair up through the wardens office floor also it was a lot of fun getting to meet all the actors from viggo to tiny also the gate that was cut into the prison wall for the movie was and still is called disney gate by locals if anybody is interested and is ever in rawlins most of the movies sets are still in place and can be seen during the self guided tour it was a lot of fun working for and with r harlin and wished i had a chance to do it again,1
36,i think that my favorite part of this movie the one that exemplifies the sheer pointless stupidity and inanity of the proceedings comes at the climax of the film doctor ted nelson and his unmarried friend the sheriff have finally cornered the melting man on a landing on some stairs in an electrical generating plant keep in mind that nelson has been looking for the mm for nearly the entire film and that the mm has killed and eaten several people at this point including his boss and nelson is very aware that mm is violently insane and hungry for human flesh and bloodso the sheriff has his gun pointed at mm who is and i give the movie and rick baker props for this the most disgusting and terrifying object in human form that we have ever seen and he yells a very important question to doctor ted nelson what do we do now the camera cuts over to doctor ted nelson and it is obvious that ted has no idea what to do next apparently ted was so intent on the problem of finding the melting man he never thought to bring along some restraining devices a lasso or straitjacket or a net or some tranquilizer darts or maybe a new age tape by vangelis to soothe the savage beastso the sheriff panics and shoots the melting man goes berserk and hilarity ensues maybe this explains why nasa has been screwing around with the space shuttle program in sublunar space for the last thirty years instead of going back to the moon or out to mars like everyone knows they ought to be doing i do not knowanyway that is the kind of lousy lazy writing and direction that undercuts every aspect of this movie it is hard to say how good the actors actually are because the movie has complete contempt for their characterstwo other incredibly painful sequences also ramp up the stupidity of the proceedings there is a scene featuring the lumpiest old couple in the world trying to steal lemons from a grove only to be torn apart by the melting man this scene is a nadir in seventys cinema i can guarantee you have never watched a more pointless and irritating setup with odder looking people in your entire life and the melting mans assault on the lady who lives in the house where they keep a horse who pees on the walls defies every attempt to process itby the way i think famous film director jonathon demme has a walkon in this scene as the redneck husband who goes in first to check on the house and never comes out again the only thing that keeps the actress from literally chewing the scenery is that as i said their horse has apparently been peeing on it and we are forced to watch her hysterics for at least two minutes longer than any sane film director would hold the shot burr debenning ought to beat the crap out of imms director and photographer i remember him from an old columbo episode where he looked much better than he does here  no ones idea of a leading man but solid and unobtrusive but no one could possibly be as unappealing in real life as his director makes him look here everyone else comes off a little better except for the old couple and shut up i know they were being played for laughs but i are not laughing but not much this definitely falls into the so bad you cannot look away category of cinema disasters still i would watch it again before i would watch a lot of other seventys and eightys abortions  track of the moonbeast and it lives by night come to mind and msts coverage of it is great fun so if you get a chance watch the mst version,0
37,quite possibly how francis veber one of the best comedy directors in the world at least when sticking to his native france managed to turn in a film so completely unwatchable is beyond the reason of mere mortal man to discern it is not just that the characters are so unlikeable or that the film is so utterly devoid of even the lowest form of wit it is genuinely physically painful to watch such an endless parade of inept writing acting and filmmaking that you cannot believe this is the work of experienced  and talented  filmmakers for once the neareternity spent in the cutting room and on the shelf before its blinkandyou willmissit theatrical release tells the whole story what were they thinking,0
38,as someone who was staggered at the incredible visuals of hero i was anxious to see this film which was billed as being along the same lines but better it also featured an actress i like ziyi zhang well i was disappointed on both counts i bought the dvd of this film sightunseen and that was a mistake it was not betteri realize these flyingthroughtheair martial arts films are pure fantasy but this story is stretched so far past anything remotely believable it just made me shake my head in disappointing disbelief a blind woman defeating hundreds of opponents sorry that is going a little far also the major male character jin takeshi kaneshiro was so annoying with his dialog stupid look on his face and stupid laugh that he ruined the film toodespite the wonderful colors and amazing action scenes this story  to me  just did not have an appeal to make it a movie worth owning this film is no hero of mine,0
39,this movie was horrible simply put it was so bad i registered with imdb to warn you of its dangersi am a campy horror film expert per se i have watched redneck zombies house of the psychotic women slumber party massacre ii and many others i know my schlock and i know this movie sucksthree fourths of the film is comprised of scared individuals running from one side of the screen to the other when they are not running they are spouting nonsequitur lines devoid of emotion or motivation when the actors begin to be acceptable the direction falls to pieces there were so many jarring lowangle shots i figured leif jonker had a three foot tall tripod he used what i call the leif maneuver several millions times that is zooming out from an object of interest like an amateur apparently the film crew could not get up early enough to film a sunrise so they filmed a sunset and played it in reverse with direction this lazy you are actually impressed with the final gory scene the only thing you can figure is that the last five minutes was filmed before the first eightyfive minutesif you want a good bad gory movie rent rikioh or the foundational dead alive if you are a schlock buff and are looking for a challenge give darkness a goquote of the movievampire it is die time,0
40,this film failed to explore the humanity of the animals which left me with an empty feeling inside spoiler ahead i was not convinced that dr d really had a compelling reason to forego the big buyout deal to help his furry friends whereas babe the original bucked the trend of bigbudget hits by focusing on the human virtues of the animals vs their humans counterparts all the animals in this film were nothing more than comical caricatures which one would gladly stuff in the meatgrinder even more so if one could understand their pointless babble without eddie murphys zany behavior this film would be a flop,0
41,thhetwo is entertaining in that you will laugh a lot and cringe and probably say oh sht and get your face away from the goddamn hole you dumbs or things along those lines but i do not know if its really worth seeing i was very annoyed throughout the entirety with the horrible military characters who do not seem to know the first thing about combatyes there was more violence gore and a higher body count than the first one but i am still am debating whether that cancels out my feeling throughout the whole movie about how ridiculous it is and not a good ridiculousness like dead alive or feast my time would have been better spent watching ajas remake for the fiveth timeso go for some laughs or go for some gore but do not go hoping to come out of it satisfied,0

43,back in the days before the toxic avenger the lowcamp kings at troma films tried to take the high ok somewhatlesslow road of producing straight slasher pics i would like to think that viewing the results here is what convinced them to give up all pretension and go for selfconscious parodysplatter university is another film for the masochists in the audience as it meanders about through two separate casts and innumerable pointless subplots it actually becomes painful to watch let us see if i can summarizeafter learning that a dangerous psychopath has escaped from a local hospital the action moves to a catholic university i do not recall the name but in honor of the title let us call it st splatter the students are listless and sullen and argue pettily with each other slackers ahead of their time meanwhile the new professor julie parker proves utterly incompetent at her job the kids deal with relationships infidelity unwanted pregnancies lecherous priests and how to avoid doing any work in class julie deals with a creepy boyfriend the inflexible administration at st splatter counseling unwed mothers and the blank expressionless looks of her students none of it means a darn thing or gets resolved in any meaningful way oh and every once in a while a pov shot comes along and stabs one of the girls to death but do not hold your breath waiting for it there is a red herring killer and then a sadly anticlimactic confrontation with the real killer then it is back to the asylum and roll creditsthe slow pace and numerous inane subplots seem almost calculated to produce a mounting sense of frustration in the viewer which is helped along by choppy editing coffeecan sound quality and dialog that just does not make any sense and the most agonizing thing about this movie is the killers fixation on women  the men in this movie are just so deserving i would have paid good money to see someone off the jerk with the pregnant girlfriend or the lunkhead lothario who was fooling around with his girlfriends roommate or any of the creepy priests there are not no justice,0

45,frailtyeighttenit is nonsensical title and bill paxton directs headline aside this is a pretty good old fashioned rip snorting biblical horror thriller in the end it may end up only being the inbred southern gothic cousin of kubricks the shiningbut hey that is a pretty damn entertaining notion it is also got a doozy of a plot twistand a very ambiguous moral message this is the kind of movie that years from now people will catch late at night on basic cable and scare the beejesus out of themselves watching it too bad director bill paxton had to go hire himself to staroh wellstill a devil of a good rent,1
46,the sopranos is probably the most widely acclaimed tv series ever so naturally my expectations were through the roof and yet the show surpassed them i love the mafia and crime genre in film and i enjoy following the compelling stories set in these worlds but this is so much more eightysix hours of material gives the story a chance to not only be one of the most thrilling and unpredictable mafiaaction stories but also to be a great family drama a shocking character study a laughoutloud comedy a brilliant psychological examination dealing with the nature of good and evil and an intellectual arty collaboration of representative dreams and hallucinations all in one david chases epic series manages to accomplish all of this and more and cements hbo as the closest tv can get to cinematic perfection paving the road for a number of other series to continue blowing audiences awayrealism is present when it is needed but chases decisions to depart from it for effect on occasion for dream episodes and the like only adds more layers to the series chasealong with a strong writing staff including matthew weiner and terrence winter future creators of mad men and boardwalk empire respectivelyturns new jersey into an intricate universe full of the greatest cast of characters i have seen on tvjames gandolfini domineers the show as tony one of the most groundbreaking characters on tv ever tony adheres to half of the mobster stereotypes from pop culture but he defies the other half entirely and through his family interactions and his therapy sessions with dr melfi lorraine bracco with whom he has a considerable chemistry that ensures that the therapy scenes always have a completely different feel to the rest of the show we see nearly every side to tony soprano and learn that he is more of an everyman than one would expectedie falco matches the power of gandolfinis performance as tonys wife carmela from her mixed feelings about tonys lifestyle to her suspicions about murders to her torment over tonys cheating to her own thoughts about infidelity carmela runs the gamut of emotions throughout six seasons and falco makes her the prime vehicle for the non mafia viewers to have eyes into such a corrupt world scenes between tony and carmela provide some of the most heartwrenching and painfully realistic drama ever seen on televisionthe supporting cast is almost as phenomenal and a wide array of characters populate the cast over all six seasons somehow without any redundancies nancy marchand steals the show as tonys overbearing mother livia an insight into tonys personality problems and panic attacks the familiarity of marchands incessant complaints is almost gruesome since she takes the character so believably far michael imperioli is christopher tonys protégé whose various poor choices lead him down a road that is painful to watch but brilliantly executed drea de matteo plays christophers girlfriend adriana and is so well meaning and loving that the dark arc her character takes as she gets too involved with christophers career tony sirico is paulie introduced as the ultimate mafia stereotype and a source of comic but eventually he becomes one of the most sympathetic and complex characters on the show and nobody plays true anger better than he and that is just the tip of the icebergfamiliar faces such as peter bogdanovich jon favreau ben kingsley lauren bacall will arnett nancy sinatra david strathairn robert patrick hal holbrook burt young and eric mangini make appearances over the course of the show while names as notable as joe pantoliano steve buscemi and steven van zandt have regular roles as main characters in the series there are fifty great characters with powerful arcs and the excitement and tension never let up in any of the various subplots throughout the showcomedic elements and entire episodes filled with brilliant hilarity dilute the powerhouse dramatic intensity of the series which is so multipurpose that for one reason or enough the credits of nearly any episode left me somewhat bewildered the sopranos is the most powerful and addicting series i have seen overall and its highs are so mindblowing that i would have to call it my favourite show in spite of arguable lows most of which i disagree withwhether you love or hate the ending or what you make of it is irrelevant the discussion it has created is an achievement in itself the iconic nature of the entire series makes it an essential part of television history there are multiple elements for anyone to love and marvel at in this show so if you are thinking of watching something else instead do yourself a favour and fuhgeddaboutit,1

49,with no affinity towards any type of filmmaking and a healthy appreciation of documentaries i can honestly say i was angry at myself for bothering to sit through the entire length of twenty dates i will not waste your time with the plot you may read other reviews i will say though that berkowitzs hyper woody allenstyle narration was extremely annoying you either wished he would lay off the coffee or ingest some tranquilizers and it is potentially apparent to berkowitz himself that this film was a bad idea as parts of it details his trials to finance the documentary forgive me for disguising insults as compliments but i will give credit to berkowitz for having the skills to convince some idiot to finance this horrid piece of  i appreciate the boundaries  intentions of the film here but even when regarding the standards berkowitz sets for himself he fires off and misses on all levels in closing i am sure many of these female companions were not at ease going on a date with a twitchy want tobe filmmaker and therefore i question the films sense of authenticity hey myles i loved your film the first time i saw it when it appeared as an episode of seinfeld or was a film directed by woody allen or kevin smith,0
50,when i was a kid i totally loved both bill  ted movies the other night bogus journey was on and since it was at least five years since i last saw it i decided to tune in and i loved it all over again this film is still funny after all those years excellent adventure is better but this one rocks just the same sure some of the perfomances are a bit cheesy but hey this entire film is cheesy in a cool way plus it features the coolest personation of death ever in a movie concluding totally like non bogus movie dude way excellent station,1
51,cry freedom is an excellent primer for those wanting an overview of apartheids cruelty in just a couple of hours famed director richard attenborough gandhi is certainly no stranger to the genre and the collaboration of the reallife mr and mrs woods the main white characters in their book and in this film lends further authenticity to cry freedom the video now in release actually runs a little over two and a half hours since twentythree minutes of extra footage was inserted to make it a two part tv miniseries after the films initial theatrical release while the added length serves to heighten the films forgivable flaws uneven character development and blanket stereotyping in particular another possible flaw the insistence on the white characters fate over that of the african ones may work out as a strength viewing crying freedom as a politically and historically educational film as i think it should over its artistic merits the story is one which black africans know only too well though the younger generation may now need to see it on film for full impact it is the whites who have always been the films and the books target audience hopefully driving them to change now twelve years after the movies production cry freedom is in many ways a more interesting film to watch almost ten years after black majority rule has been at least theorically in place one thousand nine hundred and eightysevens cry freedoms ideals remain by and large unrealized it therefore remains as imperative as ever for white south africans particularly the younger ones who have only heard of these actions to see it and absorb the films messages in total contrast to american slavery and the jewish holocausts exposure south africans struggles have been told by a mere two or three stories cry freedom cry the beloved country ok count it twice if you include the remake and sarafina did i miss one all three dramas also clumsily feature american and british actors in both the white and black roles not one south african actor has played a major role white coloured indian or black and yes i did miss another international south african drama mandela and deklerk though this also highly recommended biopic was released after black majority rule was instituted mandela was played by a black american sidney poitier who also starred in the original sathemed cry the beloved country while the afrikaner deklerk was played by a bald very british michael caine a good performance if you can dismiss that the very essence of afrikanerdom is vehement antibritish feelings until local sabc tv and african films start dealing with their own legacy cry freedom is about as authentic as you will get as villified as the whites particularly the afrikaners are portrayed in the film any observant noncasual visitor to south africa even now in one thousand nine hundred and ninetynine not to mention one thousand nine hundred and seventyseven when cry freedom takes place will generally find whites attitudes towards blacks restrained even understated looking at cry freedom in hindsight it is amazing that reconciliation can take place at all and it is but cry freedom at time shows not much has really changed in many peoples minds yet and that the black africans goal to freedom and reconciliation is still ongoing this is why if you are a novice to the situation cry freedom is your best introduction,1
52,this movie is like real life by which i mean  not a lot happens in the available two hours or so and not much game plan or plot is evidenced by the frequently invisible cast their invisibility being due to the experimental lighting as mentioned by many reviewers a big bore no big surprise that altman helms this  he is a very variable performer yes we all loved gosford park but pret a porter anyone kansas city dr t and the women aaargh but the fact that the raw material is a john grisham tale and the excellent cast that you will perceive through the gathering gloaming of your insistent slumber  makes this truly a masterpiece of bad film and no it is not so bad it is goodit is just bad,0
53,i have seen miracles still happen now at least four times i never tire of this fantastic movie from the very beginning it holds a persons interest as the movie progresses and the plane crashes the story becomes very intense as we watch this young girl trying to survive alone and frightened in the amazon following a plane crash in which she was the only survivor losing her mother in this plane crash as well makes this movie even more dramatic as we see the perils this young girl had to endure during her ten days in the amazon to think this really did happen is just unreal and to think that anyone could actualy survive this is unspeakable as we see the wild animals snakes and other reptiles the enormous forests and wildlife as well as countless insects as the movie progresses we see the many dangers this girl has to face as she tries to follow the river in hopes of it leading her to a town remembering what her father told her about how a stream will always lead to a river and then into an even larger river and this means it will eventually lead to a community this young girl keep track of the tiny stream which eventually lead into a huge river all throughout the movie at times having to swim in dangerous waters alone frightened injured she always managed to keep going towards the end of this movie it was obvious she would not have been able to continue much longer as she had not eaten in ten days and only had water to drink and was very sick and tired from her perils eventually as she sees a canoe she realizes there has to be a village and men find her and they take care of her and then take her to a hospital where her father comes to see her after fearing she was dead along with the many other passengers such a dramatic movie and so heartwarming to see her fathers face when he sees his daughter is actually still alive after all this time in the amazon movies like this are not made much those days i will still see it again and i know i will never tire of it to think this girl was the only one single survivor of this airplane is just unspeakable also the fact she only maintained a few very slight injuries was even more remarkable whereas everyone else on this airplane perished in the horrific crash into the wilds of the amazon a brilliant movie superbly acted out indeed and one i will treasure forever and love to continue watching strongly recommended by me for sure,1
54,i am not sure if it is available worldwide  but if anyone who is deciding what is supposed to be put on videotapes and distributed in video clubs  is reading this  please  please buy it if i was not clear get the movie into videostorescannot be explained  must see,1
55,a year or so ago i was watching the tv news when a story was broadcast about a zombie movie being filmed in my area since then i have paid particular attention to this movie called fido as it finished production and began playing at festivals two weeks ago fido began playing in my local theater and just yesterday i read a newspaper article which stated fido is not attracting audiences in it is limited release with the exception of our local theater in fact here it is outdrawing all other shows at the paramount theater including three hundred of course this makes sense as many locals want to see their city on screen or spot themselves roaming around in zombie makeup and for any other locals who have not seen fido yet but are considering it i can say there are many images on screen from the school to city park to the forbidden zone that you will recognize in fact they make the okanagan valley look beautiful that is right beautiful scenery in a zombie movie however fido itself is a very good movie yes despite its flaws it is better then most of the twenty other movies playing in my local market fido is best described as an episode of lassie in which the collie has been replaced by a member of the undead this is a clever premise and the movie even goes further by taking advantage of the one thousand nine hundred and fiftys emphasize on conformity and playing up the coldwar paranoia which led to mccarthyism furthermore it builds on the notion that zombies can be tamed or trained which george romero first introduced in day of the deadksun ray plays a small town boy who is mother carrieann moss longs for a zombie servant so she can be like all the other house wives on her block however his dad dylan baker is against the idea as he once had to kill his own zombie father eventually the family does acquire a zombie named fido played by billy connolly and adjusts to life with the undead billy connolly was inspired casting he is able to convey fidos confusion longing hatred and loyalty through only his eyes lumbering body and grunts connolly shows that he can play understated characters better than his outrageously comedic ones this is his best role since mrs brownfido follows in the footsteps of other recent zomcoms such as shawn of the dead and zombie honeymoon being someone who appreciates bruce campbell and misty mundae movies more than eli roth and jigsaw ones i prefer humor over gore in my horror however i understand the criticism of those horror fans who feel there is not enough undead carnage in fido yet i am sure patient viewers will be rewarded by the films gentle humorthe movie does break down in it is third act it is as if the writers were so wrapped up in the cute premise of domesticated zombies in the one thousand nine hundred and fiftys they forgot about the story arc however given my interest in horror comedies and my appreciation for seeing the neighborhood on screen i rate fido nine out of ten,1
56,i caught this at a test screening all i can say is whatthehell this movie plays out about as smoothly as mickey mouse reading the script for scarface it is bizarre beyond making the slightest bit of sense and even if you do leave your brain in the car the film is still so bizarre that it is not even funnythe plot involves crocodile hunter steve irwin trying to save a crocodile which contains a cia probe the cia comes after irwin to get their probe back irwin mistakes them for poachers and sets out to stop themthat is about all the story there is the rest is overthetop lampooning of australian culture didja see dat and crikey and strangely choreographed action sequences at one point irwin mounts a speeding rv and knife fights with a cia agent on top of it yes that is right steve irwin knife fights a guy on top of an rv let that be your guide for this ridiculously bad film,0
57,in my opinion this is a pretty good celebrity skit show i enjoyed seeing greg kinnear as the host there are many reasons why i said that even though hal sparks was an okay host i sometimes wish that greg kinnear had not left if you ask me it seems that nobody stays with a tv show throughout its entire run anymore still i enjoyed seeing the various hosts and other people spoofing celebrities if you ask me that was pretty darn funny before i wrap this up i must say that i kind of miss this show now in conclusion i highly recommend this show to all you diehard sketch show fans you will really enjoy it,1
58,my abiding love of italian actress lucianna paluzzi who helped jumpstart my puberty with her performance in one thousand nine hundred and sixtyfives thunderball has led me to some fairly unusual places case in point this british curiosity from one thousand nine hundred and fiftynine carltonbrowne of the fo which features lucianna in one of her earlier roles she plays a princess in this one although the picture is actually a showcase for the talents of terrythomas and peter sellers both of whose stars were certainly on the rise at this point in this cute often very funny film we learn of the madeiralike island nation of gaillardia which had been a british colony until one thousand nine hundred and sixteen and then universally forgotten fortythree years later however it becomes the center of worldwide attention and international espionage when valuable cobalt deposits are discovered there and her majesty sends the bumbling carltonbrowne of the foreign office to take charge terrythomas underplays this part nicely as does sellers in his role as prime minister amphibulos of the tiny country this was sellers second film of one thousand nine hundred and fiftynine concerning a tiny country matching wits with the world the other being the mouse that roared of course ian bannen almost steals the show here as gaillardias suave king and my girl lucianna is as appealing as can be in her minor role the film exhibits much in the way of very dry humor although there are some belly laughs to be had the reception at the gaillardian airport for example and especially that may daystyle parade of gaillardian strength and sellers seedy prime minister with his cracked english and seemingly perpetual sweat stains is yet another memorable character in this great actors pantheon despite the occasional instance or two of indecipherable stiffupperlip british gibberish i found this picture to be a winningly modest entertainment and well presented on this crisplooking anchor bay dvd,1
59,what is good about it some inventive and genuinely creepy little effects that will get under the skin of even the most seasoned horror fan does not rely on the hackneyed soundtrack stabs for its gotcha moments even if you have seen everything there is still a few things in this film that will make your jaw dropwhat could have been better about it the acting was at times flat and unconvincing it had a shotonvideo quality in some places thoughit mostly achieved the atmosphere it was striving for and the camera work is full of needless closeups of meaningless actions though the effects are genuinely creepy i think they may have gone to the well a few too many times with some of them the ending seemed rushed and glossed over what could have been more impactful moments the viewer is left to figure out a lot of things for themselves not as a challenge by the filmmakers but because they just missed itstill a good little indie horror film that is easily several steps above the average well worth the rental,1
60,bloodsuckers has the potential to be a somewhat decent movie the concept of military types tracking down and battling vampires in space is one with some potential in the cheesier realm of things even the idea of the universe being full of various different breeds of vampire all with different attributes many of which the characters have yet to find out about is kind of cool as well as to how most of the life in the galaxy outside of earth is vampire i am not sure how the makers meant for that to work given the nature of vampires who the hell they are meant to be feeding on if almost everyone is a vampire i do not know as it is the movie comes across a low budget mix of fireflyserenity and vampires movies with a dash of aliensthe action parts of the movie are pretty average and derivative particularly of serenity but passable they are reasonably well executed and there is enough gore for a vampire flick including some of the comical bloodspurting variety there is a lot of character stuff most of which is tedious coming from conflicts between characters who mostly seem like whiny immature arseholes primarily cowboy dude and asian woman there are a few character scenes that actually kind of work and the actors do not play it too badly but it mostly slows things down a nice try at fleshing the characters out but people do not watch a movie called bloodsuckers for character development and drama the acting is actually okay michael ironside hams it up and is as fun to watch as ever and at least of a couple of the women are hot the space sfx are not too bad for what is clearly a low budget work the story is again pretty average and derivative but as i said the world created has a little bit of potential the way things are set up bloodsuckers really does seem like the pilot for a tv series character dynamics introduced the world introduced but not explored etc the film does have a some highlights and head scratching moments the kind of stuff that actually makes these dodgy productions watchable the scene where our heroes interrogate a talking sock puppet chestburster type creature hilarious  the sex scene wtf indeed the credit and michael ironside as muco the most annoying aspect of it all though is the really awful and usually inappropriate pop music they have playing very loud over half the scenes of the movie it is painful to listen to and only detracts from what is only average at bestbasically an okay watch is you are up for something cheesy even if it is just for the chestburster scene,0
61,movies have put me to sleep before but no movie has ever done that twice so it took me three sittings actually to finish it the dialog was bad women spoke stiltedly and the men were caricatures and two of the supposedly japanese women looked chinese had chinese names and spoke with clearly chinese accents i am still trying to figure out why the emmenthal men were sexually wrapped up with each other ten minus eight onetwo equals a tough choice do i give this movie a rating of one or twomovies have put me to sleep before but no movie has ever done that twice so it took me three sittings actually to finish it the dialog was bad women spoke stiltedly and the men were caricatures and two of the supposedly japanese women looked chinese had chinese names and spoke with clearly chinese accents i am still trying to figure out why the emmenthal men were sexually wrapped up with each other ten minus eight onetwo equals a tough choice do i give this movie a rating of one or two,0
62,it is obviously illegal pedophiles pray on stuff like this how did they get away with making such a movie this movie is all summed up in one word sick where do people get off making and watching these kinds of films as i was watching the movie i did not actually think they would allow this kid that is say maybe twelve if that actually sleep with this woman sorry if this is a spoiler to you but i would have rater not seen this where has the sanity of these people gone maybe the makers of this movie are pedophiles our society today is filled with all types of sexual predators that pray upon children yet film makers make these types of movies that do nothing but provoke this type of behavior i noticed that on a previous comment someone asked if there was a version where it showed them naked this is a kid here and someone is asking something like this what is wrong with this picture,0
63,i am a huge fan of the comic book series but this movie fell way below my expectations i expected a heavy metal two thousand kind of feel to itslow moving bad dialogue lots of bloodbut this was worse than anything i could have imagined the plot line is almost the same as the comic but the good points pretty much stop there the characters do not have the energy or spirit that drew my attention in the comic series the movie only covers a small portion of the comic and the portion used is more slow and boring than later parts the focus in the movie is on the insignificant events instead of the more interesting overall plot of the comic bookwith the right people working on this project it could have been amazing sadly it was not that way so now there is yet another terrible movie that few will see and even fewer will love my copy will surely collect dust for years until i finally throw it out,0
64,if you like gangster type of movies then this is the first one you should buy or at least rent al pacino his performance is top notch and the story is classic ten  ten  why is not this movie in the top two hundred and fifty list,1
65,while the threed animation the highlight of the show did it is job well most other elements fell flat it was as though the filmmakers thought well it is going to be threed so we do not have to work that hard on the plot or character development and the fact that it is a childrens movie is absolutely no excuse the public is drawn to three dimensional characters shrek nemos dad just as much as they are drawn to three dimensional graphics the only dimension any of the main characters showed was two dimensional scooter who twists the plot from time to time with his compulsion to eat everything in sightand the absolute kicker buzz aldrins appearance at the very end after watching a very robotic cartoon version of the same historical figure for an hour and half comes on the screen and ruins everyone is good time by calling the films main characters contaminants and announcing that the situation put forth on screen was actually an impossibility did you just want to tell the kids the easter bunny and santa claus do not exist while you are at it,0
66,ariauna albright is a really good actress but why she participated in this lame written travesty is a mystery what could have been entertaining winds up as classic boredom the unique thing about ariauna is that she can act as well as look real sexy as opposed to her partner lilith stabs who looks fine but it is obvious she spent the money for acting school at the spa or beautician this was a production that cried out for some t  a  with a imaginative script writer could have achieved it in the flow of things however ariauna does what she can under the circumstances  to a extent salvages her reputation the tempe company should be aware that when you dress two attractive women in skimpy fetish cop uniforms the viewers will expect some fetish play  t  a nough said,0
67,it is a strange thing to see a film where some scenes work rather weakly if only in comparison to other films in its legacy and others in a subplot or supporting story are surprisingly provocative and strong sudden impact is one of those cases where clint eastwood as starproducerdirector shows when he can be at his best or at his lessor of times when dealing with a crimemysterydetective story in his dirty harry fame we get that make my day line and unlike in the first film where his do i feel lucky speech was playful and cool the first time and the second time at the end tough as nails here it is switched around he gets into another shamble with the department as usual when he tries to fight crime his way in particular with a diner robbery inspiration for pulp fiction and with a high speed pursuit with a senior citizen bus he is told to take a vacation and that is the last thing on his mind this whole main plot is not very convincing aside from the expectancy of the story and lines which just adds to the frustration but soon his story merges with the subplot that eastwood develops from the startenter sandra lockes character jennifer spencer whom we soon learn after some appropriately mysterious scenes that she and her shy sister were victims of a cruel unjust sexual assault err outright rape and is sleekly undercoverlike getting revenge her scenes and story are the strongest parts of the film the most intense and finally when it goes into callahans storyline he is getting facts in the same small town she is in on a murder the film finally finds a focus between eastwoods classic form of clearly defined good vs evil though sometimes blurred to be sure eastwood films the flashbacks not to say too much about them expertly in a fresh experimental style the trademark lalo schifrin score is totally atmospheric in these scenes and in others it almost seems like a couple of times an arthouse sensibility has crept into eastwoods firmly straightforward storytelling style which helps make the film watchableit is a shame though that in the end it goes more for the expectable or maybe not expectable points and until the third act callahan does not have much to do except his usual it is smithwessonand me shtick however with locke he gets out of her a very good performance more subtle and touching than the one in the gauntlet and an exciting climax at an amusement park in a way i do and do not agree with eberts remark that it is like a music video in eastwoods style here i admit there is comparisons with the simplicity of both the directness but the scenes where eastwood does break form are superior to those of any music video it is cheesy it is hardedged it is not up to par with the first two harry pictures but hey there could be worse ways to spend a couple hours with the master of the fortyfour,1
68,the sunshine boys was the hilarious one thousand nine hundred and seventyfive screen adaptation of neil simons play about a retired vaudevillian team played by walter matthau and george burns who had a very bitter breakup and have been asked to reunite one more time for a television special or something like that the problem is that the two still hate each other and want nothing to do with each other richard benjamin appears as matthaus nephew a theatrical agent who has been given the monumental responsibility of making this reunion a reality this warm and winning comedy is a lovely valentine to a forgotten form of entertainmentvaudeville and it works mainly thanks to one of neil simons better screenplays and outstanding work by matthau burns and benjamin burns won the best supporting actor oscar for this but i think matthau walks away with this film with his flawlessly hilarious performance as willy clark matthau was nominated for best actor but did not stand a chance against nicholson for one flew over the cuckoos nest however in another year this was an oscarworthy performance matthau commands the screen and there is not a false note in this beautifully timed performance the scene where he is auditioning for a potato chip commercial and cannot get the name of the product right is a classic the sunshine boys is a warm and winning neil simon comedy which shines thanks to unbeatable chemistry between matthau and burns,1
69,this is a review of the wizard not to be confused with the wiz or mr wizard the wizard is a lateeighties film about a seriously silent boys ability to play video games and walk during the entire opening credits the wiz is an unnecessary update of the wizard of oz and mr wizard is that guy that attached one hundred straws together and had some kid drink tang out of itnow that we have gotten all that out of the way let me say this there is really no reason to see this movie it is simply a one hundred minute nintendo commercial designed to capitalize on the powerglove the legend of zelda and super mario brothers three i use the word designed in the loosest sense possible because it seems like this movie was written over a weekend by a crack team of people who had never played nintendo and directed by a man with less sense of style than my grandmother maybe if the writer and director sat down and actually played some games together they would realize that they were about to film total rubbish and instead go to vocational school to learn how to install car stereosi hope that this has been an enlightening experience for you it sure has not been for me in fact i think i might have lost a few braincells in the act of watching this movie and writing about it next time you are at the video store and you see the the wiz the wizard and the wizard of oz all sitting there on the shelf in a pretty little row give them all a miss and play duck hunt instead,0
70,one of the most boring slashers ever if you can even call it that i would not watch this if it even ended up being some kind of porno movie which it completely resembles the fact that you are watching a small group of middleaged people in the woods is really unbearable they made these kinds of movies for teens so who were they really aiming for when they made this sleepfest my favorite part of this movie is the cover art and it is the only reason i chose to seek out this movie which happened to be part of a suspense classics fifty movie pack and after seeing the other movies in this fifty pack you will realize that it belongs nowhere else so if you are in the mood for a decent slasher in the woods i recommend just before dawn and the final terror,0
71,i was very unimpressed with cinderella two and jungle book two but this is possibly worse than both titles first of all i did not like the animation very saturdaymorningcartoon only worse in some scenes i liked some of the characters namely thunderbolt and patch but the other characters like cruella were mediocre cruella was truly villainous in the original but she lost her quality in the sequel what she said was nothing at all to write home about and her animation was kind of ugly also her artist companion lars was a joke to be honest with you and roger seemed to have quit smoking overnight the voice talents were very good though especially barry bostwick as thunderbolt with the exception of jodi benson the accent ruined it for me there were some good moments but the whole plot seemed bloated for me and highly suggestive of an extended tv episode all in all a hugely disappointing sequel to the most memorable of the sixtys disney movies along with jungle book sorry i can only give this a threeten it just was not my cup of tea bethany cox,0
72,for me this is a story that starts with some funny jokes regarding franks fanatasies when he is travelling with a staircase and when he is sitting in business meetings the problem is that when you have been watching this movie for an hour you will see the same fantasiesfunny situations again and again and again it is to predictable it is more done as a tv story where you can go away and come back without missing anythingi like felix herngren as frank but that is not enough even when it is a comedy it has to have more variations and some kind of message to it is audience,0
73,ruby in paradise is a beautiful comingofage story about a young woman ruby lee gissing escaping her stifling roots to become herself although the title character is played artfully by the gorgeous ashley judd  in likely her first movie role albeit one to be quite proud of  the emphasis is not upon becoming somebody a la the next madonna whether jesus mother or the lurid attentionhungry singerit instead emphasizes following ones instincts and being somewhat introspective about them to grow into ones ideal adult self note this is not an action movie it uses an occasional voiceover narration by ms judd while writing in her journal  and oh i see i have just lost the male half of the readers out there but be patient with this beautiful movie where we learn that ones bliss can be discovered in  oh i do not know carrying water and chopping woodactordirectorwriter todd field who played nick nightingale in eyes wide shut costars as ruby lees noble love interest one who helps her heal her idea of relationships implanted from youthbut not even his character is the answer for ruby lee there is no external hero imposed upon her the ultimate message is that we are responsible for ourselves writerdirector victor nunez who also wrotedirected ulees gold did an amazing job showing a young woman growing into herself  confronting ageold challenges of good v evil along the waythe supporting cast is also stellar and the music used particularly the cuts by chanteuse sam phillips whom i hear is the wife of t bone burnett is right on  most especially trying to hold on to the earth now when i hear the first few chords of that song tears spring to my eyes pavlovian and unbidden  not sure if it is the music or the indelible connection to the movies quiet charming message of empowermentthis movie is highly recommended for any young person trying to find hisher way for any woman of any age it is a must see the downside it is not on dvd except in spanish we learned however that it is legal to make one copy of a vhs version which can be readily found online my beloved husband found someone with a vhs copy and got a dvd copy made for me although this treasure of a movie occasionally pops up onair  on an indie channel usually  you cannot count on that when you might need it most as a tonic to soothe the pressures of the world so buy a copy for yourselfthis movie should have a major rerelease and it would if i were queen of hollywood figgy jones,1
74,this is at least the third remake of this movie so if while watching it there is a sense of deja vu do not be surprised all they did was change the setting of the story and tell it differently but the differences are not significant and it does not get any better because the plot is flawed to begin with it never works and like its predecessors the acting is mediocrethe plot has a unique ending which will surprise any one who has never seen the movie before but the ending does not fit the story had this movie ended ten minutes earlier it would have worked and have been very satisfying and i would have thought it more worthwhile but here is the spoiler and that in the end crime does pay because the criminal is not caught i never like this message resulting from a movie,0
75,at least it is not full of sensless violence or fluff it is also not very full of thought or a smooth storyline this story had some potential but the director appears to have lost site of the green the story is disjointed and goes off in strangedirections to no conclusion i also do not believe the director spent much time around a golf country club either some of the depictions are absurd not very engaging,0
76,who me no i am not kidding that is what it really says on the video caseplot short version pretty woman stands around smiling this for some reason makes all men kill each otherfind arielwhere is arielcannot find ariel she is right behind you you idiotmost of what can be said about this horrendous little space opera has already been said looks likea bunch of corny actors playing mostly convicts come in after the first selection of actors is knocked off very quickly then they get knocked off in the same way every scene is broadcast nearly fifteen minutes in advance perhaps it was a drawing of straws to see which actors had the most screen time and bigger pay check the alien virushologramvr witchglitch seems physically powerless and does not do a thing why cannot she just stay in the computer instead of doing her teleporting vampire routine actually it would have been more interesting if she had been a vampire or doing more than just standing around looking at people which is all she ever does this is enough to make all the men kill each other go figurethis is not really a space flick there are far more shots of the old western trail one thousand nine hundred and fiftys easy rider trail film noirs night club scene even a jog on the beach in fantasyland none of which has any real depth or even makes any sense the night club scene is in black and white of course worked with the wizard of oz does not work so well here this is probably a good thing as those few shots they do show of space are depressingly silly you will probably cry during those moments especially upon seeing that swirling space ship which looks about three inches longnothing is felt for any of the characters not because they are convicts or have no personality but because they are in serious need of acting lessons except for billy dee williams who really does look depressed and at a loss probably by being in this workthis is one of those movies that when viewed with friends is going to cause some extremely loud silences especially when the nerd throws out his attempt at comic oneliners including the line about frenchkissing a meteor did i hear that right perhaps notthe original virtual reality girls get killed which means nothing as they are not even real to begin with well the other characters are not either but that is beside the point hahawhat is kind of funny is that the scene that graces the video case is some sort of skullhorroralien looking thing green filter added on top of that to give it more of auhgreen look which is actually the android after he gets killed and ultimately has nothing to do with anything else afootanother odd deal i noticed whenever there is an explosion at least on my cheap dvd copy everything becomes highly pixelated i do not mean a little pixelated i mean huge blocks about onesixteenth the size of the screen wow,0
77,not the most successful television project john cleese ever did strange case has the feel of a first draft that was rushed into production before any revisions could be made there are some silly ideas throughout and even a few clever ones but the story as a whole unfortunately does not add up to mucharthur lowe is a hoot though as dr watson bionic bits and all good lord,1
78,i loved the original scary movie i am a huge fan of parody it is my favorite form of humor it is sometimes regarded as the most intelligent form of humor the wayans boys seemed to grasp that concept perfectly in the original film then temporarily forgot it when making the sequel i think the wayans are a family of comical geniuses alas even geniuses make mistakesthe movie begins with promise i liked the exorcist parody especially the come on out ma gag now that is wayansquality material but other than that i can only think of two other times i laughed one when tori spelling is seduced in the middle of the night by a spirit then becomes clingy and starts talking about marriage with him meanwhile he is saying it was just a booty call that was kind of funny two the save the last dance parody where the cindy character inadvertently beats up a girl while practicing her new moves but even the shortlived giggles are no match for the sidesplitting laughs of the first scary moviethe rest of the movie is pure trash filled with cheap grossout gags jokes from the first movie which were subtle or implied are magnified and overdone for example in scary movie i several innuendos are made to imply that the character ray is gay this was hilarious but in scary movie ii the whole penisstrangulation scene with ray under the bed was mindnumbing and incredibly unfunny this is the pattern of the whole film shock humor alone does not take a movie very far this was a trend in two thousand and two thousand and one unfortunately as much as it pains me to rate a wayans movie so low i have to give this one a two out of ten,0
79,what is wrong with you people if you were not blown away by the action car sequences and jessica simpsons hot body then you are majorly screwed in the head of course the film is not a masterpiece i do not think it was aiming to be it was fun and funny i never watched the show when i was younger i only recently saw one episode and when i watched the movie i felt it had the same kind of atmosphere the movie seats were practically shaking and the car sequences were good because it did not bore me and drag out like some of the scenes in twofast twofurious and jessica simpson is plain hot i just wish they had used her more in the action sequences all in all i had a hell of a time watching this and i would go and see it again soon and i will buy it on dvd people enjoy it for what it is,1
80,this movie was crap with a capital c the opening scene showed promise but that promise was broken shortly after the viewer learns where the plot is goingand the wooden statue morty who was rather creepy in the original film looks plain goofy in this one it was so obviously just a guy in a cheap plastic costume and by the way who else thinks morty is one of the most unscary names on planet earth it ranks right up there with jimmy or fred when it comes to horror value or why not just name the wooden statute henryfreakinkissinger run it is dr kissinger that would be about as scary as mortyand then there is a scene where the hero hits his fathers tombstone witha sledgehammer you might guessa twobyfour someone might venture no he angrily beats his fathers tombstone with a twiga freakin twig but worse than that once the characters walk away the tombstone actually and inexplicably bleeds oh brotherthere is also a native american guy who lives with the main characters grandparents but apparently does nothing except mortymaintenance he perpetuates creepy mortylegends warns those who scoff and even fixes mortys arm when it becomes damaged during a childish prank but for all his respect for and tenderness toward morty does morty give a rats hairy behind nothe movie drags on and eventually several people die in ways that correspond to their worst fears sort of this film is a real yawner do not rent it,0
81,brokedown palace is the story of two best friends alice and darlene who go on a spontaneous trip to thailand and wind up in prison after being caught with planted drugs in their luggage in this way the movie had the potential to turn into a serious and moving film such as return to paradise but instead the movie chose to focus little on the girls situation and more on their friendshipclaire danes and kate beckinsale both turn in excellent performances and the movie is much more about the interplay between them  the suspicion the jealousy the questioning and testing of their friendship and ultimately the sacrifices made in the name of friendship this movie chooses not to delve too deeply into politics or even into the harshness of prison life which is a bit glossed over and focuses more on these friendship issuesthere were some plot holes here and some parts that just did not seem believable or realistic we did not feel the real fear or hopelessness of their situation as well as we might have and we get very little feeling of life outside the prison walls with bill pullman playing the supposedly sleazy lawyer who actually turns out to have a heart of gold in short this should by all rights have been a much darker movie than it wasbut overall i enjoyed it the acting was good the soundtrack was perfect and the storyline had enough twists and turns to stay interesting worth seeing,1
82,man i really find it hard to believe that the wonderful alan ball had anything to do with this mess having seen the first two episodes thus far i think i can safely say this show is not going to be on my must see list it is just got so many things working against itnone of the actors cast are particularly good anna paquin as the lead character sookie is just awful i remember her being better in a lot of other things i have seen her in so maybe it is just the writing she is not really much fun to look at either there are moments where to be honest she looks downright ugly the actor who plays bill is marginally better if only because his character is supposed to be sort of wooden and aloof the other actors do their best but with the cliché characters with difficult to perform accents they are given it is a tough job tara is an absolute misery to watch rutina wesley absolutely murders the accent it is like nails on a chalkboard bad almost as awful is nelsan ellis it is difficult to understand what he is even saying sometimes both his character as well as taras also seem a bit racist to me i do not know having a character say whycome on an hbo show that is not the wire just seems a bit odd rounding out the cast so far are sookies doddering grandmother her sex addict brother and the only bit of genius casting i have seen in william sanderson as the sheriffthe story seems to be meandering towards it is destination at this point with no real worry about keeping the viewer interested the romance stuff is very dark shadowsy although this show ups the camp factor from something like those old dark shadows episodes times about ten at times it seemed so campy to me that i just have to assume it was intended to be but unlike a show such as buffy that pulled camp off masterfully this show does not out of place with the campiness is the extreme gore and graphic sex of the show i am not averse to either of these when they are done well as they have in many other hbo shows but here at least they prolonged rough sex scenes involving jason stackhouse seem a bit over the top and pointlessabout the only nice thing i can really think to say about this mess is that i liked the opening title sequence hbo has had a string of bad luck with their shows lately i hope they cancel this after the first season and try to get something better on the air,0
83,i love this movie jouvet arletty blier carné almost everything has already been said about the movie but there is one detail i would like to she would some light onto no footage of the real still standing hôtel du nord is it still i heard it was to be demolished has been used for the movie  the whole scene has been rebuilt on set the main reason being that they could not stop the traffic on the st martin canal for several weeks,1
84,presque rien is a story of two young boys falling in love during summer stay by the seaside i do not want to tell the plot because it is not what is most important about this film but you can be sure that it is interesting and original the best part of this movie is the cinematography the visual side of presque rien is so amazing it deserves highest note it leaves you charmed with its beautyas for the plot it is shown in uneven rather complicated way there is no simple chronology nor there are answers to all the questions the film brings but this is what makes presque rien even more interesting i recommend this movie to all the people for whom the artistic side of films is very important and they will not be disappointed,1
85,films such as chocolat beau travail and others have propelled french director claire denis into the top echelon of the worlds most unique and accomplished filmmakers and her two thousand and four film the intruder lintrus adds to the depth of her portfolio a cinematic poem that conveys a mood of abiding loneliness and loss the film provides a glimpse into the psyche of a man who is deteriorating physically and mentally and who travels to various parts of the globe seeking redemption and peace but finds it hard to come by loosely based on jeanluc nancys memoir of a heart transplant the intruder is a film of such unrelenting opaqueness that even after two viewings it is difficult to describe it in other than subjective impressionistic termslouis trebor michael subor is a man in his seventies who is likely dying of a heart condition and who like the professor in ingmar bergmans wild strawberries attempts to come to terms with the mistakes of his life while he has time it is clear that he is physically rugged and very wealthy but seems emotionally drained and the look on his face is one of quiet resignation though we see only one episode of violence where he gets out of bed in the middle of night to kill an intruder there is a sinister sense about him he might be an intelligence officer a foreign agent or a hit manwhatever the case he apparently is under some kind of surveillance and acts like a man that has been involved in criminal wrongdoing and is only now able to see the consequences facial closeups throughout the movie create a strong sense of isolation he lives with his dogs in a cabin in the jura mountains near the frenchswiss border and has an estranged son sidney gregoire collin whom he has long neglected sidney lives nearby with his wife antoinette florence loiretcaille and their two children in one telling scene he meets up with his father on the street and calls him a lunatic but that does not prevent him from taking his moneywhen the film opens we meet antoinette a swiss border guard who boards a van with a trained dog to sniff out some contraband when she comes home she is greeted by her husband who asks her with tongueincheek if she has anything to declare other than these three individuals the people and circumstances we see during the rest of the film may exist only in louis imagination louis has three women in his life and we meet them all in the films first half hour a pharmacist bambou who prepares his medication a neighbor béatrice dalle who is a dog breeder who refuses to care for his dogs when he goes away on a trip telling him that they are as crazy as he is and a young russian organ dealer katia golubeva who he tells he wants a young mans heartrelentlessly she stalks him throughout the film but it is apparently only in his mind in the last section of the film louis travels to south korea in search of a heart transplant and to tahiti to deliver a gift to a different son one whom he has not seen for many years or perhaps has never seen his heart transplant however appears to be a metaphor for a man without a heart a man whose life has been fascinating but ultimately directionless intruding into other peoples lives with little real empathy the intruder contains a haunting guitar soundtrack by stuart staples of the band tindersticks reminiscent of the guitar riff in jim jarmuschs dead man and gorgeous cinematography by denis regular agnes godardgodard creates memorable images that convey a mood of longing and regret a heart beating alone in the snow an infant in a sling looking up at his father for a good two minutes the babys expression gradually turning from morose to a half smile colored streamers blowing from a newly christened ship a massage in a dark room by a mysterious korean masseuse and the vast expanse of ocean seen from a bobbing ship deck while the intruder can be frustrating because of its elliptical nature denis forces us to respond out of our own experience to understand the images on the screen on a very personal level if there is any theme a hint might be found in the opening that tells us what is revealed piecemeal in the film  your worst enemies are hiding in the shadow in your heart,1
86,i have watched this movie twice and i plan to see it again it is the movie that puts you in the directors place regarding his romantic relations and the political situation in israel it also makes me cry because of remembering the wonderful time it was and the horrible murder described there it is really worth watching,1
87,not your typical vamp story not bram stoker or anne rice here a truly original vampyre story these vampyres are genetic mutants who the sunlight do not bother they are pure evil to the film is not perfect many of the actors are clearly amateurs the two leads who play van helsing and rally the vampyre chick are pretty good though the film is intensely violent which may disturb some people also it is loaded with scientific detail that many will find hard to understand and may get bored with i was sold on the clever storyline and the couple good performances no telling how successful this film could be if they had a bigger budget and it got mass distribution,0
88,it sounds as if it should be a biography of claude monet but it is actually a highly focused story of relationships between three adolescent girls on a french synchronized swimming team there are no parents or teachers to speak of no school and boys are represented by one peripheral figure the hunky francois who enters the story determined from time to time and always leaves confusedpauline aquart is the youngest of the three only aspiring to join the team she so much admires she is kind of odd looking she is not yet out of her adolescent growth spurt and has long bony limbs big feet and no derriere to speak of she is prognathous and sports these plump pursed lips after a while her appearance grows on you and from certain angles she can come to appear enthrallingadele haenel is older  more well more developed physically what a glamorous figure she cuts in her swim suit sauntering around teasing the boys swishing her long blond hair but she is not what she seems or is she i could not quite figure it out the french are long on paradoxes and short on consistency no wonder francois is always sniffing after herthere is not so much ambiguity in louse blacheres character she is on the team too but she is dumpy and plain and sensitive about it and has an intense crush on francois blachere is a good actress and adds to the ungainliness of the character through her performancethe movie deals with the relationships between these three meaning intrigues deceptions hidden feelings and all the rest of what we associate with young girls who spend much time with one another this is of course a tricky topic it becomes trickier during the gradual development of a homoerotic relationship between pauline and adele not that you should expect this to be a soft porn movie the only nudity we see is considerably less than a turn on and what little sex there is under the covers sometimes literallyi do not think i want to get into the plot or into its analysis too much partly because it is suggestive rather than expressed through action partly because it is complex and partly because i am not sure i got it alllet me give an example okay adele is the girl the others envy she is also quite distant and self satisfied on top of that she is apparently schtupping every boy and man in sight if they can be of any use to her at all from the handsome but dumb francois to the bus driver she wants a favor from she brags unashamedly about her expertise in fellatio when pauline approaches her about joining the swim team adele uses her as a lookout during assignations with the guys a superior and selfindulgent narcissist you know but then the soidisant slut takes the skinny pauline under her wing and reveals to pauline that she is still a virgin really yes really pauline begins to draw closer to adele and adele finally confesses that she would like to rid herself of her hymen and she would like pauline to do it for her pauline now drawn sexually to adele performs the task with subdued relish now adele would really like to get it on with a man preferably older and experienced so she takes pauline to a boite where she dances seductively with some guy until she follows pauline to the powder room the two girls stand there staring at one another neither having overtly expressed a sexually tinged interest in the other but adele stands so close that pauline slowly loosens her own reins reaches up and kisses adele on the lips adele steps back smiling and says there now that was not so bad was it and then walks back into the clubthat is a pretty close description of whatever is going on between pauline and adele  but what the hell is going on initially adele treats pauline like an irrelevant child later like a close friend finally like a potential lover  and the minute pauline responds adele walks off satisfied is she using pauline the way she seems to be using men does it satisfy adele to know that she now has another person in involuntary servitude i do not knowi have slighted louise blachere as the third member of the trio the plain and overripe wallflower whose expression always suggests dumbfoundedness but who at least is thoroughly heterosexual and the first of the three to rid herself of that noisome virginity but i have only skipped her for considerations of spaceshould you see it by all means just compare it to the typical american movie about high school kids for men some of whom have never penetrated the female mystique this may give you some idea of what it looks like in medium shot,1
89,nay sayers of this film are likely bitter from some seriously unrequited love this is a great film for anyone capable of understanding johnny mathiss song or any song from that era bobby darins beyond the sea or stan getzs the girl from ipanema et ali measure films by how many times i have to watch them before i am satisfied chances are had me back a few good timesi also watch the synergy between the cast i thought they worked well togetheropen your heart and let the comedic magic of film transport youalan,1
90,you can tell they spent five making thisit is a waste of your time ugh there is not anything remotely good about this movie  i do not know why i kept watching it the chick is not hot horrid acting you could do anything and its a better use of your time like watching tv playing shitty video games i feel robbed simply robbed of my time  i have never made a review for a movie before as you can probably tell but this movie i felt like i needed to save the poor souls that are about to watch it and looking on imdb before to see if its decent and looking at the comments there was no action no hot chicks no budget shittttttttttttttty acting it screams bad movie the whole movie is in a room,0
91,hard to categorize the film  perhaps it is an avant garde spy thriller mother night is a very good vonnegut novel and most certainly one of his easiest novels to adapt into a feature length film the film adaptation is very faithful to the original book the indie approach to how this film was produced is probably more effective than having a big hollywood studio financing it these days i doubt an intelligent novel like mother night would ever get the green light from the big hollywood grindhouses and normally that is too bad but not in this case mother night has tight direction and a solid cast nick nolte who seems to be getting better roles as he gets older still has that everyman persona that allows him to take on a wide range of different characters sheryl lee is beautiful and great as always i always thought she deserved better than she got out of the entertainment industry i guess making your debut as a dead girl twin peakswith little air time is not the choicest of roles even if the tv show becomes a minor phenomenon anyway this film is totally enjoyable and you do not have to read the book to understand the movie in fact given todays geopolitical realities the novels premise may appear dated and some younger viewers with little knowledge of history will be utterly confused by the events unfolding i am talking to you fellow americans who are students and scoring the lowest in the industrialized world in geography history and lord knows what other subjects,1
92,after perusing the large amount of comments on this movie it is clear that there are two kinds of science fiction moviegoers there are the ones who are well read extremely literate and intelligent they know the history of the genre and more importantly they know to what heights it can reach in the hands of a gifted author for many years science fiction languished in the basement of literature considered my most critic to be little more than stories of ray guns and aliens meant for prepubescent teenagers todays well read fan knows well this history and knows the great authors asimov heinlein bradbury and ellison who helped bring science fiction out of that basement in doing so they created thought provoking intelligent stories that stretched the boundaries and redefined the human condition this well informed fans are critical of anything hollywood throws at them they are not critical for it is own sake but look upon each offering with a skeptical eye as they should as hollywoods record has been less than stellar to these fans the story must take supreme importance they cannot be fooled by flashy computer graphics and non stop action sequences when the emperor has no clothes they scream it the loudestthe second type of science fiction movie goer has little knowledge about the written aspect of the genre look at many of the above comments that state well i have not read the book or anything by this author their total exposure to science fiction is from movies or the scifi channel they are extremely uncritical willing to overlook huge plot holes weak premises and thin story lines if they are given a healthy dose of wiz bang action and awesome special effects they are in effect willing to turn off their critical thinking skills or maybe they never had them for the duration of the movie case in point i robot while supposedly based on asimovs short stories and named after one of his novels it contains little of what asimov wrote and even less of what he tried to tell us about humanity and our robotic creations those of you that will run out and buy i robot will be very much surprisedthis movie is not even based on that story at all the film has enormous plot holes that at some points are stretched to the limits of credulity i will not point them out i will not spoon feed you you need to practice you thinking skills and discover them for yourself the characters which are named after many of asimovs characters do not possess the critical intelligence that was a hallmark of his stories the plot itself with all it is action sequences goes against everything that the author stood for his belief that humanity possesses the capacity to solve problems using their minds not their fists is vital to understanding his vision of the future in short other than the name their is very little of isaac in anything about this movie there will always be those uncritical ie unthinking who will state the movie does not have to be like the book due to the medium movies sometimes require that changes be made but what about a case where the movie never even tried to stay close to the book or books from the start what if all they took from the written work was the title this begs the question why tarnish a great body of work by slapping it is title on your vacuous piece of crap save money and do not buy the rights to the works title it something else do not use the characters names believe me no one will accuse you of plagiarism in fact it will not matter what you title it to the unread moviegoer who accepts everything you throw at him but it will upset those who read who think who are unwilling to simply let you give them a pretty light show i robot like much of hollywoods take on the genre pushes science fiction back down into that basement it lived in years ago hollywood could not do this alone it takes an uncritical mindless audience that will accept puerile dredge like this,0
93,this film was really eyeopening i have seen this film several times first when i was four and i actually remembered it and then when i was twelve the whole message that the director is conveying is for everyone to wake up and not make the mistake of leaving god out of our everyday lives or just plain going the extra mile to insult hima great movie for nonbelievers and believers alike,1
94,a film without conscience drifter agrees to kill a man for a mobster for money then they double cross him meanwhile he falls in love with the dead mans wife and without her knowing he is the killer moves in with her then he accidentally kills her when she finds out then in a walking tall kind of heroism he gets revenge on the mobsters who double crossed him the first problem is that by agreeing to take on the murder by hire assignment the drifter loses all sense of sympathy worthiness and heroism we cannot accept any goodness in him and as a result the rest of the has no moral center we just cannot care about that kind of guy and the wife nicely played by the fetching kari wuhrer  the sheriff in eight legged freaks a high class lady who runs a mission for homeless people similarly loses a degree of sympathy by jumping right into bed with the homeless drifter despite her evidently weakened state after the death of her husband and when she finds out he is the guy  what does she do she locks him inside her house as if all houses had locks you cannot open from inside with her and proceeds to berate him stoopid george wendt however is terrific in a role as a beefy thug director stuart gordon did so much better with reanimator and dagon,0
95,twenty years ago the five years old boy michael hawthorne witnessed his father killing his mother with an axe in an empty road and committing suicide later on the present days michael gordon currie invites his girlfriend peg stacy grant and his best friends chris myc agnew jennifer emmanuelle vaugier lisa ann kelly benson ned brendon beiser mitch maldive phillip rhys and trish rachel hayward to spend the halloween in the country with his grandparents in their farm he asks his friends to wear costumes that would represent their greatest innermost fear and together with his indian friend crow byron chief moon they would perform an ancient indian celebration using the carved wooden dummy morty jon fedele that would eliminate their fears forever the greatest fear of michael is to become a serial killer like his father but something goes wrong and morty turns into his father killing his friendsthe fear resurrection is a disappointing and pointless slash movie that uses the interesting concept of eliminating the greatest innermost fear of each friend before it grows but in a messy screenplay full of clichés there are some exaggerated performances like for example ms betsy palmer others very weak but in general the acting is good unfortunately there is no explanation why the dummy is brought to live further in spite of being surrounded by close friends the group does not feel pain or sorrow when each one of them dies the lowpace along more than fifty minutes could have been used to built a better dramatic situation in the very end michael shows a charm that his father was interested that i have not noticed along the story i do not know whether the previous reference was edited in the dvd released in brazil with eightyseven minutes running time the special effects are very reasonable for a bmovie my vote is fourtitle brazil fear two uma noite de halloween fear two one night of halloween,0
96,there have been some low moments in my life when i have been bewildered and depressed sitting through rancid aluminium was one of thesethe warning signs were there no premiere even the stars did not want to attend and no reviews in magazines the only reason i sat through the film was in the hope that i might catch up on some sleepnothing in the film was explained the narration was idiotic i cheered at one point when the lead of the film appeared to have been shot then to my growing despair it was revealed that he had not really been shot dampening my joy i sincerely hope all involved in the film are hanged for this atrocity there were some positive aspects mainly unintentional moments of humour for example the scene in which the main character for some unknown reason feels the need to relieve himself manually in a toilet cubicle while telling the person in the next cubicle to put his fingers in his earsmy words cannot explain the anger i feel so i shall conclude thusrancid aluminium for sadists wastrels and regressives only who want to torture themselves,0
97,i saw this movie about five years ago and the memory of it still haunts me to this day i was fully aware at how awful it was supposed to be going into it so i have only myself to blame but like most i did not believe all the negativity being a sandler fan it just seemed inconceivable one of his movies could really be that bad i figured it was just sandler haters i could not have been more wrongwhat we have here is a comedy that does not contain even one second of anything funny that is actually quite an accomplish you would think in a ninety minute comedy they might have accidentally stumbled upon something even remotely amusing but no it is just horrible it is not so bad it is good its just bad you cannot laugh at how bad it is you can only cry you wait patiently for a joke that will at least make you chuckle but they never comehave you seen the movie the ring where the people watch a video tape and die seven days later if this movie was on the video tape people would die instantly by their own hand and there would be smile on their face as they realize their agony has ended and that would be the first smile since they pressed playyou might be inclined to watch it just to see how bad it is unable to curb your curiosity do not please do not trust me i am doing you a favor there are two types of people in the world those that think going overboard is the worst movie ever made and those that have not yet seen it,0
98,most war films made in the us during wwii were great fun to watch but suffered from severe gaps in realism because they were being produced more for propaganda value to raise the spirits at home than anything else i am not knocking these films as many of them are still very watchable however because they so often lack realism they are prevented from being truly great films a perfect example was the john garfield film air forcein which a bseventeen nearly singlehandedly takes out half the japanese air force however pride of the marines is a welcome departurescoring high marks for portraying a true story in a reasonably accurate manner when i first saw this film i thought it was not a true story as it seemed way too improbable to be true however after researching further i found that it was in fact rather true to the amazing story of two men who did so much to earn the medal of honor this is one case where real life seemed too incredible to be true,1
99,i discovered this film after reading the book that inspired it it is not a strictly biographical film it is loosely based on the facts but i found it a compelling and eerie exploration of evil and madness and michel serrault gives an unforgettable performance as dr petiotthere are many memorable images in this movie petiot traveling through the night like a vampire his black cloak flapping behind him is almost iconic there are also several touches of expressionism  petiots crooked silhouette mounting the stairs leading from the cellar where the butchered remains of his victims await cremation reminds me of some scenes from nosferatubut i found the primary appeal of this movie to be aural the soundtrack is loaded with ominous sounds starting with the foreboding music of the opening credits accompanied by wordless wailing petiot lives and runs his medical practice in a complex with many small shops and there is a persistent background noise of knives being sharpened somewhere as well as a peddler playing eerie tunes on a saw there are animal noises as well  the concierge keeps a goat unseen cats howl  and later in the film we see hapless cattle being herded through an underpass the whole atmosphere is unsettling with overtones of violence and slaughternot only animals but human voices are often heard  the screams of gestapo victims petiots patients in his waiting room monitored by a listening device just the same as the suspected collaborators after the war are monitored in their cells even the action of the film is often arranged so that we hear the voices of the participants without seeing them  when petiot goes to see mme kern we hear her singing as she works her voice echoing in the theater before we ever see her and even when she does appear she is often filmed from behind her voice calling out to her husband whose voice calls out to her in conversation disembodied voices echo in large halls and their owners when seen at all are photographed at a distance so we cannot actually see them speaking this is a ghost story and these are the voices of ghosts  many of them petiots future victimsyet petiot himself is often only a voice his frightening laughter echoes as he retreats from the camera throwing comments behind him or into the air to nobody in a way he is as much a ghost as those he murders he is always frantically busy scurrying from appointment to appointment never at rest but his activity is that of a machine  lifeless and imperturbable it is interesting that among all the horror and danger of occupied paris petiot alone is unafraid he is amused enthusiastic angry irritated contemptuous but never afraid unlike those real people he lures to their deaths it is no surprise that he boasts of his mechanical inventions including a perpetual motion machine a true detail from the book  he did claim to have invented many machines he is a sort of perpetual motion machine himself and mechanical imagery is everywhere in the film from the opening giant wheel in the movie house to petiots bicycle with its squeaking wheels echoing the sound of sharpening knives to the victrola he keeps winding up to play music before he makes a kill even his routine with his victims is mechanical  write a note to your wife let me disguise you before you leave you need a vaccination barcelona casablanca dakar  like a welloiled machine the routine is always the same just as the record is always the samemaeder the author says that it was the clockwork perfection of his crimes that weighed so heavily against petiot at his trial his system was as smooth and efficient as a nazi concentration camp and this may be why the movie invents a subplot of petiots involvement with the french gestapo and the occupying nazis unfortunately it does not quite work as part of the story because it is very hard to figure out just what petiot is doing for the collaborators or what is going on when he ends up at their headquarters in the middle of the night disposing of bodies hiding stolen goods it is hard to say and harder to believe it is not likely the state would turn to a freelancer like petiotbut it does remind us of the duality of evil people petiot is a robber and a murderer but he is also a devoted father and husband just as we learned that hitler loved dogs and that nazis guilty of the worst war crimes could also be loving fathers and family men so we have to recognize that petiot could commit unspeakable horrors and yet also function normally his insanity is easily camouflaged by the insanity and horror of the wartime situation in paris when killing robbing and disappearing are happening all around nobody pays attention as petiot tosses more corpses on the pile,1
100,there is no artistic value in this movie to deserve any award well it does not deserve an audience as well ironically one of the awards is for cinematography but frankly the camera movements are disconcerting to say the least every frame you feel you are getting the full picture its like someone is cropping your view from the edges the story is pathetic well i will be honest i could not bear to watch the entire movie the part that sucked the most was when i saw the soldiers partying in their barracks and one of the soldiers coaxed to drink liquor these and many other similar scenes reminded me so much of steven seagaltake my advice stay away from this piece of crap,0
101,the prerequisite for making such a film is a complete ignorance of nietzches work and personality psychoanalytical techniques and viennas history take a wellknow genius you have not read describe him as demented include crazy physicians to cure him a couple of somewhat good looking women have his role played by an actor with an enormous mustache have every character speak with the strongest accent show ridiculous dreams include another prestigious figure who has nothing to do with the first one freud mention a few words used in the genius works overdo everything you can particularly music and you are done audience please stay away,0
102,i happen to be the directors nephew it is taken me years to get my hands on a copy of this film and i can confirm that it is indeed one of the worst movies of all time my uncle does not even have a copy of it anymore i asked i am looking forward to bringing him a copycurrently the films average rating is onenineten as far as i can tell that should put it somewhere in the midthirtys in the imdb bottom one hundred however with only two hundred and six votes it has not yet placedit is sad that the film does not even get the respect of a bottom one hundred titleanyhow i am giving copies of the movie to family members this year for holiday gifts bestworst gift ever,0
103,while originally reluctant to jump on the bandwagon of watching lost i accidentally caught one episode at the beginning of season onethe one with the polarbearand it has had my undivided attention ever since the show that is not the polar bear so bear heh with me while i throw out as much rambling semicoherent praise as i can musterlost takes a simple idea of a passenger flight full of people crashing onto a desert island and gradually adds extraordinary depth to its premise by exploring each character deeply and unflinchinglywhat drives them who are they where did they come from it soon becomes clear that the island upon which they are stranded acts as a common denominator for many things in their lives whether they are running away from something sawyer and kate among others or getting in touch with spirituality locke claire but lost also zooms in on the island itself and the mysterious horrors that it houses and they all seem to be strangely connectedwhile television actors are not exactly known for their subtlety or dazzling acting abilities most of the cast of lost are in truth spectacular actors for their respective parts projecting heart and humour in their performances there is also a multitude of eyecandy but not generally of the plastic hollywood kind as most tv shows the characters all feel very real and they are extremely compelling to watch their interactions rarely fall prey to predictable sappiness petty arguments or cheesy melodrama although they are annoyingly secretive  these people are first and foremost trying to survive and whatever relationship appears is treated secondary to action the realism of these characters facilitate an already wellsculptured plot about this plot imagine a tree as the template plot then the branches as subplots in this case one branch for every character  well lost adds twigs to each branch and then tiny twigs to those twigs as other story lines if you are a brothersister to one of the main characters in the flashbacks you will get your own storyline if you are a dog you will have your own storyline unless the writers manage to weave them all together into some glorious culmination in the end they are setting themselves up i am more than a little worried there will be some disappointing copout to this show as i am sure most people arebut assuming the writers do pull this off lost is possibly the best show ever to hit televisionnineten,1
104,i caught this film late on a sat night sunday morning with my brother we had been drinking this is one of the best films for ripping apart i have ever seen from the luxury ocean liner actually being a roll on roll off ferry complete with cast iron everything to the doors with adhesive stickers saying staff then seeing the same door being used for something else in another scene  this film rocks the continuity is so poor you cannot help but notice it it slaps you in the face with the holes in the final scene he jumps off a life boat with the ferry in the distance cut to his son and new girlfriend the ships pr director who knows kungfu and used to be in the police but was dismissed for doing things her way  trueon the ferry going very fast away from the explosion then the dad is there hugging them how who cares its magic there is not one redeeming feature to this film the casino is the size of a large bedroom with one casino table when being chased by the villains there is only one place to hide you have guessed it enter the villains who instead of checking under the one table proceed to shoot up four fruit machines and a little corner bar a corner bar in the casino  fantastic they walk straight past the only hiding place thus allowing our casper to get around them and take them outget some mates over get a few drinks in put this film on and howl,1
105,murders are occurring in a texas desert town who is responsible slight novelties of mystery and racial tensions the latter really does not fit but otherwise strictly for slasher fans who will appreciate the gore and nudity which are two conventional elements for these filmsdana kimmell of friday the thirteenth part three infamy stars as the bratty quasidetective teenonetwo out of mpaa rated r for violence and gore nudity and some language,0
106,although it is an r rated movie i really doubt that you will really enjoy it unless you are a teenagerwhy because there is no real plot no character developmentno funny jokes the only thing that this movie has plenty of is nudity tons and tons of naked or almost naked chicks pretty nice ones i might add to feast your eyes oni really cannot understand why this movie has the american pie title since it is only a bad combination between an erotic movie and a comedy without succeeding in being either of themmy suggestion is to watch this movie only if you want to see some naked chicks but you are too shy to rentbuy an erotic movie gave it oneten for the two smiles i had in the entire movie and another twoten for the nice chicks,0
107,another cult strikes again this is not a spoiler because the real ending comes after you research the folks who brought this overlylong pseudoscientific infomercialramthas school of enlightenmentwhen any religionphilosophy needs to hide behind an ozlike screen of deceit i walk away thank ramtha i watched a borrowed copy of this movie on the recommendation of a friendto have wasted precious resources on this newage lobotomizer would have been tragic i can only hope that they truly believe they can walk on water enough to take that guidance to it is logical conclusionin other words walk drownor shut up  as a movieit deserves a strong one on it is entertainment value especially for creating the most dislikable character in film history the photographers roommateeeeeeek if you must see this film borrow it from one of the brainwashed folks who recommended it,0
108,this early adam sandler film could be compared to his life as a comic during the same period in one thousand nine hundred and eightynine his characters constant acknowledgement of his hidden comic genius and frustration regarding humorous material seems to come more from sandler than the script the film is nothing compared to his blockbuster feature films such as big daddy or even the corny billy maddison unfortunately sandler had not yet found a way to express himself in a consistent successful and funny manner when this film was made much like his character the majority of the films jokes come from sandler having conversations with himself usually over his unrecognised comic talent and beating himself up because he is too ugly and cannot get women the film is hard to watch too because it does not treat itself like a real film sandler talks to the camera and the viewers throughout the film often referring to the films low budget or questionable content the film is ultimately awkward and embarrassing to watch i immediately wanted to forget i even saw this film after it was over for fear that if more found out about it it would ruin sandlers career pass this one up at the video store i rented it for free and it was still a waste of time,0
109,anyone who actually had the ability to sit through this movie and walk away feeling like it was a good film does not appreciate quality movies this movie was an insult to watch the direction was high school film class quality as well as the cinematography the blair witch project had better cinematography and i hate that move with a passion the storyline had the potential to be a very intense very good movie but it fell flat from the first ten minutes through the rest of the movie someone mentioned that this film was about a childs imagination okay that is all good and fine but they still could have done better things with this script than what they did i mean come on the indian in the store did the kid look at the little idol and suddenly imagine the indian and the entire story about an indian spirit called wendigo which they mention to the store employee and she casually says there is no one but me that works here so you think okay creepy ghost scenario but then she just barters for the amount on the idol and we forget about the little kid seeing this guy that was so lame it goes beyond pathetic the ending left you wondering not only what happened to otis in the hospital but also with the feeling of omg why the hell did i just waste my time watching this this is a move that i recommend not to watch there are definitely better quality films out there that will not insult your intelligence thank god i never had to pay to see this movie i would have demanded my money back for those that were easily entertained by this movie it is very sad that you lowered your standards to this level of film making to actually say that it was a good movie,0

111,if you loved deep cover you might like this film as well many of the poetic interludes fishburne recites in deep cover are from the lyrical script of once in the life a screen adaptation of a play that fishburne wrote if you love larry as much as i do you will love this film that is all larry all hot and all fleshed out of course there is gun play and illicit substance use this is a gangster movie of sorts after all but the script is beautiful and the story is touching even a little on the chick flick sideamazing filmdark frightening sexy and exciting if you ever sneaked out at night or hung out in a clubhouse you will get the proper impact of the cramped sets metephorically echoing being trapped in the life full of clever foreshadowing and complex relationships this film is tightevery sentiment mirrored in the set dressing and camera shots good work,1

113,because of all the negative reviews of this film i almost did not watch it however i was pleasantly surprised that it was a fairly enjoyable horror movie the acting was not great  apart from the wonderful alice krige  but some of the dialogue just consider yourself lunch was quite amusingon the whole an above average stephen king effort  seventen,1
114,somewhere out there there must be a list of the all time worst gay films every made ones that have overlong camera shots of the stars sitting and staring pensively into space or ones where they focus unbearably long on kitty kats eating spaghetti this motion sickness picture is a story of a boy and a boy and they live and love and swim and get stuck in grottos and one of them has a depressed mother and another has no mother and they talk and walk and swim and have sex and get drunk and then break up and someone goes to the hospital for eight days and then gets out and there is a lot of fast forward and rewind and there are long pensive shots of one of them looking into space or just sitting and doing nothing i think it is some sort of gimmicky film making technique or maybe it is that the film is so bad they have to fill it up with long wasted shots because otherwise if they had to rely on plot or story the film would be about fourteen minutes do not get me wrong this is about the thirtyth gay film ive watched in the past six months and some of them most of them have been very formulmatic predictable and boring but this is one is really a terrible waste of time the best one so far was beautiful thing so i watched this and after the very first opening shot which lingered and lingered i thought oh no its going to be creative sinny mah but i gave it a chance and watched it and then when it ended i tossed the dvd in the trash sorry i did not like it and if you did sorry if i offend,0
115,if there was anything akira kurosawa did wrong in making dodeskaden it was making it with the partnership he formed with the four knights the other three being kobayaski ichikawa and konishita they wanted a big blockbuster hit to kick off their partnership and instead kurosawa arguably the head cheese of the group delivered an abstract humanist art film with characters living in a decimated slum that had many of its characters face dark tragedies had he made it on a more independent basis or went to another studio who knows but it was because of this among some other financial and creative woes that also contributed to his suicide attempt in one thousand nine hundred and seventyone and yet at the end of the day as an artist kurosawa did not stop delivering what he is infamous for with his dramas the strengths of the human spirit in the face of adversity that its backdrop is a little more unusual than most should not be ignored but it is not at all a fault of kurosawasthe material in dodeskaden is absorbing but not in ways that one usually finds from the director and mostly because it is driven by character instead of plot there is things that happen to these people and kurosawas challenge here is to interweave them into a cohesive whole the character who starts off in the picture oddly enough though thankfully as there is not much room for him to grow is rokkuchan a brain damaged manchild who goes around all day making train sounds the clicketyclack of the title only sometimes stopping to pray for his mother but then we branch off there is the father and son the latter who scrounges restaurants for food and the former who goes on and on with sitespecific descriptions of his dream house an older man has the look of death to him and we learn later on he is lost a lot more than he will tell most people including a woman who has a past with him a shy quiet woman who works in servitude to her adoptive father or uncle i am not sure who rapes her and a meek guy in a suit who has a constant facial tick and a big mean wife to those who are social aroundthere are also little markers of people around these characters like two drunks who keep stumbling around every night like clockwork putting big demands on their spouses sometimes unintentionally swapping them and there is the kind sake salesman on the bike who has a sweet but strange connection with the shy quiet woman and of course there is a group of gossiping ladies who squat around a watering hole in the middle of the slum not having anything too nice to say about anyone unless it is about something erotic with a guy first to note with all of this is how kurosawa sets the picture it is a little postapocalyptic looking not of any particular time or place that is until in a couple of shots we see modern cars and streets it is a marginalized society but the concerns of these people are however in tragic scope meant to be deconstructed through dramatic force like bergman kurosawa is out to dissect the shattered emotions of people with one scene in particular when the deathlylooking man who has hollow sorrowful eyes sits ripping cloth in silence as a woman goes along with itsometimes there is charm and even some laughs to be had with these people i even enjoyed maybe ironically the little moments with rokkuchan specifically with kurosawas cameo as a painter in the street or the awkward silences with the man with the facial tics but while kurosawa allows his actors some room to improvise his camera movements still remain as they have always been patient but alert with wide compositions and claustrophobic shots painterly visions and faces sometimes with the stylization of a silent drama meant as a weeper amid these sometimes bizarre and touching stories with some of them ie the father and son in the car especially sad kurosawa lights his film and designs the color scheme as his first one in eastmancolor like it is one of his paintings lush sprawling spilling at times over the seams but always with some control this place is not necessarily lighter it is like the abstract has come fullthrottle into the scene where things look vibrant but are much darker underneath it is a brilliant tricky doubleedged sword that allows for the dreamlike intonations with such heavy duty dramawith a sweet movie score toru takemitsu also responsible for ran and some excellent performances from the actors and a few indelible scenes in a whole fantastic career dodeskaden is in its own way a minor work from the director but nonetheless near perfect on its own terms which as with many kurosawa dramas like ikiru and red beard holds hard truths on the human condition without too much sentimentality,1
116,as a pokémon fan i enjoyed this movie very much it introduces new legendary pokémon as each movie does and adds depth to the relationships between its characters i however do not expect those who are not pokémon fans to enjoy itthis includes most adults some of the lines were corny but that can be somewhat unavoidable when dubbing the movie over to english the animation was beautiful although there were a couple parts that did not look good and although the villain is kind of corny i think that the movies have done a good job of cycling through different types of villains and i guarantee you that they are not all like this one those who did not like it i say to each his own but pokémon fans will love it,1
117,what happens when an army of wetbacks towelheads and godless eastern european commies gather their forces south of the border gary busey kicks their butts of course another laughable example of reaganera cultural fallout bulletproof wastes a decent supporting cast headed by l q jones and thalmus rasulala,0
118,this is the definite lars von trier movie my favorite i rank it higher than breaking the waves or the latest dancer in the dark i simply love the beauty of the picturethe framing is so original acting is wonderful a must see,1
119,i think the comments regarding the show being cheesy are a bit too exaggerated when a person comes to watch a tv show what does he look out for it is to enjoy that he watches a show unless heshe is a critic or a person who analyzes story but most of us are not so and watch the shows to relax and enjoy full house is an ideal show to watch after having a heavy day in the officeschool it makes you laugh and it is not just humoryes the tanner family is a perfect family a perfectly hypothetical family if any such family existed in real world it would be a role model for us to follow but this is a tv show and not a real family and there is nothing wrong in depicting a hypothetical family on television the very fact that the show could run so long shows us that people enjoyed watching it whatever be the comments later onanother good point about the show is that any person of any age would not only enjoy watching it but would take back a message however childish that message be those jesses talks with michelle are extremely touching if one does not think of it as childishoverall i would say after watching every show of full house there is a contentment in your heart that is rarely present after many other shows,1
120,having been forced by my children to watch this at least ten times for each of the last two christmases i feel adequately qualified to pass judgment on this version of dr seuss classic tale and well it is not very good first off following a classic act like chuck jones animated tv special is going to be difficult for anyone but this interpretation is so heavyhanded and padded as to be positively numbing i will concede that there are a handful of inspired gags but overall the film comes off as a calculated cash grab at the same time as it is supposedly decrying the commercialisation of christmas jim carrey is typically over the top here but that is completely at odds with the character of the grinch as characterised by boris karloff he was a slow burn methodical and sly there is no method to carreys madness and that is only the most obvious error made talented actors like jeffrey tambor and christine baranski are utterly wasted here why universal why i mean  i understand that tony hopkins will take just about any role offered much like his countryman michael caine but this one needs to be filed under films that should never have been made this does not bode well for the cat in the hat an even thinner tome that universal is prepping for this christmas i get the feeling that i will be making the same recommendation for that one as i am with this one skip it and either read the book or watch the tv special this is two hours you can never ever get back,0
121,not only was this the most expensive canadian film ever shot in because but easily the worst never seeing the light of day the director is not even canadian but british and boy does it show we are all made out to be a bunch of oversexed dope fiends and morons the spirit of what it means to be canadian is absent and this is supposed to be the reason we fund this bunk of course the british character is normal the rest are a crop of sitcom stereotype  can you say norm the cinematography ranges from pretty postcard images to murky indoor silhouettes the actors always seem to be fidgetting are they as bored as the viewer or is this the directors idea of cinema avoid this mess and check out some of bruce mcdonalds films a true canadian boy with something original to say cinematically you will not be compelled to walk out on his films after ten minutes,0
122,this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen i saw it at the premiere at sxsw and was extremely disappointed the director knew little about john lennon and even said as much at the premiere this is a drama but people were laughing throughout at how cheesy the film was that is never a good sign the only saving graces were dominic monaghan and jason leonard as liviens roommatesbandmates they were funny while the rest of the movie took itself waaay too seriously the cheesy dropping of beatles lyrics was just absurd the soundtrack was excellent however and was probably the best part of the movie unless you are one of those crazy rabid dominic monaghan fans do not bother with this one,0
123,fear of a black hat is a superbly crafted film i was laughing almost continuously from start to finish if you have the means i highly recommend viewing this movie it is by far the funniest movie i have had the pleasure to experience grab your stuff,1
124,why on earth should you explore the mesmerizing nature documentary earth how much time do you have on earth so i can explain this to you ok i will not elongate my review exploration on earth to infinity but i must stand my ground on why this is a must see the documentary takes a nature round trip on the migration paths on three animal families a female polar bear and her cubs with the real life subplot of the father bear daring it out to hunt for food in his isolated path a mama of a whale with her baby whale taking a whale of a migration tour for prey and an elephant mama with her small maybe not so small they are elephants offspring migrating in africa directors alastair forthegill  mark linfield did an out of this earth job in also capturing the survival skills of many other animal species besides the magnetic shots of our three animal family protagonists the cinematographically skilled team of richard brooks burton mike holding adam ravetch and andrew shillabeer were animales in camera shooting the wondrous nature sites and animal instinctive behaviors not to mention the slomo animal prey shots were you n b e l i e a v a b l e earth is also a lesson learner on the global warming effect on the animals the papa polar bear in the doc is the poster animal boy on that consequence so fellow earthlings it is time to take the documentary voyage to visit earth today  good,1
125,the romance of the movie which is also its main theme is good and nicely presented however the surrounding of the love story is too lyric graphical and unrealistic even worse the psychology of the main character is weird and incomprehensible exactly like the end of the movie do not hesitate to watch this movie if it attracted your interest but do not expect too much of it either,1
126,i´m not surprised that even cowgirls get the blues if this movie is anything to go by i expected something better from uma thurman which was the reason i suffered my way through this experience in the first place an awful film with only the music as a redeeming quality it´s just a shame that we are incapable of giving zero out of ten in these reviews this movie deserves it,0
127,this is a bit long two hours twenty minutes but it had a a lot of the famous pearl buck novel in it in other words a lot of ground to coverit was soapoperish at times but had some visually dramatic moments too capped off by a locust attack at the end of the film that was astounding to view considering this film is about seventy years old the specialeffects crew on this film did a spectacular jobpaul muni and luise rainer were awardwinning actors in their day and they do not disappoint here both giving powerful performances the only problem is credibility as all the asians are played by caucasions and some of them like walter connolly just do not look real i would like to see a remake of this movie with allasian actors not for pc reasons but to simply make the story look and sound more credible,1
128,thomas clay has been mixing with the wrong types that is the trouble with young people these days they have no respectseriously this film should be avoided at all costs the action in the main body of the film is slow and rather stodgy and ambles to the drug crazed ending as if like it is director it has no where better to go we are introduced to the main title character who is a bit of an outsider we see him at school and at home not quite fitting in feeling awkward in himself as so many adolescents do robert falls in with bad lads and starts missing school and taking drugs and before you know it he is a psycho rapistthe film is really about clays total failure to understand the links between violence imagery and violent acts clay seems to think a generation of crazed youth are made evil by scenes of war on our tvs yet he has filmed the most disgusting piece of simulated violence is this guy for realif clay has not seen youtube perhaps he is naive and unaware of will be done with the brutal climax scene from his film all anyone will want to see is the most hideous scene from the end of the film and i am sure that will be what sticks with people the rest of the film is pointless for in committing such an act of violence to film clay not only damns young people who are actively engaged in preventing war he also damns himself as perpetrator of extreme tasteless violence for no better reason than his own personal celebrity statusshame on all involved,0
129,emily watsons natalia is absolutely the most loving and romantic lead character i have ever seen on a screen she is the queen of this film beyond all doubt or is she transmuted to the king the internecine weaving of the chess games and the families struggles for control power and victory is stunning just as the chess masters in the film do the director is playing many simultaneous games with our mind at once but all weave into either major or minor patterns the period the costumes and imagery of early twentyth century italys lake district is captured magnificently not a single square of space is wastedso many brilliant scenes abound i cannot recount them all i recommend budgeting enough time to watch this movie twice possibly a week apart because you cannot possibly capture all the poetry within a sixtyfoursquare yet multidimensional framework in one setting i did not read nabakovs book but to try an analogy of my own what i am reading reminds of me of another romantically triumphant poetryasgame movie barry levinsons the natural it totally jettisoned the downbeat ending of bernard malamuds fatalistic book in favor of a romantic impressionism that was uniquely american well the director did that one better by seamlessly meshing russian and italian morals and mores as a backdrop to enlightenment the true story here is that games are zerosum there is a winner and a loser unless both contestants draw but in life and especially in the context of our immortal souls we are only limited by those constraints and lifes conventions to the extent we let others break our spirit pure love as personified by emily watsons natalia can transcend and allow all of us to be enhanced by its gifts simultaneously only the barriers erected by our fears can cut us off from itthis is a magnificent movie tenten,1
130,this apology for a movie is about absolutely nothing rachel griffiths must have needed the money the film must have been made on a very low budget because the lighting was non existent i made a vow if i ever see pete postlesumthingor other i will commit suicide i would be happy to know if there was one a plot or twoa script my biggest regret is i wasted my time watching this rubbish,0
131,can you say all shock no plot there were so many unexplored directions in this movie there was no history about the room other than the deaths why was it evil what made it that way why an hour countdown then there were the unexplored things hinted at for example we saw a camera in the air vent which he mentioned but when he climbed up said vent there was no camerahow about the fact that all the ghosts looked digital and things winked out before hitting the ground making a static noise hmmm when you put all of those things together it makes room one thousand four hundred and eight look like a hightech spook house except that there was no follow up on thatoh by the way electronics do not work in one thousand four hundred and eight well except for the tv the cell phone has no signal but wireless internet works fine how many incontinuities can you possibly add i am sorry but this film was nothing but shock after shock it is all been done before reflections in the mirror things just out of site changing paintings bleeding walls the oh it was all just a dream no it was not and if the room was evil why make our main character come to terms with his daughters death if it was going to keep him trapped there forever anyway it just did not make senseadditionally there was no background information about the first book that he wrote just some vague information about the dad was a jerk and so forth speaking of dads what was with the bit about his father you will be in my placeoverall a truly horrible movie it was one hundred adrenalin shock factor without any new or innovative effects and certainly no back story character development etcmy overall impression is that the entire movie was made on the cheap pretty much using one set and a couple of location shots and was nothing but an effects film of recycled cheesy seenthatbefore effects,0
132,watched this with my girlfriend after stumbling over it while zaping channelsi guess we both hoped for some kind of happy family cute christmas movie but were extremely disappointedthe actor playing the soldier seems to have zero emotion whatsoever his face looks the same whether he is chopping down christmas trees seeing the girl he loves being kissed by her boyfriend or when he is happily surprised by the girl he loves he is an awful actor and at no pont did any of us do nothing but laugh at himthen there is the cute blond girl blessed with the ability to count dots and cheat on her boyfriend what a catch and her ambition in life is to live with her parents and count more dotsso it is basically a story about a guy without any emotion or feelings who falls for a guy who count dots and cheats on her boyfriend it is as predictable as it gets and really a waste of time you gain nothing by watching this other than some weird laughs because it is all so cornyi love it when her dad says that he only eats french fries and not french wine and they all laugh that is the hillbilly attitude this movie is about furthermore if my girlfriends dad were bossing me around like i would tell him a thing or to but not our army veteran no sir he let us everyone boss him aroundthe movie is what first blood would have been if john rambo were burn like the biggest wimp in the world,0
133,i may very well be one of the few who really stuck to this film i also saw this movie when it came out and i agree with the last post that up the acedemy was way ahead of its time the humor in the film itself is pure mad magazine i do not see why mad stand behind this feature it was also one of the few films of the early eightys to have a killer accompanying soundtrack with the punk and new wave bands that were emerging from la at the time i own the soundtrack and i play it constantly to this day what can i say there are definitely worst movies out there i do not consider porkys to be as funny as up the academy there are some really good laughs throughout the film and the jokes fall on either stereotypes or getting laid hey nobody said this was going to be the maltese falcon,1
134,i am not a john cleese completist although i thought fawlty towers was brilliant but i am a fan and when i saw this sitting neglected on a shelf at my local blockbuster i decided to give it a try what i got was a wonderful surprise and one of the funniest fifty minute viewing experiences i have ever had the writing is typical english goon show schtick in fact as an audio skit this would not be out of place on a firesign theater album but the execution and timing is spot on and this elevates strange case into the kind of jawdropping performance that can create lifelong british comedy fanatics the brits have a gift for combining broadly satirical lampoons with closely observed tics of character and timing and the creators use both to good effect here cleeses portrayal of holmes seems to owe much to the arkins and sellers inspector clouseau however cleese has such a knack for physical comedy that he more than holds his own but the unexpected treat here is arthur lowe who plays watson as an genial but invincibly uncomprehending imbecile with such superb timing and delivery that he becomes the best aspect of the film i would never heard of lowe before this his background seems to be vaudeville and musical theater but he justifies his entire career with this performance as far as i am concernedsome people might not care for strange case especially if british whimsy is not their cuppa tea but i am extremely glad i got to see this before it vanished from sight,1
135,remember the early days of pay per view i do and i can almost remember the number you had to call to actually rent the movie on your tv as a kid we always wanted to rent playboy but this meant actually calling someone from ppv and asking to rent it and then you get the nerve to do it and your watching four hours of soft core no angle crap well the reason i bring that up is because this movie too was on ppv and i remember almost every scene that was in the add i have been on a kick in the last few years to obtain all the great movies i use to see as a kid and this was one of them it is one that when its on its hard to shut off all star cast trying to commit the perfect bank bust but nothing goes right there are plenty of spoof bank capers that are good and this one has to fall in that category it has enough action and laughs to sustain it check it out if you dare,1
136,i mean really this is not going to help the australian film industry to make this kind of film with no values of any kind okay if you are a stoner and have nothing better to do then maybe i think filmmakers from here should try to show the rest of the world what great talented people we have and this is not the vehicle for it come on now this film is just tacky,0
137,first off i never considered myself an uwe boll hater since i think i never even saw one of his movies but after seeing this cheap excuse for a movie named seed which is the name of the serial killer this movie is about i am close to joining the hate club this movie makes absolutely no sense at all the plot is a joke and although boll clearly tries to get attention by shocking people ninety of this movie is just plain boredom you can sum up this movie like this one hooded killer watches clips of animals getting tortured on tv this is real life footage from pelt farms and the movie opens with the ridiculous reason of making a statement about humanity and giving a peta address since this movie has no message at all and is the worst piece of torture pornexploitation you already have a reason to hate the movie from the beginning onwardtwo death by electrocution with a pretext that gives away what happens later in this movie printed on screen so every retard gets itthree cops watch videos of animals babies and women starved to death and decomposing in seeds basement having stupid nightmares and crying into their whiskey because seed is such an evil bad mofo although the acting is ok the movie takes a dive every time it tries to incorporate any emotions four cops bust seed in his house act stupid and get slashed in the dark this sequence reminds me of a video game you barely see anything except flashlights seed is a super killer that is everywhere at once and all cops act stupid enough to be killed except for one who busts himfive seed gets the chair and we see his electrocution as lengthy as everything else in this movie he will not die and we are reminded of the opening statement that he must be set free if he survives three electric jolts guess what they just bury him alive to solve the problemsix seed comes out of his grave kills everyone off in another slashing part and then seeks the main cop to take revenge onseven a woman gets her head bashed in with a hammer in an endless sequence from one point of view just for the fun and shock value of it eight seed captures the cops family lures him to his house threatens to kill his wife and daughter after killing his wife with a nail gun the cop shoots himself in the head considering that is what is seed wants its hard to get into that guys head since he not just wears his mask even in prison but also never utters a word  the movie has barely any dialog anyway so do not mindnine boll goes for a nihilistic shocker end where seed locks the daughter in with her dead dad to rot like the persons we saw on video on sequence threethis is it no message no plot no reason no face behind the mask no background except a stupid story that seed was burnt as a childthis movie relies purely on few key scenes and their shock value i hardly remember a movie this empty of any emotion or message or entertainment its like watching august underground  that is fine with me some people will enjoy this brainless snuff but what is really hard to stand about it is the pseudomessage in the beginning and the fact that the movie is well made considering camerawork effects and even the acting is too good for this waste of celluloid so how does boll get money to make such movies when thousands of talented directors work on shoestring budgets seed is not just the essence of ridiculous its living proof that the free market is flawed  lucky uwe that the german taxpayer is paying for a lot of this waste to get deductments,0
138,john carpenters halloween is quite frankly a horror masterpiece it tells the immortal story of escaped mental patient michael myers who returns to his hometown on halloween night to stalk and kill a group of babysittersthis was the first and without doubt the best in the halloween franchise carpenter shows great restraint in pacing the story very slowly and building likable characters unusual for a horror pictureeven more unusual is the nonexistence of blood and gore and yet it remains the scariest halloween to date get that halloween marked the film debut of jamie lee curtis and a defining point in the late great donald pleasances career a true classic,1
139,as i was watching this film on video last night i kept getting these tingles that told me this one will endure i have a feeling i will be watching this again and again for years to comeit is got all the timeless qualities you could ask for in a storyfilm and even though some cultural references are obscure for me a western viewer at the core this is a universal tale,1
140,disowned by richard c sarafian this disaster stunk up japanese theaters before coming to the states and going immediately to video where it was not seen again until the turner networks needed something other than infomercials to fill their threeamsixam time slots and found this tape at the bottom of their bin the smithee name is supposed to be used when the studio hacks the movie so badly that the director no longer wants his name attached to it but i am afraid that sarafian can not blame the studio entirely on this one the actors mostly recent graduates of overacting one hundred and one deliver one cornball line after another the plot is convoluted the special effects are unimpressive the parts that are not laughable are just plain boring the script or the book must have been good  why else would palance matheson boyle or heston agree to appear in this dud but something went horribly wrong from the page to the screen summary avoid not even bad enough to be sobadit isgood,0
141,in the classic sense of the four humors which are not specific to the concept of funny or even entertainment altmans health treats all of the humors and actually in very funny entertaining ways there is the phlegm as personified by lauren bacalls very slow guarded and protective character esther brill who is mission in life appears to be all about appearance protecting the secrets of her age and beauty more than her wellbeing there is paul dooleys choleric dr gil gainey who like a fish out of water perhaps more like a seal flops around frenetically barking and exhorting the crowds to subscribe to his aquatic madness the melancholy of glenda jacksons isabella garnell smacks of shakespeares troubled and selfrighteous hamlet  even proffering a soliloquy or two and let us not forget henry gibsons bile character bobby hammer the breast that feeds the baby rules the world then there is the characters harry wolff and gloria burbank james garner and carol burnett respectively relatively sane characters striving to find some kind of balance amongst all the companion and extreme humors who have convened for health  a kind of world trade organization specializing in health which is to say anything but health this is altman at his classic best,1
142,i was on france around march five and i love to go to this film festivals i knew about this cinémas damérique latine de toulouse but i have never went to it i decided to go and then i caught cero y van four the film is stunning it does not caused the impact on me like with the mexican users because it was frenchsubtitled but it is still shockingthis film is a satire about urban violence about kidnapping and crime on the streets in mexico it is a crude portrait of the city of a metropolis secuestro express with a stunning mia maestro which was also a satire of kidnapping almost but with a more serious tone has and i think so some kind of connection with cero y van four a sort of redemption story and that how much is too much man on fire that was stunningly strong was also not a satire but a crude portrait into the streets of mexico or it is like the brave one a film that shocks and hits you in the guts very hard this is like the usual suspects it has some plot twists and turns but that makes it even more believable verdict a film that shocks and makes you believe that there is no security on the streets anymore stunning dialogue impressive direction and astonishing performances cero y van four is a film that you will not forget soon leaves you shaking and stunned,1
143,the most misogynistic movie of all time not to mention by sixtyeight should not they have moved beyond white people in brown face playing the indians my favorite parts though have to be when the girls giggle and blush as the bikers drag them off to gang rape them rape is fun who knew let us see then there is the blatant ripoffs of the hustler fat boss character actually plays pool while scheming to destroy the indians with the lead rebel dude the horrific acting the soonthenosetheymightaswellhavejusttoldyouwhattothink music cues the lack of anyone who is actually indian in this movie and who are we supposed to be rooting for i have to say it figures that quentin tarantino loves this movie even though his movies tend to champion strong women i have heard from at least one source that in real life he is a misogynistic idiot why did i watch it you ask do not ask,0
144,spoilersin the words of jeanpaul sartre hell is other people in the odd couple jack lemmon and walter matthau demonstrate just how accurate this can be as felix ungar and oscar madison lemmon and matthau respectively create two good friends who decide to live together as the two begin to slowly grow more and more frustrated with each other the laughs come thick and fast before felix departs leaving oscar a changed and more cleanly individualjack lemmon as ungar is absolutely superb as the neurotic cleaning obsessed divorcee coping with life as a single man walter matthau in contrast to lemmons character is equally as good as the slobbish sports writer who simply wants to play poker to earn money for his child benefitslemmon and matthau are magnificant in their selected parts to some degree dependent upon the beautiful script by neil simon and simultaneously because they work well as a team as two friends who are inherently different in lifestyles although similar in relationships with exwives and children these two late great actors create a partnership which is practically impossible to recreate so great in fact that the world screamed out so much for something similar that two years before matthaus death and three before lemmons the characters were reunited in an inferior sequel this idea whilst following hollywoods irritating obsession with sequels might have worked to a certain degree but at the same time it could never come close to replicating the genius of this original filmultimately it is not really possible to say anything else with simons amazing script filled with humour and laughter the creators of this film were already onto a hit the casting of jack lemmon and walter matthau as felix ungar and oscar madison though is the most important part of this film the odd couple with it is traditional soundtrack which even gained a tribute in the simpsons it is excellent script and it is genius leading men is a tribute to cinema and a feature for history to remember,1
145,first off  there is absolutely no flirting going on in this film  with anthony or anyone else these people do not flirt  they just do it your first test of endurance is to wade through more than fifteen minutes of intense violence and sexual perversion this would not be so bad  hell i like violence and perversion as much as the next reviewer but without a context to put it in it is repellent so you make it through the torture and mayhem then we meet donna and the movie turns into something all together different  not better  just different a road picture without heart there are lame attempts at comedy thanks to cameos  broadly written and broadly played by broads like judy tenuta and mink stole and a few hookers and drag queens too they all deserve better the photography is purposely disorienting so if you get motion sickness or really any kind of sickness  this flick is not for you come to think of it i am not sure just who this flick is for except maybe gay and bisexual sm fans who like poorly scripted poorly shot indy films about themselves,0
146,what an incredible fall for sean ellisyou gather a bunch of your friends at home all hyped about the follow up work of sean ellis you have an vague idea of the plot no spoilers that could kill the fun very high expectationsit is late at night perfect atmosphere for a movie of this typefifteenminutes passes and you start telling yourself it is bound to pick up at twentyfivemins you start wondering if you should just go to sleep and save this for another time when you can fully appreciate the expected not existent subtle touches over the half hour mark you realize half of your your hyped up audience is already asleep and call it a daya few days later when you exhaust all other material to watch you go back to this in the middle of the day this time hoping your mood will keep you awake this time ten minutes later you find yourself fastforwarding the unbelievably and needlessly long intermediate transitions and images any other stuff i would have given up already but there is cashback and its legacy but that legacy can only carry you so long this is a new level of boring moviemaking imagine a short story extended to a novel with just descriptions this is what it isdecent cast is wasted there is no cinematography that leaves you in awe like cashback either there are films that annoy you there are films that lack certain aspects or just cheesy unfortunately this is just a waste of timefinal words stay away,0
147,this is possibly one of the worst movies i have ever seen i do not care what the critics say it is bad i think the problem is with kunderas novel it is not that it is unfilmable it is just that like ninetynine of his work it is pretentious and overdrawn he seems to be enamored with himselfhis characters come off as navelgazing and his novels as a whole are misogynistic i have read many of his works even his socialist realist poetry that was truly awful  i just do not understand what the fuss is about characteristics like the selfabsorption in his novels make for infuriating reading in a movie all the things that i dislike about kundera were magnified maybe i just missed something but i do not think so on a side note i cannot believe that this is a criterion collection dvd no way is this movie that essential,0
148,there are many kinds of reunion shows one kind is where old actors are taken out of mothballs and set to recreate characters they have not played for twenty or thirty years these have mixed results return to mayberry despite some silliness was okay return to green acres as execrable eddie albert used a word for the script i will not repeat here but both it and the movie stink rescue from gilligans island filled in a necessary gap in the story of the castaways though the show itself was silly even from a gilligans island viewpoint in most cases the scripts are weak sometimes a silliness appears in the scripts that is too knowing  and in comedy it is nearly always fatal for the characters to know they are being funny new characters are introduced who do not fit the mix in the main these reunion shows are pretty weak a second sort of reunion show is the kind where the cast lays its past aside but sits around telling stories reminiscing interspersed with flashbacks from the shows then there are movies based on the shows which are rarely good and movies based on the history of the show the brady bunch has had both of these happen to it with various resultsreturn to the batcave uses nearly all the above with a wonderfully twisted viewpoint which makes it the best of the reunion shows and has raised the bar for the othersadam west and burt ward and summoned to a showing of the original batmobile while they are there the car is stolen the adam west of the movie is a man demented he called jerry his butler alfred he opens a bust of shakespeare in his apartment and reveals a hidden pole to slide down to the parking garage he is obsessed with being a crime fighter when in fact he is merely a washed up actor when the batmobile is stolen he not only believes it is his duty as a crime fighter to recover it he drags and unwilling burt ward in as his assistantthe pursuit is largely loquacious with west and ward reminiscing about the old days it is broken by flashbacks with actors playing west and ward in the old days the modern scenes and the flashbacks both have the wacky lack of reality the show maintained there are also running gags that show west is able to make fun of himself in wards book about his time on the show he spoke frankly about wests libido and also his being a skinflint west makes ward pay for everything in their pursuit down to tips and bus fare the clues they follow the characters they meet even in flashback all fit the mentality of the old series and there are several homages including a fist fight with written sound effectsthe whole thing is extremely funny and done with great panache there are also cameos by julie newmar looking like she is had one facelift too many and frank gorshin reminding us why he has such a cult following gorshin will be the riddler when jim carey his obvious successor is long forgotten the movie builds to a fairly obvious but funny climaxthis show is a model for reunion shows  unfortunately there are few that can fit the pattern this show had actors replaying their old characters young actors playing a movie about the making of the show the actors west and ward reminiscing and a modernday movie with the real adam west playing the demented adam west it has everything if you loved the old show this is the stopper on the bottle,1
149,i gave timecop a perfect ten i gave this oneits story is very boring and it has only little to do with the original timecop lots of things from timecop was scrapped and they put in new stupid stuff instead this story is taking place in two thousand and sixty if i remember correctly but for some reason the timetraveling is now more dangerous confusedand the action scenes are nothing to be happy about well most of them are not only the first one is great and there are not many action scenes at all and they are all pretty shortat one point in the story the main character travels through time about five times within a few minutes no wait make that two timesin short do not waste time watching this movie it is not worth it,0
150,this seems like one of those movies that we think we should like but i did not it seemed to be trying way too hard to be artsy all flash with no content it has some beautiful scenes and any one of them are nice to watch but tack them all together and it becomes an arduous task just to sit through it i rented this because of the glowing reviews on the video carton and the fact that i am a big shakespeare fan but i was very disappointed i just found it a bit pretentious and at times boring,0
151,after harry reems teenage girlfriend is raped by zebbedy colt the nightwalker reems becomes despondent and consoles himself by having sex with some lesbians meanwhile colt who carries a cane and dresses like a magician rapes some more women eventually reems decides to track him down and end his crime spree despite being shot on film and marginally nasty it looks like any other seventys porno and is ineptly executed the rapeabuse scenes are surprisingly restrained and the attempt to cash in on death wish is laughable r bolla cannibal holocaust plays a cop colt who is usually overthetop wigs out in a couple of scenes but he is too well behaved for my money this roughie could have been much rougher,0
152,dooohhh my bwainn hurrrts well it certainly does after this endurance test of a film how on earth i managed to keep going without hitting the fast forward button lord only knows maybe it is memaybe i do not get the premise of the film or maybe i do not appreciate it is alleged mystical atmosphere in my humble opinion though the film has about as much mystical atmosphere as a trip to mcdonaldsin addition the characters were all dreadful and there is more character development in a tom  jerry cartoon yaarrrghhh why do i do it why do i watch such tripe it is enough to make one run away and join a monastery or the foreign legion yaargh an absolutley dreadful film in just about every respect apart from that it is not to bad,0
153,this is a really good film and one that i have enjoyed watching several times michael caines awesome as always michael caine has received kind of a reputation for taking any role in any movie no matter what the quality or lack of same but he does a good turn in playing sidney from the start it is so well written who would have thought that ira levin who wrote such creepy stuff as the boys from brazil and rosemarys baby could write something this witty let us face it  michael caine chris reeve dyan cannon henry jones how are you going to go wrong with a cast this good directed by sidney lumeti am really reticent to go on because if anyone were to give away anything about this film it would be a crime just watch it and adore it,1
154,oh dear me rarely has a horror film bored me or made me laugh as much as this one after a spirited start with an intriguing premise it descends into not much more than a slasher flick with some supernatural and sexual asides the usually excellent alice krige is wasted in this one and the plot twists are ludicrous do not bother unless you are really desperate rating threeten,0
155,i watched this movie when joe bob briggs hosted monstervision on tnt even he could not make this movie enjoyable the only reason i watched it until the end is because i teach video production and i wanted to make sure my students never made anything this bad  but it took all my intestinal fortitude to sit through it though it is like watching your great grandmother flirting with a fifteen year old boy  excruciatingly painfulif you took the actual film dipped it in paint thinner then watched it it would be more entertaining seriouslyif you see this movie in the bargin bin at smart back away from it as if it were a rattlesnake,0
156,ok i would not normally watch a farrelly brothers movie i cannot recall ever watching one i also do not recall watching a jimmy fallon movie alright i did watch taxi but i said penance and was forgiven for that mistake but this movie had drew barrymore and i just think she is the cutest thing i do not know what it is about her but i just smile the whole time i am watch her she just captivates me that way i mean i even watched adam sandler just to see her in fifty first dates how sad is that this was not the greatest baseball movie  it was not supposed to be it was a love story about a sad puppy that hung on to the only thing that never let him down until he found something worth giving that up for it had a predictable ending but there was so much on the way there that made it worthwhile,1
157,embarrassingly i just watched this movie for the first time thirteen years after its release it is a story that any father or brother can relate to one brother is a bit wild the other brother is the typical older child craig sheffer is a little too unemotional as the oldest brother but pitt is amazing and skerritt is perfectly cast as the father the fishing scenes that were filmed in montana are absolutely breathtaking i had no idea that fly fishing could be so attractive the movie closely follows the book with only a few modifications to make it more appropriate for a movie format unlike most book to movie stories this one measures up it is a perfect movie for anyone who wants a quiet night with a powerful and somewhat emotional movie,1
158,this has the funnist jokes out of all the cheech  chong flicks it is the first one i saw with these guys i found it to be really good my dad actually recommended me to get it what a great role model and my grandma actually bought it for me knowing what it was like what a family i have well this movie is pretty good and great to rent when you want to see a good classic i must warn you though this is not gutbusting funny it has its moments but not as funny as there is something about mary check it out anyway i am sure you will laugh unless your an antidrug activist or something,1
159,waste of my life  the director should be embarrassed why people feel they need to make worthless movies will never make sense to me when she died at the end it made me laugh i had to change the channel many times throughout the film because i was getting embarrassed watching such poor acting hopefully the guy who played heath never gets work again on top of that i hope the director never gets to make another film and has his paycheck taken back for this crap  two out of ten ,0
160,this film is quite boring there are snippets of naked flesh tossed around in a lame attempt to keep the viewer awake but they do not succeedthe best thing about the movie is lena olinshe does a masterful job handling her character but daylewis garbles most of his lineskaufman clearly had no idea how to film this the incongruities in bouncing between domestic householdmarriage issues and political crises are badly matched character attitudes change without explanation throughout badly disjointed,0
161,i did not approach still crazy with any real anticipation just another rocknroll picture i figured good nostalgia for the baby boomers this film is partially that but so much more brian gibson the director previously helmed a biography of tina turner and is quite successful in his style i suppose it is fitting that this was his last filmthe cast is wellchosen bill nighy is perfect in his role as the bands frontman actorturneddirector bruce robinson appears as the bands washedup guitarist he does a superb job even though he has not appeared on film since the late seventys if you are looking for an touching and funny film with some great songs you have found itsevenfour out of ten,1
162,i was given the book version of kazaam for my eightth birthday and people always say the book versions are always better than the movie but this time they were wrong at least with the movie it is over soonthe acting in this is terrible which i expected from a film with shaq who plays a magical rapping genie that comes out of an old ghetto blaster which there was probably a good reason he was trapped in there the kid in the film that plays max is whiny and a terrible actor he is bullied by neighborhood kids which i do not blame them because he is a little douche bagthe story is just plain stupid and extremely cliché about a boy who is father is always working and never around who finds a new friend who makes his life better and eventually helps him reconnect with his fathereven at eight years old i thought this was a stupid idea it is a surprise any of the people whom worked on this film had careers after wards because it is an embarrassment and should have never been made i could ramble on even more about how this movie sucks but you should already know just by reading the plot,0
163,an awful film it must have been up against some real stinkers to be nominated for the golden globe they have taken the story of the first famous female renaissance painter and mangled it beyond recognition my complaint is not that they have taken liberties with the facts if the story were good that would perfectly fine but it is simply bizarre  by all accounts the true story of this artist would have made for a far better film so why did they come up with this dishwaterdull script i suppose there were not enough naked people in the factual version it is hurriedly capped off in the end with a summary of the artists life  we could have saved ourselves a couple of hours if they would favored the rest of the film with same brevity,0
164,in factit is basically the same movieand they could not even get the time line of events correctmaybe that was intentional due to laziness or not caringeither waythis thing is a real wooferit does not even deserved to be called a moviei viewed this as a so called second feature on the disc containing the original the boogeymani thought my head would explodeand i urge you to run as far in the opposite direction of this thingif you should be cursed with the misfortune of combing across it is pathit should come with a warning label likewarningmay cause your iq to drop several points if you are within it is vicinityfor methere is no doubt this thing is a zeroten,0
165,this is according to me a quite bizarre movie with a lot of humor in it i would not say that it is very scary but more fun i guess that is if you like horror movies scarecrow kind of remembered me of children of the corn but still not if you compare these two movies this is much more fun to watch ,1
166,ok ok do not get bent out of round i was kiddingbustin out is actually a better and truer title anyhooracism and crime dramas get the satiric treat meant from our xrated animator friend ralphie boy and he does one of his better jobs hereon the crime front it shows the truth they build it defend it then boredom and stronger rivals because them to maybe lose it see for yourself to see what goes downracist i do not know with scatman rip and the love walrus also rip being black and the main point of view i saw it as an attack on racism mostly the fact that richard pryor liked it says as much as well and the younger pre miami vice phil mike thomas in there was a nice surpriseit is an animated blacksploitation film that is a good thing done well and well done it will make some squirm like the lynching scene but unfortunately that is based on factbut ralphie really should have rethought that title,1
167,i finally caught up to starlight last night on television and all i can say is   wow it is hard to know where to begin  the incredibly hokey special effects check out the laser beams shooting out of willies eyes the atrocious acting the ponderous dialogue the mismatched use of stock footage or the air of earnest pretentiousness that infuses the entire production this truly is a oneofakind experience and we should all be thankful for that i nominate jonathon kay as the true heir to ed wood,0
168,what can i say i ignored the reviews and went to see it myself damn the reviews were so right what a waste of money considering it is budgetgood thing i went to see kill bill after this oneto see a really scary movie would be crossroadsbottom line i like girl in gold boots better than this crap,0
169,i completely agree with jamromfour this was the single most horrible movie i have ever seen holy crap it was terrible i was warned not to see itand foolishly i watched it anyway about ten minutes into the painful experience i completely gave up on watching the atrocitybut sat through until the endjust to see if i could well i did and now i wish i had notit was disgustingnothing happened and the ending was all preachyno movie that bad has the right to survivei implore all of you to spare yourself the terror of fatty drives the busif only i had heeded the same warningplease save yourself from this moviei have a feeling those who rated it highly were involved in the making of the movieand should all be wiped off the face of the planet,0
170,this is my favorite movie ever i have watched it at least ten times and i cry every time my family begs me not to watch it so i will not have a crying fit i think i love that it is a true story written by antwone himself just as much as i love the movie the acting is top notch and the actors were perfect for their role denzel washington is one of my favorite actors but this is my favorite movie he has done so far i took care of a little boy who was also born in jail he was the most precious little boy i had ever met he has now been adopted by a wonderful family who fought for him for almost two years i saw this movie while the fight was still going on and his future was unsure and i am so happy he is safe and loved and i am so happy antwones happy and found his familyi would love to know more about him and how it has been since meeting his family i just cannot say enough good things about it,1
171,i have never been a fan of farrah fawcettuntil now she was truly amazing in this movie the emotion she must have gone through shooting retake after retake does not bare thinking about this was a very hard movie to watch the subject matter is decidedly unpleasant and you feel so helpless just sitting and watching a woman being abused for what seems like an eternity i actually felt that the whole thing deflated somewhat when her friends returned to the house and i did not find the conclusion at all plausible the director seemed very keen in using height in his shots and loved using mirror reflections i believe he should have paid more attention to the pace in the second half of this piece i am sure this makes a heck of a powerful piece of theatre this movie for me although it had merit just fell short,1
172,do not even waste your time let alone pay rental for this piece of dreck how it got made is beyond me i do not know why there is a minimum of ten lines i have already summarized this trashy movie but oh well the acting was awful like they all needed lessons the plot was weak the ending feh i think the cinematography was the only thing that did not totally suck well maybe the sound was minimalistically ok the one good thing is if they could make this movie even make some money with it there may be hope for any screenwriter with a real idea so youall take heart i guess the same holds true of actors if these people actually got paid then you can too,0
173,potential spoilersman this movie was awful a catholicsuperstitioussuspense thriller it goes over already well tread ground from previous moviesthe doubting priest sex and the priesthood politics and religion church hypocrisy conspiracy involving the church the dawn of a new evil age all kinds of dark magic voodoo battles between good and evilpretty stupid and lame with a weak storyline to suffice the story revolves around two concepts absolution better known as the sacrament of anointing the sick  the last rights a person can ask for to cleanse ones sins while on the brink of death and excommunication the act of cutting a person off from the church basically an excommunicated person cannot receive absolution thus comes in the sin eater and i will leave it at that throw in all the dopy things i already listed and you have the orderi found the sex scene with the priest interlaced with shots of a picture of the virgin mary rather insulting to catholics it also ends with heath ledger saying i paraphrase i am the redeemer and damner of sins i live on without love blah blah blah cue him walking in dark alley with long trench coat alla the matrixi gave this movie a one for not only being crappy and unoriginal but also because it managed to insult an entire faith in the process if you want to see something better i suggest the prophecy with christopher walken,0
174,hah so this is the movie that the next action stars were getting into well i am glad that i did not participate and did not winis not it funny how one can just look at the first ten seconds and make up ones mind about a movie i mean come on just look at those titles i watched this movieor part of this teleplay since it was produced for tv and we could not bear to watch the whole thing one evening while doing my military service and the audience with me was the typical hodgepodge of average guys that once in a while watch series like las vegas just for the girls in the show so the bar was not really high the most watched movie in my group was girl next door and it was not because of the great script d  but this movies total lack of originality acting scripting and just about everything else that makes a movie good made it pretty easy to switch channel to las vegas or was it csi do not remember without any complaints by the rest of the group and that is rare for heavens sake do not by this movie if it is on tv then yes watch it and contemplate on it my conclusion well since joel silver has indeed produced some of the best actionfilms out there die hard matrix one to name some i can only say that producers do not give the film it is quality they provide money for the directors and to sell this movie just because it is a joel silver movie is just a desperate attempt to conceal the obvious flaws of the crew who really made it,0
175,i am afraid that you will find that the huge majority of people who rate this movie as a ten are highly christian i am not if you are looking for a christian movie i recommend this film if you are looking for a good general movie i am afraid you will need to go elsewherei was annoyed by the characters and their illogical behaviour the premise of the movie is that the teaching of morality without teaching that it was jesus who is the basis of morality is itself wrong one scene shows the main character telling a boy that it is wrong to steal and then the character goes on to say that it was jesus who taught us this i find that offensive are we to believe that thou shalt not steal came from jesus i suppose he wrote the ten commandments and stealing was acceptable before that i rented the movie from netflix i should have realized the nature of the movie from the comments oh well,0
176,not only is this film entertaining with excellent comedic acting but also interesting politically it was made at the end of the soviet union but makes fun of the soviet mentality through and through the story is set during the early days of the soviet union and it questions the rationale behind the revolution both in cultural and practical terms of course by the late eightys and early ninetys the bizarre strictures of soviet society are already relaxed but the ideology and mentality is still alive and well and ready for some welldeserved deconstruction happily all this deep philosophical commentary is wrapped in a funny and entertaining packagejur,1
177,i loved this film i am a true tom hanks fan and i have always been impressed with all of his work from his most dramatic roles like cast away the green mile saving private ryan forrest gump apollo thirteen  philadelphia to his hilarious roles like a league of their own turner and hooch catch me if you can the lady killers big  of course toy story but in this film hanks is not the only great actor who lights up the screen tyler hoechlin an up and coming star who shows great promise in hollywood co stars as hanks son and delivers nothing short of a great performance he is certainly someone to watch out for over his career i believe he will do great things paul newman as always delivers a brilliant performance on screen he is truly a legend we cannot forget the people who did not have such big roles in the film but still helped make it great the beautiful  very talented jennifer jason leigh who is performance in bastard out of carolina  single white female i will never forget brings her grace to the screen as hanks wife in the film and does a superb job liam aiken is another found treasure in film he does such a great job with such a small role and like his roles in lemony snickets and sweet november and i dreamed of africa he gives a great performance,1
178,the movie is just plain funmaybe more fun for those of us who were young and fans of the ramones around the time the film was made i have watched the film over and over by myself and with friends and it is still fresh and funny at the risk of being too serious the concept of being a big fan of a certain band is timeless and high school students boredom with drudgery of some classes is just as timelessand the film has some gem linesscenesreferences to how our permanent record in high school will follow us through life let me assure you i have been out of high school for uhhh some years and it is not following methe famous static line i am getting some staticnot as much as you are going to get as principal togar approachesthe school board member who is so decrepit he is attended by nursesthe nazi hall monitors love for a body search principal togar announcing i give you the final solution and burning the ramones records note records were what came before cds and of course joey ramone noting things sure have changed since we got kicked out of high school followed by togar asking do your parents know you are ramonesjust one piece of advicedo not look up where the stars are nowjoey ramone sadly died young dey young who was a major hottie in the film today reminds us we all agepj soles career never advanced as we might have expected marla rosenfield as one the other students apparently appeared only in this film one of my male friends dies over her every time we watch the film though i submit her performance was more than adequate and should have brought her more teen film roles and does anyone know what happened to dj don steele so watch and enjoydo not thinkjust have fun,1
179,i liked this show a lot  we got the first and only it would appear series in the uk on channel four the characterisation was right on the money  a bit like the simpsons in that all the different facets of small town populace were representedthere was no laughter track  i had not seen this on an american tv comedy at the time except for on larry sanders and it really worked well here heightening the suggestion that these wacky cops were really like that and not just hamming it up for the camerasall in all a quirky little number that tickled me just right i cannot help but think that maybe it missed it is mark with certain audiences i think it would have been a cult hit in the uk had it been shown at an acceptable houri will round this off with my standard comment where the hell can i get hold of this to watch it again any ideas,1
180,hard to believe perhaps but this film was denounced as immoral from more pulpits than any other film produced prior to the imposition of the bluenose hayes code yes indeed priests actually told their flocks that anyone who went to see this film was thereby committing a mortal sini am not making this up they had several reasons as followsitem jane likes sex she and tarzan are shown waking up one morning in their treetop shelter she stretches sensuously and with a coquettish look she says tarzan you have been a bad boy so they have not only been having sex they have been having kinky sex a few years later under the hays code people especially women were not supposed to be depicted as enjoying sexitem jane prefers a guileless if wise and resourceful savage tarzan to a civilized respectable ninetofive man holt when holt at first wows her with a pretty dress from london she wavers a bit when holt tries to kill tarzan and holt and jane both believe he is dead she wavers a lot but when she realizes her man is very much alive the attractions of civilization vanish for her and why not tarzans and janes relationship is egalitarian he lacks the civilized insecurity that would compel him to assert himself as the head of his wife to boot he lacks many more civilized hangups for example jealousy when holt and his buddy arrive tarzan greets them both cordially knowing perfectly well that holt is janes old flame when holt gets her dolled up in a london dress and is slowdancing with her to a portable phonograph tarzan drops out of a tree and draws his knife jealous nope he is merely cautious toward the weird music machine since he is never seen one before once it is explained he is coolitem civilized holt is dirty minded savage tarzan is innocently sexy as jane slips into holts lamplit tent holt gets off on watching her silhouette as she changes into the fancy dress by contrast after tarzan playfully pulls the dress off kicks her into the swimming hole and dives in after her there follows the most tastefully erotic nude scene in all cinema the pair spends five minutes in a lovely water balletthe scene was filmed in three versionsclothed topless and nudethe scene was cut prior to the films release but the nude version is restored in the video now available and when jane emerges and cheetah the chimp steals her dress just for a tease jane makes it clear that her irritation is only because of the proximity of civilized men and their hangups where is the universal prurience so dear to the hearts of seminarians nowhere that is where another reason why the hung up regarded this film as sinful item the notion that man is the crown of creation and animals are here only for mans use and comfort takes a severe beating holt and his buddy want to be guided to the elephant graveyard so they can scoop up the ivory and take it home they want tarzan to guide them to said graveyard you reader are thinking fat chance and you are right he is shocked he exclaims elephants sleep which to him explains everything jane explains tarzans feelings which the two gentlemen find ridiculous item jane the excivilized woman is far more resourceful than the two civilized men she accompanies holt and buddy blow it and find themselves besieged by hostile tribes and wild animals it is jane who maintains her cool while the boys panic she takes charge barks orders at them and passes out the riflesitem janes costume is a sort of poncho with nothing underneath the original idea was for her to be topless with foliage artistically blocking off her nipples which indeed is the case in one brief scenelastly several men of the cloth complained because the film was called tarzan and his mate rather than tarzan and his wife no commentof course tarzan who has been nursed back to health by his ape friends comes to the rescue routs the white hunters and induces the pack elephants and african bearers to return the ivory they stole to the sacred place whence it came the endso there you have it an utterly subversive film like all the other films about complex and interesting women see eg possessed with rita hayworth and raymond massey which constituted such a flowing genre in the early thirtys and which were brought to such an abrupt end by the adoption of the hays code the joie de vivre of this film is best expressed by janes soprano version of the famous tarzan yell a nice touch which was unfortunately abandoned in future productionslet us hear it for artistic freedom feminist jane and sex,1
181,the brain that would not die was considered so distasteful in one thousand nine hundred and fiftynine that several cuts and the passage of three years was required before it was released in one thousand nine hundred and sixtytwo today it is difficult to imagine how anyone could have taken the thing seriously even in one thousand nine hundred and fiftynine the thing is both lurid and lewd but it is also incredibly ludicrous in a profoundly bumptious sort of waythe story of course concerns a doctor who is an eager experimenter in transplanting limbsand when his girl friend is killed in a car crash he rushes her head to his secret lab with the aid of a few telephone cords a couple of clamps and what looks very like a shallow baking pan he brings her head back to life but is she grateful not hardly in fact she seems mightily ticked off about the whole thing particularly when it transpires that the doctor plans to attach her head to another bodyas it happens the doctor is picky about this new body he wants one built for speed and he takes to cruising disconcerted women on city sidewalks haunting strip joints visiting body beautiful contests and hunting down cheesecake models in search of endowments that will raise his eyebrow but back at the lab the head has developed a chemicallyinduced psychic link with another one of the doctors experiments this one so hideous that it is kept locked out of sight in a handy laboratory closet can they work together to get rid of the bitter and malicious lab assistance wreck revenge upon the doctor and save the woman whose body he hankers for could be leading man jason evers plays the roguish doctor as if he is been given a massive dose of spanish fly virginia leith the unhappy head screeches and cackles in spite of the fact that she has no lungs and maybe not even any vocal chords busty babes gyrate to incredibly tawdry music actors make irrational character changes from line to line the dialogue is even more nonsensical than the plot and you will need a calculator to add up the continuity goofs on the whole the brain that would not die comes off as even more unintentionally funny than an ed wood moviedirector joseph green actually manages to keep the whole thing moving at pretty good clip and looking at the film today it is easy to pick out scenes that influenced later directors who no doubt saw the thing when they were young and impressionable and never quite got over it the cuts made before the film went into release are forever lost but the cuts made for television have been restored in the alpha release and while the film and sound quality are not particularly great it is just as well to recall that they probably were not all that good to begin withnow this is one of those movies that you will either find incredibly dull or wildly hilarious depending on your point of view so it is very hard to give a recommendation but i will say this if your tastes run to the likes of ed wood or russ meyers you need to snap this one up and now four stars for its cheesybizarreness alone gft amazon reviewer,1
182,that magical moment in life that point between the beautiful innocence of childhood and the confusing whirlwind that marks adulthood    this is what this movie is all about danni wonderfully played by reese witherspoon is right at that moment in life when the movie starts she swoons over elvis playing his records and wishfully thinking about love maureen her sister will soon be off to college has no trouble with attracting boys is beautiful and seems to have it all figured out although she does not she dates a local loser who is father is also after her and just wishes she could find a decent boy and be swept off her feet danni like most young teenagers wishes she could be anyone else but herself because most teenagers think that who they are just is not good enough she wants to be maureen but does not see that she is beautiful herselfthe moment adulthood begins to intrude itself upon her life is when she meets court foster for the first time court who is father has recently died has moved to their old farm to work it with his mother and two younger brothers he has been thrust responsibility when he should be having fun on one particular hot day he goes to the pond and jumps in only to find danni skinny dipping they yell and argue and danni leaves but they see each other a day later when courts mother is invited to dannis to visit old friendsdannis parents danni becomes attracted to court and court to danni she is a tomboy and is spunky has attitude and says what is on her mind court is seventeen and danni fourteen and he knows it but they continue to grow closer with their days at the pond between court working the farm by the time court kisses her one day danni is smitten dannis father tells her to invite court to the house and he does but things are uncomfortable for court on his sort of date the silence though is broken by his meeting with maureen who has yet to see court one look between the two and its all over the looks of pain and defeat on dannis face are both beautiful in their trueness to life and painful at the same time the rest of the movie i will not tell but the movie has more to it than a relationship between a boy and two sistersthe greatness of the movie is in its depiction of lifes moments both beautiful and painful and the relationship between two sisters whose love is tested by both a boy that they love and the pain they must endure both together and individually danni eventually marks her entrance into the world when she sees that the world is unfair painful and maybe even a little less hopeful than when the movie started few movies can truly capture the wonder of childhood and the pain of adulthood so perfectly this movie has since the first time i watched it stuck in my mind its in the my top one hundred movie list and deservedly so i only wish more movies like this were made because if so    my faith in hollywood would be a lot better,1
183,emma is my favourite jane austen novel  emma is wellmeaning despite her flaws so readers can forgive and love her and the relationship she has with mr knightley which is warm familiar respectful but playful generating that warm fuzzy romantic excitement mr knightley is the perfect man and emma is as close as you could get in those times to an independent clever confident woman  remember she is only twentyone and was sure to have matured and grown out of her flaws who does not want to be emma who does not want to be told off by mr knightley this version of emma gives you no sense of the things that i love about emma i could not even finish watching it i just found it so awful i could not see that warm generous side of emma which drives the reader to love her the patience and warmth she shows to her father the closeness between her and mrs weston which demonstrates her willingness to put her friends happiness above her own as she sacrifices the only equal companion in her household by forwarding miss taylors marriage mr woodhouses character in this adaptation just appears bizarre rather than just quaint elderly and a bit tryingthis adaptation most importantly fails bring to life the relationship between mr knightley and emma their relationship is built on mutual respect and affection mr knightley is indulgent of emmas minor faults trusting that her intelligence and genuine care for others will never allow her to go terribly astray and emma looks up to him though playfully hiding this and continuing to use her own judgement the dressing down he gives her right at the beginning of the show completely overstates the argument between them and ruins all possibility of portraying the nature of their relationship as i have described above mr knightley is also insufficiently attractive to bring to life the sexual tension between the leads or to inspire any admiration from the female viewersreally horrible i cannot understand why anyone who truly like the novel emma could like it unless it miraculously redeems itself after the point i switched it off,0
184,i tried to like this program i really did i even bought the pilot film first on vhs and later on dvd however i could not get into this story because its two main characters david bruce willis and maddie cybill shepherd just seemed to in love with themselves for one thing i admit was some clever dialog in the shows which was a key part of the success of the tv program and i did appreciate of lot of that dialog basically this was almost like the old screwball comedy movies of the thirtys and fortys with male versus female you get lots of arguing accusations yelling and screaming a lot of people apparently love that sort of bickering but i hate it so i never got on the moonlighting bandwagon only allyce beasley as the hapless aide agnes was entertaining it is too bad she had such little air time shepherd was nice on the eyes and i suppose women would say the same for willis but too much arguing between the two finally turned me off,0
185,this film has been scaring me since the first day i saw itmy mum had watched it when it was on the telly back in ninetytwo i remember being woken up in the middle of the night by her tearful ramblings as my dad helped her up the stairsshe was saying something like do not let her get me or something like that i asked what had made her so upset and she told me that she would been watching the woman in blackso obviously i had to watch it and even though i was only eleven she let me it scared the s out of me i have been immune to horror films since watching this,1
186,this is not so much film as big budget childrens television as far as i can tell the villain is a giant swarm of chocolate covered espresso beans this theory seems to be verified by the fact that the subtitles refer to it as insomnia when it is first mentioned that a civilization had been wiped out by insomnia i thought wow a nihilistic martial arts film but no such luck although you have to consider it experimental cinema when the villain is strangled by an old mans long white eyebrows zu warriors makes exactly the same amount of sense whether the subtitles are on or off that is not a good sign i found the special effects to be somewhere between ray harryhausen and xena warrior princess primitive,0
187,i have always been a great fan of woody allen and always will be for most of what he did in the past but only a blind lover could ignore how dull meaningless pretentious and most of all horrendously acted this movie is a vacuous mental masturbation based on inconsistent grounds and what a disastrous idea to artificially recreate a presumed actor allenclone that is putting into will farrells mouth and gestures what allen would have done in farrells place had he been thirty years younger the outcome was obviously ludicrous and not to speak of the dialogues what was intended to be philosophical reflections turned into an involuntary mockery of intellectual pondering unaware of its comic effect how sad,0
188,this little seen movie is a languid and laidback giallo it veers away from some of the clichés of the genre and adopts a looser approach it is about a woman searching for her missing lover a psychiatrist who has suddenly vanished for no apparent reason her search leads her to a villa populated by a group of eccentric individuals in true giallo style murder is never far awaythe cast is really rather good we have aldofo celi thunderball alida valli suspiria horst frank cat of nine tails and a very young sybil danning eightys scream queen the lead actress is rosemary dexter and while i am not familiar with her she does a good job in leading the pictureone of the defining features of eye in the labyrinth is its music atypically for a giallo it features a jazzrock fusion soundtrack this score composed by roberto nicolosi is reminiscent of miles davis especially his work on in a silent way it is an excellent soundtrack and really gives this movie a different feel than most gialli the fusion groove accentuates the languid atmosphere and compliments the sunny seafront scenery that the film is mostly made up ofthis is a giallo so we really need to talk about the murder setpieces well this film falls a little short in this regard it is certainly not devoid of them but they are few and far between the opening dreammurder being probably the best on offer as well as a memorable burning car sequence but this really is not a particularly violent film still i do not think it should disappoint too many seasoned fans of the genre the mystery is fairly compelling and it has enough eccentric characters the idiot boy saro and that unsettlingly inappropriate dubbed accent and moments of the bizarre to satisfy while the sleazefactor is upheld with a smattering of nudity throughouteye in the labyrinth plays like a giallo version of an agatha christie mystery as it features a group of unsympathetic characters in a villa all under suspicion of murder we have the obligatory flashbacks detailing their connections with the final hours of the highly unsympathetic murder victim while this is not a gradea example of the genre it is certainly an appealingly different one as it does not borrow too heavily from other films of the subgenre for giallo enthusiasts i give this a thumbs up and hope one day it is given a nice dvd transfer it certainly deserves the treatment,1
189,an actors first film is usually something one can afford to miss  it is often that first job where the lack of film experience by everyone involved is truly on display and this film is no exceptionbut worse than that even by one thousand nine hundred and eightytwo standards this is so bad it is hysterically funny filmed entirely in the chicago area on an obviously small budget most of the acting by the entire cast is stiff wooden and cartoonish  a cross between a high school play and bad community theater noise from nearby traffic often drowns out the dialog and the dialog is truly bad very declarative in a way that comes off as forced and expedient rather than natural and organic scenes are contrived and choppy and even though the characters go through a span of years neither the children nor the adults age at alli do believe it is possible to make a christian film that is palatable to a large secular audience but too often the creators of such films are so focused on the message or in this case their own autobiographical ties to the project that good film production values are tossed aside i am sure it is no coincidence that the main character has the same name as the producerdirectoreditor  and cast member luckily michael madsen was much more interesting  and believable  to watch in his subsequent films careers like his are certainly not built on films like this one,0
190,the unborn is a pretty good lowbudget horror movie exploiting the fears associated with pregnancy it is very well acted by the alwaysgood brooke adams and bmovie stalwart james karen although the supporting cast is pretty average for a bgrader the music by gary numan of all people is good too henry dominics script is quite intelligent for this sort of thing although there is a hint of misogyny about it rodman fenders direction is merely adequate and there are some unnecessary cheap scares if you are a fan of adams whose movie career is nowhere near as illustrious as it should be check it out she is great as always,1
191,the bfg is one of roald dahls most cherished books but in this animated adaptation the magic just is not there this version remains pretty faithful to dahls original story so one cannot lay the blame on john hambleys script if anything the fault lies with the colourless animation the lethargic pace and the generally lacklustre voiceovers one would be right to expect this story to make for a happy vibrant funfilled movie instead the film is a hopelessly dull affair that becomes quite tedious to watch children who are not familiar with the story should definitely read the book first all the film will achieve is to put them off read what is actually a childrens classicyoung orphan sophie voice of amanda root lives in a nonetoofriendly orphanage under the cruel supervision of mrs clonkers one evening she is peering through the window when she spots a massive figure walking stealthily down the village street the figure realises it has been seen so it reaches in through the window and scoops sophie from her bed placing her into its enormous pocket before fleeing into the night sophie soon discovers that she has been kidnapped by a giant from giant country and fears that he will eat her but to her relief he turns out to be a kind and sensitive member of his species who introduces himself as the bfg voice of david jason the bfg refuses to eat people instead restricting himself to foultasting vegetables known as snozzcumbers however giant country is populated by numerous other giants who do feast  every night as it happens  on poor unsuspecting humans sophie and the bfg become great friends and soon they come up with a plan to thwart the other giants together they go to the queen of england voice of angela thorne with their remarkable story and beg her to send the army and the air force to fight the maneating giants the queen agrees and so begins a dangerous operation to capture the bad giants before they can harm anyone elsejason voices the bfg quite well one of the few pluses in the film but his good work is almost ruined by somewhat poor sound quality the rest of the voice work is decidedly uninspired with very little to bring the characters to life similarly the bfg is the only character that is imaginatively animated  sophie lacks appeal and the giants are boringly designed and look almost indistinguishable from each other even the places are uninventive giant country especially comes up short being nothing more than a barren wasteland with occasional rocks and canyons at eightyeight minutes the film is not exactly lengthy yet it drags quite badly in parts due to the soporific handling of several sequences little of dahls mischievous humour is conveyed satisfactorily one chapter in the book deals with the bfgs love of whizzpopping farting and is laughoutloud hilarious in the film the same section is totally killed by unfunny handling i came to the the bfg expecting lots of zest fun and enjoyment but what i got was pretty much the opposite this one is a failed misfire that simply does not match the calibre of the book in any department  unfortunately therefore it must go down as one to skip,0
192,what a crimeyou forgot to brush your teethlet us make a thirty minute show about it and have a couple of kids make some noise and then have the dad lecture them all because that is what he has to dobut do not forget uncle joey has to make some weird noises and cooky faces then uncle jesse has to show up with his black leather jacket and some jeans and look pretty for a few minutes while everybody discusses how mother would have done things if she were aroundyep full of zany little adventures about a whole bunch of nothing and an entire overlong story to build around itfull house will not only bore you to tears but it will make you age twenty times faster than you normally would,0
193,this is one a most famous movies of the french sexual empowerment of the seventies starring gerard depardieu and patrick dewaere in extremely sarcastic roles it is also one of the many dark psychological dramas of the seventieseighties such as serie noire buffet froid beau pere all realized by blierhowever i would like to correct the previous comment that was posted on the movie the translated title in english is very far from the french version it is true that both protagonists are going places but the title in french could be literally translated by the waltz dancers which is a metaphor for the movement of the testicles,1
194,beautiful to watch but what would be the first thing you would do the moment you discovered atlantis explore it here was a golden opportunity to take viewers someplace special instead disney reverted to the same old formula story telling,1
195,this was the worst movie i have ever seen yet it was also the best movie sci fi original movies are supposed to be bad that is what makes them fun the line i like my dinosaur meat well done is probably the best quote ever also the plot sounds like something out of a pot induced dream i can imagine it now the writers waking up after a long night of getting high and playing dance dance revolution then putting ideas together for this space marines got to alien planet which is infested with dinosaurs and has medieval houses in it to protect a science team studying the planet best idea ever in fact in fits the complete sci fi original movie checklist guns dinosaurs medieval times space travel terrible actingso go watch this movie but do not buy it,1
196,no likeable characters the lead is a combination of the worst of woody allenpaul provensareiser and the contrived scenes did anyone really think thiat kid on the rollerblades was not going to knock the guy down were just sickeningly bad,0
197,it was simple and yet so nice i think the whole sense of sex segregation in society which can be bitter was shown very delicately it had a bitter kind of hummer in it the fact that most of the actors were not professionals made the movie more tangible and more realistic there was a documentary side to the movie too the best scenes were those that all the girls banned from watching were listening passionately to the soldier who is supposed to keep an eye on them broadcasting the game if you are an iranian the familiar cheering and dancing in the streets after a game won fills you up with national pride if you are not iranian you will still love it all the same,1
198,as the celebration of christmas has evolved through the years whether one concentrates on the religious or the secular traditions it is a time when people are supposed to behave a little better to each other that has somehow slipped past one ebenezer scrooge merchant and money lender in nineteenth century londonas his nephew points out to his uncle he does not keep christmas in any way because scrooge feels the whole thing is humbug the humanity in scrooge was driven out long ago he is a hard case a whole lot like his twentyth century counterpart mr potter of bedford falls new yorkbut as charles dickens told this tale redemption is not too late for any of us and a lonely ghost and three spirits visit scrooge and show him howa christmas carol is such a timeless holiday classic that we sometimes forget that it is as much a social commentary of nineteenth century great britain as oliver twist was the characters in this film are middle and lower class the cratchits are a couple of rungs above the street people in oliver twist but they are having to struggle to stay up there still love and happiness radiate their home no thanks to the guy bob cratchit works for like george bailey who did a whole lot of good in his life and just had to be reminded how much ebenezer scrooge needed a wake up call as to the potentiality he still had for doing some good in this old worldpatrick stewart in his live performances and filmed play has pretty much taken over the part of scrooge but george c scott captures the old miser pretty well in this film the meanness of him but with a trace of sadness that makes us root for him to change scott joins a fine tradition of people like reginald owen and alastair sim who have both done great interpretations of scroogeamong the supporting roles i particularly enjoyed david warner as bob cratchit and edward woodward as a hearty and stern spirit of christmas present according to imdb this is one of thirtytwo versions of a christmas carol made that they have archived and it is one of the best,1
199,this movie is beautifully designed there are no flaws not in the design of the set the lighting the sounds the plot the script is an invitation to a complex game where the participants are on a simple missionpaxton is at his best in this role his mannerisms the infections used in the tones of his voice are without miscue each shot meticulously done surprises turn up one after another when the movie reaches past its first hour this may not be the best picture of the year but it is a gem that has been very well polished it is not for the simple mind,1
200,my baby sitter was a fan so i saw many of the older episodes while growing up i am not a fan of scooby doo so i am not sure why i left the tv on when this show premiered to my surprise i found it enjoyable to me shaggy and scooby were the only interesting characters dodges tomatoes from fans of the others so i like that they only focus on those two however this may cause fans of the original shows to hate it i like the voice acting especially dr phinius phibes i liked listening to him even before i knew he was jeff bennett and jim meskimen as robi sounds to me like he is really enjoying his job as an actor i also get a kick out of the techies with their slightly autistic personalities and their desires to play dungeons and dragons or act out scenes from star wars not called by those names in the show of course,1
201,the crush is a pleasant enough fortysomething friends romantic chick flick for the first twothirds or so as it tries to be a brit sex and the city i particularly enjoyed the turnaround of the trophy young hunk whose character is not much fleshed out come to think of it we did not see all that much physical flesh of him either and kenny doughty is worth seeing more of they sure make a lot more deal of young manolder woman than was made of the opposite in either version of sabrina neither movie do i like or for that matter with the douglaszetajones or dionsvengali nuptialssurrounding andie macdowell as an ex pat otherwise are welcome familiars from brit dramas and comedies such as tarttongued anna chancellor the plot twists towards the end feel very deus ex machina but it was not until the credits came up at the end that i realized what might really be wrong just as with sex and the city the writerdirector is male here firsttimer scot john mckay and i think he really wanted to do a script about three gay men probably about them coming out in relation to their lovers and at work the characters are a school principal a cop and a doctor which would have been a better and more interesting movie the working title for the film was the sad fckers club which would have made its parallels with the gay broken hearts club even more obviousoriginally written foursixtwo thousand and two,0
202,i first saw this movie on mstthreek and although i laughed my posterior off at the jokes i do not particularly think this movie was all that bad sure it was a little hard to understand it is quite obviously low budget but it had a very hitchcocklike plot and i can honestly say that when i viewed the nonmstthreek version i was genuinely entertained this movie is crying out for a hollywood remake,0
203,redline is a knockoff of fast  furious without any of the redeeming qualities it does not need to have a convoluted plot with multiple twists and surprises but it needs something this is the equivalent of a porn film where the storyline and dialogue consist of sixty seconds at the beginning and the same at the end except that this is worse because you do not get your moneys worth mindnumbingly boring impossible race sequences and a terrible waste of expensive beautiful cars which almost acquire negative points for having appeared in this movie sure she is hot but who is that desperate for an on screen female i feel like the director sat there with a hat full of dialogue and plot snippets and shook an eight ball every time they switched scenes no serious person who races or knows anything about it would watch this movie and enjoy the race scenes,0
204,kirstie alley looking a bit slimmer but only a bit is in this mess along with a man who is a macguyver lookalike bleached blond hair and all the premise of the movie is about an older woman fifty who cannot get her screenplay produced due to age discrimination so she sends in her younger nephew to pose as the writer not an original idea and not a very good movie with lousy acting inane dialogue and a ridiculous plot there is another plot concerning a writer with a crush or admiration for kirsties character and why this is included is a mystery the actor who portrays kirsties brother is so wooden and miscast it was torture to watch their scenes what is there to say about this film avoid it,0
205,this is quite possibly the worst movie i have ever seen again i made the mistake of buying the movie because the synapse on the back sounded cool and the front cover looked pretty cool too after buying this and the movie malevolence which i reviewed on here as well i have learned my lesson i love horror movies that take place in the woods or in the desert or on a farm this supposedly takes place in the woods of texas but was probably filmed in the directors backyard the production was probably the worst i ever seen the actors were absolutely the worst the story did not have anything to do with what the back cover said i even tried to sell it to fye and some other mom and pop store that buys used dvds and neither would take it that is how awful this poor miserable excuse for a movie was i have seen some bad movies before troll two for example but this definitely takes the cake i did not think there was a worse movie than troll two boy was i wrong do not buy this movie unless someone hands it to you for free but even than your stuck with it unless you throw it out which is what i am about to do,0
206,this stylistically sophisticated visual game presents a story within a story the protagonist is scriptwriter bart klever who fights persistently with his new text  which is at the same time the screenplay of the film we are watching in the movie bart plays a scriptwriter writing the script of the film barts struggle with the text becomes a narrative theme as does the environment of the flat where he works and takes care of his little girl the intimate environment offers ample opportunity for games of illusion involving space light colours and a couple of cats the outwardly simple world of the room is further complicated by the unstable dimensions of a text continually influenced by the filmmakers interventions which appears on a computer monitor and serves as a counterpoint to the similarity mutable environment the constantly changing viewing angle complicates answers to questions which arise what is truth and what illusion  which of the observed worlds is primary and superior to the rest can anything serve as a basic orientation point in the narrative space,1
207,cheaplooking and ugly this film did not even seem to entertain the kids in the audience except for one fairly amusing toilet joke christopher lloyd is way past his prime and actually quite tiresome in this role although the sorry excuse for jokes by the writers do not help   elizabeth hurley is embarrassingly amateurish in a supposedly comic role jeff daniels and darryl hannah avoid humiliation there is really no reason to make this movie especially since it is unavoidable that one will compare it with robin williamss often brilliant improvisations in mork  mindy,0
208,it was everything this is not it had pace pop and actors who were not afraid to chew the scenery it also had a decent script this one had me scratching my head if farrah is not really serious about a career why does she have a manager and why is he wasting his time if kate and barney are artists why do they sign up for the mother of all jiggle shows like the brady bunch movie where robert reed wants to do shakespeare only to find himself on bb they were not industry names but they were not exactly starving either and while they got the history right the poster was released before farrah got the show silverman rejecting pitches for funniest home videos and american idol and spelling promising his baby girl tori someday he will create a show for her obviously did not happenwhat bothered me was how spellings role is distorted he is shown as the showrunner and creator when he was neither and how he comes up with the idea for ca was is laughablehow were spelling and goldberg allowed to enforce farrahs oral contract when the others were signed and why did not farrah or bernstein tell them she was leaving not because she discovered her inner diva but because majors wanted her to this is why when it tries tries to created conflict and tension by setting farrah up as the bad girl like suzanne somers it fails because the groundwork was never laid  that was where the threes company pic delivered,0
209,actually this flick made in one thousand nine hundred and ninetynine has pretty good production values the actors are attractive and reasonably talented there are not a bunch of clowns running around blasting away expending hundreds of rounds but never hitting flesh nor are there wild car chasescrashes where thousands of dollars worth of beautiful machines are uselessly trashedthe interiors look respectably modern architecturally and the equipment looks up to snuff well there is that high tech computer room furnished with what look like leftovers from a fiftys electronics lab and the pancake makeup on the corpses cracked me up not pancake makeup in the conventional sense but what looks like dried pancake batter slathered over their exposed skin this is supposed to support the idea that the bodies have calcified  though how the virus would accomplish this transmutation is an exercise left for the student viewerah yes the virus i would like to tell you that this is not the absolute worst premise for a scifi horror flick i know of but i cannot a computer virus that is transmitted via a television or computer monitor screen and becomes a lethal biological pathogen give me a break warp drives a la star trek are one thing but photons becoming viruses this is so silly the desired fright factor just is not realizable the flick could have used one of those awful dream sequences where the dead come alive or have a cat jump out of the closet or something because the viral thingamajig is not doing it one presumes robert wagner has the same excuse for playing in this inanity that lord oliver gave for some of his later trashy venues he needed the money no other comparison between the two should be construedhowever,0
210,this movie is awesome for three main reasons it is esthetically beautiful i absolutely loved that there is a bold color theme throughout the movie with extraordinary costumes and picturesque sets a photography which looks very costly and probably was not completes the look  i always enjoy those stories about groups of misfitsloners coming together and becoming a family  sometimes they fall into clichés but this one does not this group of actors really portrays well flawed yet extremely likable characters alan larkin is the best between him  the van and the road movie theme i could not help but remember my favorite movie of last year little miss sunshine  i discovered fabrizio bentivoglio  very interesting actor and just got annoyed a tiny little bit by til schweiger performance at times  the opening scene all the scenes where they mess up their tricks are very funny there is a mix of humor and emotion throughout the film i like the end a lot and of course it is all about the magician theme  a good magician is making the audience look where he wants them to to create an illusion which happens to be exactly what a movie director does and that is why they call it movie magic,1
211,name just says it all i watched this movie with my dad when it came out and having served in korea he had great admiration for the man the disappointing thing about this film is that it only concentrate on a short period of the mans life  interestingly enough the mans entire life would have made such an epic biopic that it is staggering to imagine the cost for productionsome posters elude to the flawed characteristics about the man which are cheap shots the theme of the movie duty honor country are not just mere words blathered from the lips of a highbrassed officer  it is the deep declaration of one mans total devotion to his countryironically peck being the liberal that he was garnered a better understanding of the man he does a great job showing the fearless general tempered with the humane side of the man,1
212,this is a cleaver film featuring love through the ages the film consists of keaton seeking out a lady love in the stone age in ancient rome and in the present one thousand nine hundred and twentys in all three cases he is the usual wimpy buster and he battles against wallace beery for his lady love of the three time periods i think i liked the roman one best even though i admit it might have also been the cheesiest i actually liked the scenes with the lion that was obviously a guy in a costume as well as the weird chariot race in the snowbut what i really enjoyed the most was seeing all of keatons amazing acrobatics however all three time periods were good old fashioned fun and the film while not his best is still an exceptional and enjoyable film check it out,1
213,okay when i came on the board for this movie i was really expecting people to be making fun of it i was surprised to see that people over the age of seven liked it i enjoyed the movie but only bc me and my little sister who is in fact only ten made fun of the whole thingi am sorry jordan but that acting was awful you know a movie is headed for the toilet when the lead cannot act and it did not even have a good script or plot to redeem it i also thought that the character of pamela was very very lame borderlining patheticeven with that being said i thought there were a few good actors such as gorgeous spencer hollywood and ronnie still not enough to redeem the movietwo things about this movie that i just cannot get overone that that spencer guy would fall for her okay eww i looked up the dates and while in reality he is only about four years older than her the difference in go figure seemed much larger jordan is a very pretty girl but in gf she seemed like ten or twelve she seemed like a little kid jake abel spencer seemed like a college studenttwo that there is any way that kristi yamaguchi would come just to skate for one girl i mean i know that katelin is good and everything but it still just seemed kind of unlikely that kristi would go to a boarding school that did not even have scholarships for skating or that a school would have employed a skating coach with such connectionsthat all being said it was not the worst movie ever known but it was not very good even by dcom standards which i consider quite low,0
214,i probably give this more credit than it deserves because it is halloween i was just at knotts scary farm and i was in a mood to watch a really cheesy halloween movieoh and it only cost me one dollarusually i will ffwd through a movie like this to get to the good stuff but i resisted the urge here and i am still not sure why it was obvious from the opening shots this was not a real movie not even a bmovie it is more in the category of the decoteau horror movies like the brotherhood that are shot on filmlook video for about fifty cents in fact i was half afraid any minute one of his beefy college boys would stagger out rubbing himself in his underpants or something there were no cutaway shots too expensive to do multiple camera setups and flat lighting butit is hard to pinpoint there is something refreshing about watching a director with no money pull off a halfdecent movie the fact that he is doing even a halfdecent job is commendable and this movie has it is share of meritsthe acting is not bad the photography is pretty good if too bright to be scary there are some surprises and the whole thing is sort ofdifferent somehowa bunch of college kids are for some unknown reason stuck in the warehouse where they are decorating the annual haunted house a creepy old man gives them a satanic book and they accidentally summon up the powers of hell this results in the costumed people in the haunted house becoming who they are made up to be and causing a lot of mayhem and human suffering along the way we are treated to an oddly complex and thoughtful lesbian relationship subplotit is interesting that this couple seems to be the most wellrounded in the movie yes there is a sex scene but it is not salaciousor at least no more so than you would find in any legit movie about lesbians that shows them having sex it is rather unusual for a horror film to take the time and effort to do this without resorting to cheap exploitation the other thing about this that held my interest was how it was clearly trying to emulate the stupid kids have sex and get killed vibe of the eightys slashers it is hard to take that on because there are so many of those films that already exist the genre has been done to death i am not sure if it is good or bad that these filmmakers simply tried to make another entry in that genre without irony as if it was still a living genre but i appreciated the attemptwhich is why i sat through it sometimes you just want to watch a mindless nobudget aforeffort horror film there really was too much set up not enough gore endless plotholes deadends and clichés and the unfortunate overall feel of a movie that simply did not have enough money behind it to be the film the producers envisionedbut at the very least the haunted house scenes were pretty cool i would pay to go to that haunted house if it existed and did not mind paying a dollar to see it on dvd even if i will never watch this againoh and possible spoiler but there was great brief business with the vampire girl in the coffin i used to be claustrophobic but i have changed ha ha good one,0
215,sidney franklins the good earth has achieved classic status thanks to a timeless story and superb acting especially from luis ranier who won an oscar for her portrayal of olan rainers performance is so complete she is nearly unrecognizable having very little dialogue throughout the entire film and it is a long one rainer relies instead on facial and body language she looks and acts chinese to the point that anyone unfamiliar with her work could easily mistake her as suchthe film remains relevant today because it explores the rags to riches story and the universal themes that come with it when lung and wife olan finally achieve financial success after years of famine and poverty they find a life full of possessions but lacking in meaning it is only when they return to the earth after fighting off a swarm of locusts the special effects used to create them are still incredible and beautiful to watch that they again find fulfillment a common formula told with the unique perspective of a chinese family especially for one thousand nine hundred and thirtyseven makes the film a classic money is not worth anything without friends and family a point that the film drives home perfectly in it is last ten minutes with an emotionally fulfilling conclusion,1
216,all this talk about this being a bad movie is nonsense as a matter of fact this is the best movie i have ever seen it is an excellent story and the actors in the movie are some of the best i would not give criticism to any of the actors that movie is the best and it will always stay that way,1
217,busy phillips put in one hell of a performance both comedic and dramatic erika christensen was good but busy stole the show it was a nice touch after the smokers a movie starring busy which was not all that great if busy does not get a nomination of any kind for this film it would be a disaster forget mona lisa smile see home room,1
218,well i hate hollywood but love cinema so i have to watch these cruddy movies in theaters and i was hoping vanilla sky would be good i was hoping that they would either keep the original open your eyes exactly the same or they would make it their own well it happened to be a little bit of both and it suckedit started out good i love radiohead i wish there was more of that but by the end we are listening to good vibrations by the beach boys talk about a wide range of suck between they had one or two good songs in the club and maybe a couple others but why oh why did they have to blare gv during the climax it was more annoying than confusing or blatant especially when it has nothing to do with the plot at least put some meaning behind the songs kid a  primary whateverhe also did a bang up job with the club scene that was cool otherwise the movie was one big ball of arrogance as if audiences would get the movie the ones that would get it read subtitles and the rest will not its as simple as that the motivations got all screwed up i did not comprehend the diaz motivations had not they done the chicken soup night before and some of the others and i hate kurt russell stay overboard tom cruise cannot act especially in these types of movie ie eyes wide shut and the elevator i get it anyways they tried improving the original with a crappy american rock soundtrack and crappy angles and good film print and glossy processing and it would have helped if crowe had not screwed it uptwoten major disappointment,0
219,when the us entered world war i the government forced hollywood to churn out propaganda films the little american is probably the best of the lot because it stars mary pickfordpickford plays a young woman torn between two men jack holt german and raymond hatton french but her decision is delayed because of the war as both men enlistwhen the ship pickford is sailing on is sunk by the germans think lusitania because it is carrying munitions pickford has a great scene as she stands on the lifeboat and yells at the german commander later on of course she runs into both holt and hatton when she is being held as a war prisoner at a châteaudirector cecil b demille provides one truly great scene in this film as pickford and holt are wandering through a bombedout village they pass a destroyed church of which only one wall remains standing against the wall is a very large crucifix as they stand and watch the wall collapses but the jesus figure remains suspended in mid air it is a very surreal moment in a film that is otherwise very straightforward and unartsypickford is as always a pleasure to watch she was always a very natural actress who avoided the armwaving histrionics many other actors of the day used she is also very very pretty holt is very good here in a leadingman role hatton is ok among the list of name actors in extra parts are wallace beery ramon novarro colleen moore ben alexander hobart bosworth norman kerry walter long james neill and edythe chapmannot a great film but interesting to see us propaganda at work,1
220,i just saw this film on dvd last night and decided to check out the reviews this morning it seems that i robot has polarized the critical viewing community here on imdb and given rise to a lot of insults and namecalling tooi find this somewhat surprising as this film is not great or even good but neither is it terrible or even really bad what this film really is isdepressing depressing that the us filmgoer population is so ready to lap up insipid clichéd reheats and acclaim them as spectacular new works this film as retread written all over it from the plot line an uneasy mix of asimov and modernday uberaction to smiths character a smartmouthed cynic with a backbone of titanium to the special effects that borrowed from matrix and a few othersi robot is sadly quite possibly the perfect action movie for todays audience superficial plot insipidly snappy dialog and lots and lots of adrenaline smith is mediocre but we already knew that he seems to be hollywoods latest unsuccessful attempt to create a black bruce willis the story has lots of holes in it of all sizes but i do not think most people drawn to this film are criticallyminded enough to notice perhaps a blockbuster by todays standards but very bmovie compared to true winners,0
221,in bridgeport the deranged high school teacher richard fenton johnathon schaech is obsessed by the teenager student donna keppel brittany snow she witnesses him murder her family to stay with her but richard is arrested and sent to prison for life three years later the traumatized donna is feeling better but is still under psychological treatment and taking pills on her prom night she goes with her boyfriend bobby scott porter and two couples of friends to the pacific grad hotel for the party but the psychopath richard has escaped from prison and is lodged in the same floor in the hotel chasing donna stabbing her friends and staff of the hotel that cross his paththe forgettable slash prom night is a collection of clichés with a total lack of originality the stupid story is shallow and silly with a bad acting of johnathon schaech in the role of an insane killer the predictable screenplay is amazing since it is possible to foresee what is going to happen in the next scenes my vote is threetitle brazil a morte convida para dançar the death invites to dance,0
222,this has to be the worst piece of garbage i have seen in a whileheath ledger is a heartthrob he looked deformed i wish i would known that he and naomi watts are an item in real life because i spent two of the longest hours of my life wondering what she saw in him orlando bloom is a heartthrob with the scraggly beard and deerintheheadlights look about him i cannot say i agreerachel griffiths was her usual fabulous self but geoffrey rush looked as if he could not wait to get off the set i am supposed to feel sorry for bankrobbers and murderers this is a far cry from butch cassidy which actually was an entertaining film this was trite clicheridden and boring we only stayed because we were convinced it would get better it did notthe last tenfifteen minutes or so were unintentionally hilarious heath and his gang are holed up in a frontier hotel and women and children are dying because of their presence that is not funny but it was funny when they walked out of the hotel with the armor on because all we could think of was the black knight from monty python and the holy grail i kept waiting for them to say i will bite yer leg off we were howling with laughter as were several other warped members of the audience when we left pretty much everyone was talking about what a waste of time this film wasi may not have paid cash to see this disaster sneak preview but it certainly was not free it cost me two hours of my life that i will never get back,0
223,i could not relate to this film it failed to engage me either intellectually emotionally or aesthetically the dialogue was very dense and uninvolving i could not connect with and hence care about any of the characters and i am finding it hard to find much that is positive to say about iti have read that to understand it properly one needs to be familiar with some of the more obscure aspects of catholic theology i will admit that as an atheist i probably am unfamiliar with many of the finer details of catholicism but i have also seen many films dealing with religious issues that have touched me because their themes are still universal to the human condition and do not rely on specialised knowledge or beliefs,0
224,the bourne ultimatum begins recklessly midchase and in pulsepounding fashion explodes from there as jason bourne matt damon absolutely superb tracks down the masterminds behind the cia blackops that turned him into the perfect killer in a final attempt to learn his true identity a devastatingly icy david strathairn as the man behind the curtain is added to the returning cast of regulars including joan allen excellent and julia stiles nonexistentlike the second entry in the series i wished paul greengrass shaky handheld camera would go static at least for the few minutes of downtime however that being said it is a perfect way to capture the tense claustrophobic feel of the intimate handtohandcombat scenes and works equally well in the chase scenes which are mostly on foot and across rooftops with the occasional big car pileup part of the fun of the bourne series is the constant globehopping and manipulation of technology and communications that seem to defy the laws of physics and current capabilities the bourne films seem to exist in some sort of gritty hyperreality that is full of technologicalbased magic it makes no sense that everyone seems to be just in the right place at the right time but i will be damned if it is not a blast to watch them get therewith the absence of the emotive and involving franka potente the writers attempt to create some emotional connection between damon and stiles but she is so blankfaced an actress it never really leads to anything still this can be forgiven for unlike the identity and the supremacy this ultimatum reveals all and we finally learn the truth about bournes past it is an entertaining and satisfying conclusion to the series and if they have any good sense and damon gets his wish this will be the perfect end to it,1
225,this cartoon was strange but the story actually had a little more depth and emotion to it than other cartoon movies we have a girl at a camp with low self esteem and hardly any other friends except a brother and sister who are just a miserable as she is she reaches the ultimate low point and when the opportunity arises she literally makes a pact with a devillike demon i found this film to be very true to life and just when things could not be worse the girl sees what she is done she feels remorse and then changes and then she helps this dark mystical creature learn the human quality of love the twins improve too by helping the little bears and then they get a sense of self worth too a very positive message for children though some elements of the film was strange it was and still is a rather enjoyable film the music from stephen bishop tootsie songs made the film even better,1
226,this is the kind of film you want to see with a glass of wine the fire on and with your feet up it does not require that much brainpower to follow so is very good after a long day i would say it is very unrealistic  if you expecting anything serious then do not bother but it is very funny just the thought that a businessman would go so far as to agree to live in a slum for a while and then actually get to enjoy it i would definitely recommend it,1
227,there is no denying that ealing comedies are good but for me this film stands out as one of the bestthe basic premise of the film is that a small part of pimlico in london is discovered to be part of burgundy not the uk we then follow the lives of the residents in their battle to keep the treasure found after the bomb explodes and keep out the black market traders who soon realise that being exempt from uk law rationing does not exist when they become prisoners in their own street because the government has decided to close the boarder we see them fight back against the systemthey are forced to ration water and food in their stand for what is right in fact becoming worse off than they were before it all started that is where the moral comes in it is when they loose all the food that they think they are beaten and call for a surrender only to have the whole of london respond to their plight by sending food lots of it thus enabling them to continue their strugglethis film hits the right note throughout the acting is superb with stanley holloway margaret rutherford hermione baddeley and betty warren standing out it is pitched just right not too sentimental and the moral of the story not forced down your throat well worth a viewing,1
228,i remember when i was five and my parents thought it was a regular cartoon movieexcept when the bras and bullets started flying i have to agree this movie will make anyone and everyone upset because it is set to discriminate everyone and anyonebut the truth is it is funny as hell as it is deep i recommend this to anyone who likes cult classics also try fritz the cat and the nine lives of fritz the cat if i am correct ralph bashki did that movie tooit involves a cat that goes through hard times with family streetsjobs  etc when i was old enough i rented all of these movies out because coonskin was an offensive title during that era it was also labeled as street fighter ralph bashki also made cool world starring a very young brad pitt heavy traffic was another cartoon that dealt with the street life of a young man,1
229,drones ethnic drumming bad synthesizer piping children singing the most patronizing world music imaginable this is a tourist film and a lousy one what really kills it is the incoherent sequences india egypt south america africa etc etc no transitions no visual explanation of why we are suddenly ten thousand miles away no ideas expressed in images just a bunch of footage of thirdworlders with baskets on their heads as another reviewer said walking along endlessly as if that had some deep meaning if these guys wanted to make a threerd world music video all they had to do was head a few hundred miles south of where the best parts of koya were shot and film in mexico that would have been a much better setting for life in transformationbut no what they decided on was a scrambled tourist itinerary covering half the globe and minddeadeningly overcranked filter shots the only thing to recommend this film is that it does not suck quite as much as naqoyqatsirstj,0
230,let me start by stating that i usually do like renny harlins directing style for the most part and that the cinematographer should be commended for some the shots unlike harlins elm street four and die hard two which i really liked there is something that is missing from this movie that my friends is a script the dialogue in movies like this is always pretty awful but this one takes the gold medal for stupidity there are so many awful lines in this movie i do not even want to have to remember any of them not just that but the execution of the lines is pathetic and seems more suited toward a bad porn movie than an action adventure it is almost like harlin thought that if they slowed down the words being said they could improve the script wrong againthe sad part is that there is some talented actors thrown into bad roles with worse dialogue stallone has never been a favorite of mine but when he is acting circles around lithgow turner and the worst of the bunch rooker there is something wrong with this picture lithgow played one of the best villains in ricochet yet comes across as someone who cannot act to save his life here how is that possible i have always been a huge fan of his and he gets schooled in acting by stallone who himself still phonedin his performance turners part is so small and pointless but she still manages to appear lost on screen michael rooker can act i know this because i have witnessed it in days of thunder but he seems like he is reading his lines from cue cards has it come to this when rooker and lithgow have scenes together where they are speaking i just wanted the movie to end right there or have them both amazingly find their acting ability unfortunately neither of those things occurredwhich brings me back to harlin who can be the only one to really blame for this mess other than the screenwriters it is his fault that i was never drawn into this movie at all because he should have made the people actually act the script is not very good but still the actors performances are what destroys this movie and that has to lie with the director i do not care how much was paid for the special effects which for the most part are good you still cannot just sacrifice the movie with terrible acting plus the pacing of this movie seems to be off the opening sequence was good and the plane scene was very well done but how are you supposed to care about the outcome of the heist at all i mean i understand that they were trying to create tension with all of the bells and whistles of the plane scene but i really did not care if they got the money or not in that scene if the bad guys would have won early maybe i would not have had to witness one of the worst movies ever,0

234,this three stooges flick is at a tie with my other favorite flick disorder in the court this is an uproar of laughter for any three stooges fan to enjoythe boys are janitors at a recording studio when they hear the lovely christine mcintyre sings a great version of voices of spring she is going to be offered a record deal but she is scarred to be honest with her father about her choice of a career and prove herself as a real singer when she and the others leave the studio the stooges decide to have a little fun and play her record and dress curly up as christine the contract lady who can make christines career sees curly and mistakes him for christine and invites curly to sing for her party of course there is a man that they have upset that is at the party and they destroy his solo in front of the crowd so he will find a way to get back at themwhat a great stooge flick this should not be missed tenten,1
235,there is a lot going on in the college girl murders a mad scientist creates an almost undetectable poisonous gas before he can reap the rewards of his discovery the scientist is killed by a hooded whipwelding monk after a coed is killed in a church by the gas scotland yard is called in to investigate but the killing continues who can stop this mad killer who seems to be able to come and go as he pleases in and out of the college what works  the killer what is not to like about a killer who sneaks around wearing a vivid red kkk looking outfit complete with red gloves the white whip he carries and uses very effectively stands out nicely against the bright red gown although the idea of a killer in a flaming red pointyhead outfit sneaking around a girls school is fairly farfetched it is one of the more sinister looking costumes i have seen groovy sixtys music i really would like to track down the title music to the college girl murders it is got a jazzy hip sixtys feel to it that i just loved bizarre touches beyond the killers red gown and hood the movie features a sliding fireplace a pit of alligators with a cage handing overhead poison spraying bibles a strategically placed mannequin miniskirts gogo boots and mile high hair i would describe it as a cross between the sixtys batman tv show and an italian giallo the college girl murders is a real treat for the eye the end let us just say that there are more twists than a mountain road just when you think the killer has been uncovered here comes a twistand anotherand anotherand anotherwhat does not work  chief inspector sir john i know the guy was meant to be comic relief but his buffoonish character has way too much screen time why have alligators previously i mentioned the alligators in the pit and while they are a nice touch they serve very little purpose why go through all the trouble and not use them  plodding plot some of the college girl murders has no flow or rhythm to it there are far too many moments throughout the movie when things come inexplicably to a screeching halt better pacing would have made this a much more enjoyable moviei have not seen many of these german krimis but of the few i have seen phantom of soho strangler of blackmoor castle dead eyes of london this may be my favorite this one has a real funky feel to it that i really go into had the plot flowed a little better i could have easily given the college girl murders a seventen,1
236,first of all i liked very much the central idea of locating the  intruders others in the fragile self on various levels  mainly subconscious but sometimes more allegorical in fact the intruders are omnipresent throughout the film  in the swissfrench border where the pretagonist leads secluded life in the his recurring daydream and nightmare inside his ailing body after heart transplantation in the last half of the film he becomes intruder himself returning in ancient french colony in the hope of atoning for the past the overall tone is bitter rather than pathetic full of regrets and guilts sense of failure being more or less dominant this is a quite grim picture of an old age ostensibly selfdependent but hopelessly void and lonely inside the directer composes the images more to convey passing sensations of anxiety and desire than any explicit meanings some of them are mesmerizing not devoid of humor though kind of absurdist play only somnambulist can visualize,1
237,big spoilers i have seen one other takashi miike film and that was the very disturbing and brutal audition which was an examination of the japanese ideals of femininity in visitor q which i think means visitor question he examines in a very disturbingly gross way the family unit miikes surreal vision of a dysfunctional family almost tries to be lynchian in terms of confusion and filmmaking but ultimately lacks the style and intrigue we the audience are introduced to a bizarre array of scenarios from the opening scene with the father figure kenichi endo who was actually quite good paying for sex with his displaced daughter fujiko then as the father returns home he is struck on the head by the visitor kazushi watanabe wielding a fairly sizeable rock and for some reason they both end up back at the family home the mother shungiku uchida is beaten and bullied by her son jun muto who is also beaten and bullied by his school peers when the visitor enters the home he somewhat menacingly establishes himself as part of the unit eventually the family begin to improve their relationship with assistance from the visitor through milking breasts murder and retaining a sense of family prideand there are other crazy scenes that somehow bring the family closer together it is has uncomfortable humour but is equally frustratingly silly and overthetop in its weirdness there is a necrophiliac scene that is utterly disgusting but ends up being ridiculously funny as the scene progresses partly because of the situation itself and partly because you cannot believe the filmmakers and the actors are actually doing this the style of the film is poor to say the least and the plot is stupid and unbelievably weak the characters themselves are all over the place and while i understand this is not meant to be realistic there is hardly any interest in these confronting characters and situations as all of them border on the absurd the camerawork is sloppy and does not have that cinematic feel that lynchs work entails it is hard to take this film seriously on a surrealist level or on an interpretation of examining the family unit in japan it just seems that miike was out to shock and the film seems selfaware that it is trying to be shocking and it becomes almost comical to be taken seriously all in all i would say that this film is a bizarrely dark comedy but it looks and feels amateurish and seems to unnecessarily want to shock miikes previous film audition was finely balanced between disgusting horror character development and technique which established more intrigue in the way the film was crafted to allow the viewer to become engrossed with the plot visitor q is a step down as it tries too hard to be outlandishly bizarre and intentionally confronting without really having much to say in the process  out of ,0
238,i never fail to be amazed and horrified by the evil that has been predicated in the history of the world in the name of religion and it seems that the machinations of the catholic church in twentieth century ireland rank right up there near the top  considering that the wisdom of history and modern times should have had some sobering effecta love divided is the story of a real family scarred by ignorant intolerance and prejudice all in the name of an inane church doctrine at the beginning of the film we are offered a view of the bucolic life in a small irish village in which sheila and sean cloney are happily married with two young children sean is catholic and sheila is protestant but she has no qualms with their children being raised as catholic there is no sign of any animosity between the catholics and protestants in the village the peaceful and loving relationships are soon shattered when sheila expresses the desire to have their older child attend the protestant school the local priest takes it upon himself to forbid this sin and soon has sheilas husband and the entire catholic population of the village turned against her as well as her father the local dairy farmer in an act of defiance and desperation sheila kidnaps her two daughters and flees from the areaspecial note should be given to orla brady who plays sheila she gives an extremely powerful performance in which the viewer is drawn in to the emotional trauma in which she decides to reject the wishes of a husband she deeply loves in order to express her fervent desire to establish herself as independent from the pressures of the establishment on an equal footing is liam cunningham who plays sean for he gives a realistic portrait of a man not nearly as complex as his wife who is torn between his love for her and the influence of church and communityif fiction this film would have been a compelling and interesting drama considering it is true it changes to a horrific tragedy in real life the people and the village never fully recovered from the events that took place there it took almost half a century for the church to acknowledge its negative role in the events and even though sheila and sean lived out their lives in the area they never fully recovered from what was done to them by the religious leaders and their fellow villagerswhether it be denying basic rights to education of choice crashing planes into buildings subjugating women condemning whole races or just plain on torture and murder we humans certainly have the ability to use religion as a powerful negative force in our society,1
239,this is a typical example of technically highly skilled directors of video clipscommercials trying to do their first full feature length movie on one hand the imagery camera lighting cgi and even the sound are highly polished and have a truly expensive look and feel even the actors show a certain amount of potential  unto the point where even the best acting could not hide a bad plotin this case it is not a bad plot but hardly a plot at allso fifty of the dialog consists of what the hell was that  what was that  and what the hell was that  in none of the cases any of the characters nor the audience is provided with the slightest hint of an answer though in most of the other dialogues one gets the feeling that there never was any form of dialogue book and the actors had to freely improvise to a plot that was not ever explained to themthe only reason why skye bennets performance could be so good is that her character as an autistic girl did not allow giving her these tragically horrible dialogue lines the other actors had to deal with that way she was able to just show her acting talent which the rest of the cast could not even get close to i mean there is not one actor in the world that could make up for a dialogue like thisben is this real huh  emily stop it ben a mass psychosis huh  jon somebody has to take control of this situation ben this situation cannot be controlled not by you not by anybody emily not by you either ben nogot me goosebumps but not for horror more for the horrible attempt in some moments i felt ashamed for the actors to have added this to their vitatwo stars for the excellent technical work,0
240,you like to solve mysteries you like complex narrations this is for you brilliant clever movie by francis leclercson of a legendary french canadian signer felix leclerc flashy photo and clever editing is the word of leclerc strongly helped by roy dupuis who is dythirambic in the lead rolethe plot is about alexandre tourneur veterinary in his fortys who just woke up from a coma after being unplugged by somebody unknown tourneur is struggling to remember who hit him as he was ending a deers sufferings on the road throughout the struggling he has weird behavior and it seems like something took over himnot spooky but very mysterious and well played movie i have my hypothesis on the endingi think the indian caused the accident but this ending was open to any explanationsi strongly recommend it ninefiveten,1
241,this movie is a little ray of sunshine in a dark season it celebrates a quality best described as plain old friendliness morgan freeman plays a character very like freeman himselfa successful actor pushing seventy he has traveled to a small rather grimy grocery store intending to research a part he might play as a manager of such a place he soon beguiles the staff and the customers especially the lovely if cranky young woman paz vega who presides over the ten items or less checkout laneten items or less does not have a big statement to make and does not pretend that it does it follows freeman and vega as they become friendly and as the older man offers his counsel in exchange for a ride homethe moviecompany gofer who is supposed to pick him up never shows and freeman has forgotten his own phone number so he cannot call for help i had a little case of the blues on a gray sunday afternoon in new york city and this flick cured what ailed me,1
242,ladies and gentlemenplease do not get fooled by a stanley kubrick film tagthis is a very bad film which unfortunately has been hailed as one of the deadliest horror films ever madehorror films should create such a fear that during nights people should shiver their hearts out while thinking about a true horror filmin shiningthere is no real horror at all but what we find instead is just a naivefoolish attempt made to create chilling horroreveryone knows as to how good the attempts are if they are different from realityall that is good in the film is the view of the icy valley the hotel where most of the actors were lodged appears good tooa word about the actors jack nicholson looks like a lostlazy soul who is never really sure of what he is supposed to dothere is not much to be said of a baldcolored actor who for the most of times is busy pampering a kid actorno need to blame the bad weather for the tragedyit cannot be avoided as the film has been made and poor kubrick is not alive to make any changes,0
243,i cannot believe this movie was made as recently as one thousand nine hundred and eightyfour it is got some laughable acting not to mention one of the stupidest plots ever who would ever ask fat texas sheriff joe don baker to escort an italian he illegally arrested in mexico back to italy not to mention that the title of the movie tells you pretty much nothing about it  in fact it is about as generic a title for a wannabe actioncop film as i can think ofi am glad i only saw this on mstthreek with mike and the bots as a shield they remark on the female leads resemblance to elaine from seinfeld none of them are spongeworthy and riff nonstop on bakers weight this movie probably is not worse than mitchell but bakers reputation definitely precedes him here when his title comes up at the beginning of the film tom says i wish i was illiterate so i would not have to read that,0
244,the movie has a great written genre story it features all of the usual columbo ingredients the way lt columbo approaches and bonds to his suspect the way the mystery unravels for him columbos dog the cat and mouse play which is great in this one and luckily as well some good relieving humor mostly involving the columbo character it is all written despite the fact that it does not even have a truly original concept columbo hunting down a detectivemurder novel writer had been done more than once before in a columbo movieit is also an extremely well directed movie from james frawley who after this directed five more columbo movies in the seventys and eightys he provided the movie with style and some truly great and memorable sequencesit is one of the slower moving columbo movies despite not having a too long running time this style and approach does not always work out well for a columbo movie but in this movie it does which is perhaps not in the least thanks to the acting performances of the moviemost columbo movie either starred a big well known star or a star from the early days of filmmaking as the movie its murderer this movie stars the rather unknown eightyone year old ruth gordon she did not starred in an awful lot of movies throughout her career but she is still well known to some mostly for her role in rosemarys baby which also won her an oscar she had a realistic and somewhat unusual style of acting which some people might not like though it earned her four more oscar nominations throughout her career prior to her win for rosemarys baby in one thousand nine hundred and sixtynine she has some great interaction as well with peter falk in their sequences togetherthe movie also stars a still young gd spradlin i say young because i only know him from his latest productions out of his career despite the fact that he already was fiftyseven at the time of this columbo production he is still alive but retired from acting ever since one thousand nine hundred and ninetyninean even better than usual columbo movie entryeightten,1
245,admittedly i find al pacino to be a guilty pleasure he was a fine actor until scent of a woman where he apparently overdosed on himself irreparably i hoped this film of which i would heard almost nothing growing up would be a nice little gem an overlooked aheadofitstime intelligent and engaging citypolitical thriller it is notcity hall is a movie that clouds its plot with so many characters names and realistic citywide issues that for a while you think its a plot in scope so broad and implicating that once you find out the truth it will blow your mind in truth however these subplots and digressions result ultimately in fairly tame and very familiar urban story trademarks such as corruption of power twofaced politicians mafia with police ties etc and theoretically this setup allows for some thrilling tension the fear that none of the characters are safe and anything could happen but again it really does notunfortunately the only things that happen are quite predictable and we are left with several confession monologues that are meant as a whole to form modern a fable of sorts a lesson in the moral ambiguity of the real world of politics and society but after one hundred and ten minutes of names and missing reports and a spiderweb of lies and coverups the audience is usually treated to a somewhat satisfying reveal i do not think we are left with that in city hall and while it is a very full film i do not find it altogether rich,0
246,let us begin with that theme song sung by christopher cross the song is if you get caught between the moon and new york city it is a great theme and song even after all these years it never gets tiring it really is a great song about new york city as well anyway the great dudley moore cbe stars as a spoiled drunken millionaire who is engaged to jill eikenberrys character in the film jill would later star on la law anyway he is served by his wonderful british butler sir john gielgud om who won an academy award for his performance in the film as best supporting actor arthur falls in love with liza minnellis character who is perfect in this film besides her performance in her oscar winning role in cabaret no liza does not get to sing she plays a diner waitress anyway i love geraldine fitzgerald as the bach matriarch of the family who decides the familys fortune anyway she is fabulous and should have gotten an academy award nomination herself for best supporting actress barney martin best known as jerrys dad on seinfeld plays lizas dad he is great too the movie was wellwritten acted and delivered to the audience who wanted more of it,1
247,this has the absolute worst performance from robert duval who sounds just like william buckley throughout the entire film his hammy melodramatic acting takes away from any dramatic interest i am not sure if this was deliberate scene stealing or inadvertent but it is the only thing i can recall from a truly forgettable film this picture should be shown in every amateur acting class of an example of what not to do thank god duvall went on to bigger and better things and stopped trying to effect a cultured accent he is a good character actor but that is about it klaus is so much better his performance is muted and noteworthy,0
248,this film is a wonderful movie based on the life of a man called grey owl in one thousand nine hundred and thirtys canada i found it to be similarly riveting and heartfelt as rudy and awakenings it picks up late in grey owls life and follows him through his most tumultuous and influential periodthe film is about a canadian indian trapper who finds himself promoting the plight of the overtrapped beaver he also predicts the decrease in natural lands and the overuse of earths resources this is an outrageous concept in the one thousand nine hundred and thirtys and surprisingly well received he becomes a well known speaker and the masses are ready to listenthe casting of pierce brosnan seems rather odd but is not outrageous anyone wanting to argue that point must first watch the movie to understand brosnan provides a wonderful performance as does annie galipeau galipeau is a strong actress whose place beside brosnan is refreshingly natural compared to the forced pairings in recent bond filmsi would recommend this film to anyone interested in good drama beautiful scenery or environmental causes it is a movie for families as well however children under ten depending on maturity would have trouble following the plot,1
249,i really cannot remember who recommended this but they said it was one of their favorite films it is certainly a strange one  like rubbernecking at a highway accidentsomeone said that truth is stranger than fiction and the truth here is something to see i really cannot understand how a fictionalized account of this documentary is to be released this year how can you improve on this the aunt and cousin of jackie kennedy remove themselves from new york society and hide in the hamptons in the process they become recluses and what is best described as crazy cat ladies they would have stayed hidden had not the city move to condemn the property for the filth and the subsequent rescue by jackie this film was done after that rescue all during you could not help but think how bad was it before it is a look at high society from the darker side and it is utterly fascinating,1
250,i was so looking forward to seeing this when it was in productionbut it turned out to be the the biggest let down a far cry from the whimsical world of dr seuss it was vulgar and distasteful i do not think dr seuss would have approvedhow the grinch stole christmas was much better i understand it had some subtle adult jokes in it but my children have yet to catch on whereas the cat in the hat screamed vulgarity they caught a lot more than i would have likedgrowing up with dr seuss it really bothered me to see how this timeless classic got trashed on the big screen let us see what they do with horton hears a whoi hope this one does dr seuss some justice,0
251,oh my god this movie insults the intelligence of everybody i mean really who thinks three kids can fight thirty to forty ninjas and win not to mention the brainless humor thrown in this film is baaaaaaaaaaaaaad the movie is an omen the only thing it is good for is a time killer or unintentional laughs,0
252,a stage company cast finds themselves terrified when a bizarre killer known as the fiend targets them for death a pair of reporters and their clumsy photographer set out to work the story of the fiend and find themselves targets as well just as you think our trio of heroes has the case solved you are thrown another twist that has you wondering who the killer really is according to the dvd sleeves synopsistaking the hunchback of notre dame to hollywood producer sam katzmans lack of studio settings probably helps a face in the fog look interesting especially toward the end one thousand nine hundred and thirtys traffic the direction could be improved upon for example the camera angle on the fight scene is not helpful the budget appears slight under the circumstances most of the silenttalkie crossover cast perform it amiably a face in the fog twoonethirtysix robert f hill  lloyd hughes june collyer al st john,0
253, for paris is a moveable feast ernest hemingwayit is impossible to count how many great talents have immortalized paris in paintings novels songs poems short but unforgettable quotes and yes  movies the celebrated film director max ophüls said about paris it offered the shining wet boulevards under the street lights breakfast in montmartre with cognac in your glass coffee and lukewarm brioche gigolos and prostitutes at night everyone in the world has two fatherlands his own and paris paris is always associated with love and romance and paris je taime which is subtitled petite romances is a collection of short films often sketches from eighteen talented directors from all over the world in each we become familiar with one of the city of light twenty arrondissements and with the parisians of all ages genders colors and backgrounds who all deal in love in its many variations and stages in some of the petite romances we are the witnesses of the unexpected encounters of the strangers that lead to instant interest closeness and perhaps relationship like for podalydès and florence muller in the street of montmartre in the opening film or for cyril descours and leïla bekhti as a white boy and a muslim girl whose crosscultural romance directed by gurinder chadha begins on quais de seine i would include into this category the humorous short film by gus van sant in le marais one boy pours his heart out to another boy confessing of sudden unexpected closeness asking permission to call  never realizing that the object of his interest does not understand frenchsome of the vignettes are poignant and even dark in walter salles and daniela thomas loin du sixteenème catalina sandino mareno amazing oscar nominated debut for maria full of grace is single workingclass mother who has to work as a nanny in a wealthy neighborhood to pay for daycare where she drops her baby every morning before she goes to work one of most memorable and truly heartbreaking films is place des fêtes by oliver schmitz aïssa maïga and seydou boro costar as two young people for who love could have happened there were the promises of it but it was cut short due to hatred and intolerance that are present everywhere and the city of love and light is no exception another one that really got to me was bastille written and directed by isabel coixet starring sergio castellitto miranda richardson and leonor watling castellitto has fallen out of love with his wife richardson but when he is ready to leave with the beautiful mistress the devastating news from his wifes doctor arrivesi can go on reflecting on all eighteen small gems i like some of them very much the others felt weak and perhaps will be forgotten soon but overall i am very glad that i bought the dvd and i know that i will return to my favorite films again and again they are place des fêtes that i have mentioned already pèrelachaise directed by wes craven that involves the ghost of one of the wittiest and cleverest men ever oscar wilde alexander payne the director of sideways who would save one troubled relationship payne also directed fourteenth arrondissement in which a lonely middleaged postworker from denver co explores the city on her own providing the voice over in french with the heavy accent paynes entry is one of the most moving and along with hilarious tuileries by joel and ethan coen with who else  steve buschemi is my absolute favorite in both shorts american tourists sit on the benches margo in the park and steve in paris metro after visiting louvers observing the life around them with the different results while margo may say my feelings sad and light my sorrow is bright steves character will find out that sometimes even the most comprehensive and useful tourist guide would not help a tourist avoiding doing the wrong things in a foreign country,1
254,i have wanted to see this for the longest time james merendino is a great director slc punk is one of my favorite movies and in the first ten minutes of this film i thought that it was a great follow up after that though it begins to drag the acting and direction were terrific in fact everything in the film seemed to flow except for the script at times the only thing keeping my attention was the fact that in the cast was the most beautiful woman in the world claire forlani this film was good but i expected moreps look for great cameos by chi mcbride and chris mcdonald,1
255,this is bar none the most hilarious movie i have ever seen beginning with the four delinquents being sent off by their fathers to wienberg military academy a tone is set that steadily continues all throughout this goofball film and it does not let up for a secondit is tough trying to describe this film the humor elements are so spot on and brilliantly concieved that upon a first look it appears as nothing more than a stupid eightys teen lust comedy but it is oh so much more than that fresh from the minds of those folks over at mad magazine up the academy serves up a formula and style that i have never since seen duplicated by any of the funniest offerings to come out of hollywood in years past basically the film is so full of infantile cornball material that you might guess that the writers were a couple of fourteen year olds themselves see this movie if you love to act immature a classic ,1
256,i must admit  the only reason i bought this movie was because i am a big fan of gackt and a huge fan of hyde i was expecting a good movie with a lot of shots that were shall we say pleasing to the feminine eye but a slightly cheesy story i mean the synopsis sounded really out there and now that i have just finished watching it  i feel the need to tell the world of its brilliance hyde and gackt both gave heartwrenching performances and my eyes are still hot from the crying that lasted throughout the last half of the movie you get sucked into the story and you really feel for the characters by the end the element of vampirism  which i love but is very easy to overdo or to ruin a movie with  is subtly mixed into the storyline as to make it something merely exotic normal to this setting rather than a random unnecessary addition to the story i ranked it at a nine out of ten at firstand then i went back and tried to think of why i was not giving it that last point came up with nothing so a ten out of ten it is after all  i am not much of a critic  the fact that i am bothering to write a review at all means i either really hate the movie or really love it you can tell what side i am on with moon child,1
257,this movie is just great if you have a chance to see it then you should run to see it even though the movie has almost nothing to do with its original from one thousand nine hundred and thirtytwo pacino does a great job playing as tony montana to get around pacino has this way about him where he can say anything in anyway and make it sound just great if you thought that pulp fiction was good with the swear words if you saw it then you should also see scarface to see another angle at how an actor can say them its quite sweet even though the movie is has a lot of action and the plot moves very fast through time not keeping the realtime aspect ratio correct it is still easy to follow along but you must keep your eyes peeled at all times to not lose anything personally i have found that watching this movie makes three hours seem like a breeze it is really just that great this movie is one of thoe movies that is acted and directed so well that not only do you forget that this movie was made in the crappy eightys but that it makes you actually root for the bad guy so say good night to the bad guy,1
258,i stumbled across this acti by pure dumb luck and this was more than a decade ago this wasnt even what the cover label on the tape mentioned it amazed me it intimidated me it shocked me i eventually forgot about and almost a decade later i happened to think about it again then went and bought both acts they were even better than i had experienced at firstmy only complaint is that while the tank police keep on going on and on about being at war with crime warranting tanks and heavy artillery it would seem as though they are really having a hard time with criminals that is either never shown or is simply a lie as they appear to be taking it easy most of the time if that bit about being in a state of war was really propaganda it certainly has not been shown as suchi do not think the original japanese version could have been any where as good as the americanized version of this but regarding the story there has certainly been some proper explanations lost in translation but it can be excused,1
259,chris rock stars in this remake of warren beattys heaven can wait itself a remake of the one thousand nine hundred and fortyone film here comes mr jordan a comedy about a man who dies before his time before he can realize his dreams and his adventures in his new albeit temporary body in the beatty version the protagonist was a backup quarterback for the thenlos angeles rams in rocks hipper version our lead character is a struggling young  and decidedly lowtalent  standup comedianit is very funny to see the razorsharp rock playing a bad comedian it is kind of like seeing tom hanks play a bad actor lance bartons dream is to play the legendary apollo theater on a nonamateur night but every time he tries out his material he is booed off the stage lustily  so much so that his nickname becomes booie his jokes are lame his delivery painful in short lance is everything that the real chris rock is notlance is also a bike messenger and he is riding the streets on his way to try out even more material when bam he is hit by a truck ok so maybe he was taken from his body a tenth of a second early by a slightly incompetent angel eugene levy but hey he was going to get hit anyway no dice it appears lance is not due in heaven until two thousand and fortyfour so what to do mr king chazz palminteri the manager of heaven reluctantly agrees to find a new body for the notquitedead mr barton trouble is the body they find is of a greedy old white man turns out this fella a mr wellington owns all kinds of things  he is the fifteenth richest man in the country what luck you can imagine how lance will turn things around but of course while in the body of the affluent mr wellington lance falls for a gorgeous hospital worker regina king we males know how tough it is to find a female given our own body but try winning one over while you are an dumpy old white guy and it is even worse when she is not impressed by your money this is rocks first shot at a lead role and in my opinion he performs admirably there is still a lot of the standup comedian in him  and of course if he ever wants to get diverse roles he might have to stop incorporating standup routines into the script  but this is not really a bad thing rocks personality  his drive his delivery his demeanor and his passion  are what fuel this film he is clearly having a lot of fun in the role and he seems bent on making sure you have fun watching him,1
260,i got the first bill and ted movie for christmas and i had to get the second when i saw it in a store this one was i think just as funny as the first but a much wierder story it was funny how they had their own personnal hell and how they had to play death the funny thing was that they played him in stupid little games like clue the only thing i would change is station and death being in the band but other than that it was great,1
261,someone must have been seriously joking when they made this filmfirstly it is an absolute impossibility that this movie was made in one thousand nine hundred and ninetythree the fashions and music dictate that this is seriously eightys my guess is that this has sat on the shelf for a long while before some crazed distributer picked it up and released it to a disbelieving worldthere is a plot kind of a strange loner meets a random man with a beard who tells him that if he meditates while singing his favourite song he will be able to turn into whomever he chooses at this point i feel obliged to point out that the loners favourite song is london bridge is falling down why is this his favourite song because he is an idiot we are only a minute into the film and already the film has reached a monumental level of stupidity it gets even stupiderthe loner is the nostril picker i can only assume this as there are two scenes in the film where he is seen picking his nose that clears up the title he decides to change into a girl so that he can get close to other girls and kill them that is more or less itthe acting is universally appalling every single performance in this movie sucks in fact i would go so far as to say that the acting is of the standard of a pornographic movie it really is that terrible the nostril picker appears to the audience as the nostril picker the characters in the movie see him as the girl he has become through singing london bridge is falling down man i feel like an idiot even typing this anyway it is kind of strange seeing a middle aged weirdo hanging out with school girls and not in a good way there is even an extended montage of scenes where the nostril picker is at school with the girls and a song plays over the top it is very possibly the worst song ever recorded i am not even going to describe it you will know it when you hear it and you will agree with methere are some scenes of violence sure and there is a benny hill style chase sequence involving a transsexual there is even an immortal bit of dialogue that may or may not have been taken from shakespeare or john milton where the nostril picker says to a prostitute i have got the cash if you have got the gash lovely i am sure you will agreeutter nonsense,0
262,a wonderful film by powell and pressburger whose work i now want to explore more the film is about what we perceive as real and what is real and how the two can be so difficult to distinguish from one another beautifully shot and acted although david niven does not seem to be twentyseven years old as his character claims to be fun to see a very young richard attenborough this film made me think while i was watching it and afterwards,1
263,if you want to learn the basics of quantum mechanics spend your nine on a used textbook not this movie i am a little worried that the money i spent is being used to buy koolaid for shipment to guyana i do not think the directors really got any point across but it looks like maybe they were trying to make several one science can explain everything we do meaning that our lives are deterministic two science cannot be used to explain everything we do meaning that we have free will three science is like really cool brother four we are god five the world exists only in our minds six sarah norman is a tough role to follow and seven here put this tiny paper square in your mouth and you will see some really groovy stuff,0
264,this is the kind of movie i fear the most arrogant and irresponsible it presents a sketch of the colombian conflict so cliched and dumb it represents an insult to all colombian people the performances are godawul from grisales her naked scene is absolutely pitiful to bejarano to fanny mickey who looks right out of a tim burton nightmare to díaz who makes a notable effort to bring life to a character so onedimensional so cliched and so badly written all he´s left to work with is a mustache not to mention the gratuitous ending a gore fest so cheesy that it would make ed wood cringe it fails in all ways cinematography art direction costumes makeup editing and most of all directing jorge alí triana has always been a lousy filmmaker but at least his previous movies had some dignity i cannot say anything good about this waste of money except that i hope colombian filmmakers learn a lesson about honesty integrity and responsability from this meanintended fiasco,0
265,i have to start by telling you how i came across this movieit was winter time in alaska around the year one thousand nine hundred and ninetya friend of mine from australia was staying with me and my girl friend in a shoe box of an apartmentwinters in alaska can be a bit brutal and most people stay indoorsdrink heavily and watch anything that comes on the televisioni had found this movie outside of a thrift store laying in a snowbank and right away new it was a treasureit is quite possibly the best worst movie everwe spent the next two weeks watching this movie and drinking like fishwe watched it so many times in fact that we would sometimes turn the television on its side or upside down for a more full filling effectit is a true gemthe laughs will come nonstop and the memories last foreverif you see this movie for rent in a video storesteal ityou will not regret it,1
266,i thought that the sentinel was going to be a mediocre moviewhen i finally saw iti took a good surprisethe movie is not great thing but it is very fun and the action scenes are very well donethis movie reminded me tv series like twentyfour or aliasit is very similar to that series and it reminded me tooto the wolfgang petersens thriller in the line of fireif you are going to expect one of the most original and and one of the greatest thrillers in the history of moviesyou will be disappointedbut if you go with little expectationsyou will enjoy the sentinelratingseven,1
267,you want to see the movie the gamers by dead gentlemen productions this is not that movie this movie is not funny it is a waste of timeall of the good comments here seem to be written by poorly disguised false third parties the people who made this movie seem to be attempting to synthesize fake interestthis movie is not a well done mockumentary comparisons to spinal tap or christopher guest are insultingthe movie is so meanspirited that i cannot imagine anyone familiar with the subject matter finding it funny being able to laugh at yourself is an important quality but if you are the ones being lampooned in this manner you would have to hate yourself to enjoy itthe movie is not offensive because of its grand satire of taboo topics but because of its constant pathetic banality,0
268,this has to be one of my favourite movies of all time the dialogue with the constant use of puns is very tight the cast are superb and the plot is highly originaldo not take my word for it  watch this movie and enjoy it for yourself,1
269,there is enough star power in the house of spirits to create another galaxy yet the final product is pretty debatable the film and its messages are very noble and i think perhaps most would agree with them liberal democracy good violent fascist regime bad openmindedness good racism bad etc unfortunately we are battered from head to toe with these and as much subtlety is used as i have described them ultimately we are left watching very noble people without any flaws squaring off with nasty cretins who have no redeeming qualities it radiates with all the suspense of a badly orchestrated pro wrestling matchjeremy irons plays the patron a man of many contradictions meryl streep as his gifted bride and glenn close as her sister in law when the camera stays with these folks the movie tends to move and is quite enjoyable unfortunately the house of spirits engages with simply way too many subplots and characters pop up and out of the picture like shooting gallery targets we do not get to know them hence we do not get to care for them the result is boredom if bille august the director and screenwriter from isabel allendes book had either lengthened the film or snipped a few characters this film might have worked completely as it stands it was a nice try with nice messages and a bonecrushing yawnfestnot recommended,0
270,this was the first regular filmed columbo movie episode but yet it aired as the second after steven spielbergs columbo murder by the book it is also at the same time among one of the better onesbernard l kowalski was one great creative director no wonder that they later asked him to direct three more columbo movies the movie has some real creative and innovative shot sequences and the movie as a whole is also clearly made with style passion and eye for detail every shot connects and is a reason why this movie is better and also better looking just any other average made for tv movie it is definitely one of the better directed columbo moviesit is a quit original columbo entry for a couple of reasons the murder is more or less an accident and was an impulsive act so the killer this time does not have any time to plan out the perfect murder in advance and his to clean up any of the traces afterward and has to dispose the body the killer in this movie is not only being handled as the man who committed the crime but more as the man who helps out lieutenant columbo to solve the murder it makes the character a more interesting and layered one as well and also helps to make the way columbo solves the whole crime seem way more interesting as well because of that of course columbo starts to suspect him pretty early on and as always he comes to solution by making himself vulnerable and look more stupid than he of course truly is and by gaining the killers trust this is obviously no spoiler since this is the way every columbo movie gets setup i liked the story of the movie and how it progressedit also helps the movie that it has such a fine cast at the time of this movie peter falk had really made the columbo character his own and the character at this was already fully developed robert culp is truly great as the short tempered brimmer funny thing is that he would later star in three different columbo movies again and one mrs columbo episode only in totally different roles he even played the murderer in a couple of those movies as well again he by the way was not the only actor that did this in other later columbo movies also the great ray milland makes an appearance in this movie as the husband of the victimall in all a real great early columbo movie and among the better ones out of the long running series of moviesnineten,1
271,sandra bernhard is quite a character and certainly one of the funniest women on earth she began as a standup comedienne in the one thousand nine hundred and seventys but her big break came in one thousand nine hundred and eightythree when she starred opposite jerry lewis and robert de niro in scorseses underrated masterpiece the king of comedy her film career never quite took off though she did make a couple of odd but entertaining pictures such as dallas doll one thousand nine hundred and ninetyfour or dinner rush two thousand but the most amazing parts were those she created for herselfwithout you i am nothing is undoubtedly her best effort it is an adaptation of her smashhit offbroadway show which made her a superstar  and madonnas best friend for about four years in ten perfectly choreographed and staged scenes sandra turns from nina simone to diana ross talks about her childhood andy warhol and san francisco and performs songs made famous by burt bacharach prince or sylvester director john boskovich got sandra to do a ninetyminute tourdeforce performance that is both sexy and uniquely funny if you are a bernhard fan you cannot miss out this film it is a tribute as well to her weird beauty as to her extremely unconventional talent as a comedienne and it has influenced filmmakers in their work  hedwig and the angry inch for instance would look a lot different if without you i am nothing did not exist,1
272,picked this up for fifty cents at the flea market was pretty excitedi found it fascinating for about fifteen min then just repetitive and dullit is neat seeing mick and the gang in their prime i wish there was not so much over dubbing of dialog so i could hear what there are saying and playingthe skits are politically dated and incredibly naive and simple sort of poorly written monty python on acid i spent more time looking at the late sixtys england back drops rather then what was actually happening in the silly skitsthis movie is a good reminder that times really changeand what was important quickly becomes just plain silly good song but it has now been played to death by this dvd,0
273,i have just purchased the restored version of a film that i remember with much affection from childhood and it is certainly made for a curious afternoons entertainment bedknobs definitely makes more sense in its complete form the deleted scenes especially those with mcdowall link events together quite neatly what is a little disconcerting is the way the scenes have been remastered clearly the soundtrack to this footage had been lost or damaged so some bright spark at disney decided to dub the scenes with new dialogue which would have been great except that half the cast were not around to do it some for better reasons than others and the whole thing has a rather shoddy quality to it some of the lipsynching is pretty poor and david tomlinsons voice has been dubbed by a bloke who sounds absolutely nothing like david tomlinson there is actually a hint of german in it i think however good to hear the full versions of all the songs although step in the right direction is still absent and the moments of magic in this film still shine through and i challenge you not to giggle when young paul gazes so innocently at angela lansbury and coos but what is that got to do with my knob,1
274,i am decidedly not in the target audience for this film i am a man nearly fifty who has only recently stumbled across the world of independent film this happened quite by accident with the discovery of a movie called clerks late one night on television the first two things i noticed about that film were that it was one technically amateurish and two brilliantly written when i read an interview with the director in the local paper and he said that one of his influences was clerks i started to get interesting when he said his main influence was the station agent a movie i would seen on dvd a week prior i decided i had to go and check it out the result could be described along the same lines as clerks although the two films are nothing alike content wise both films suffer from technical gaffes that are overcome through amazing writing whereas clerks is a day in the life of a man who has nothing in his life at all and is afraid to ask tough questions about himself and his situation less like me is about a man who seemingly forces himself to be constantly busy he is always running one way or another filling his life with little things so that he will never have to deal with the big ones the themes and ideas of this film are strong and poignant i can tell from watching it that not much has changed since i was growing up young men still have the same problems they always have the writer dresses up these problems and themes in the modern vernacular crafts wonderfully honest characters and has them do completely believable things as far as indie cinema goes this may not be perfect from a technical standpoint but from an artistic one it is very close,1
275,i went into this movie after having read it was a drama about a man with a supernatural gift who was made into a monster by society suffice to say i was expecting something entirely different from what i got but it was a happy surprise my friend and i both thought the movie was very romantic the fact that the male lead is not bad to look at surely helped and there was enough plot development action and even humor the fact that it takes them until the threerd part of the movie to now each others name had the whole movietheatre laughing to keep you entertained and invested in the story so in short not what i expected but a very good surprise indeed i will definitely buy this movie when it comes out on dvd,1
276,on the back burner for years so it was reported this television reunion of two of the most beloved characters in sitcom history started off badly  and went straight downhill from there mary richards mary tyler moore and her best friend rhoda morgenstern valerie harper meet in new york after a long estrangement and catch up on each others lives what a novel concept but sad to relate nothing worth talking about let alone making a movie about has happened to either of them in the intervening years so instead the script contents itself with throwing out one hoary old plot device after another most having to do with older women in the workplace while completely missing the quirky charm and sophistication that made the original show a winner the supporting cast is instantly forgettable the humor is nonexistent and the chemistry which moore and harper once had together is gone moore allegedly stalled this project for years waiting for just the right script before committing herself if this was the one she considered right what on earth were the ones she turned down like it is not the age of the characters that does this in for time inevitably marches on but the almost complete lack of imagination coupled with a blatant disregard for the elements that made the series work at one time this was intended as a pilot but all to obviously it failed to generate any interest among potential sponsors or for that matter among potential audiences quickly and mercifully forgotten the film is a travesty and an insult to a classic,0
277,i think that this is possibly the funniest movie i have ever seen robert harlings script is near perfect just check out the quotes section on second thought just rent the dvd since it is the delivery that really makes the lines singsally field gives a comic overthetop performance like you have never seen from her anywhere else and kevin kline is effortlessly hilarious robert downey jr is typically brilliant and in a very small role kathy najimy is a riot as the beleaguered costumer i was never much of a fan of elisabeth shue but she is great here as the one real person surrounded by a bevy of cartoon characters on the set of the sun also sets  that rumbling you feel beneath you is hemingway rolling over in his grave either that or he is laughing really hardfive stars funny funny funny,1
278,monty berman and dennis spooner followed up the baron with this a fantasy series about three superhuman spies which preempted the six million dollar man it was a favourite of mine when i was a youngster and i enjoy watching it still stuart damon and william gaunt had an unmistakable onscreen chemistry as craig stirling and richard barrett while the luscious alexandra bastedo pouted her way through her role as sharron macready the late anthony nicholls made a wonderfully gruff tremayne by far the best episodes were those written by tony williamson terry nation and brian clemens while spooners own the interrogation compared favourably with the prisoner i regret that there was never a second series the concept had so much life left in it would craig and richard have been competitors for sharrons affections what if tremayne had learned of the champions powers did the champions have any other abilities other than those we saw we never found out alas,1
279,this film is definitely an odd love story though this film may not be much to shout about nicole kidman carries the film on her own the rest of the cast could quite easily be forgotten though ben chaplin does do quite a good job of hertfordshire life with shots of st albans  hemel hempstead town centre depicting the true essence of the area what starts outlooking like a regular episode of the popular british tv seriesheartbeat soon turns into a gritty gangster getaway action flicknothing truly memorable happens in this simple small film and thus endsup as fairly decent weekend entertainment a good one to watch and if you like the hero john are lonely thirty something you may find something to identify with in his character,1
280,i guess that everyone has to make a comeback at some point and that is exactly what embarrassed taft resident jack dundee robin williams intends to do in the best of times yep the man who went all crazy with the radio in good morning vietnam is playing football in this case he seeks to replay a game that cost his high school a prestigious title but exteammate reno hightower kurt russell is not just going to go along with it so easilygranted it is not the best movie for either man but williams and russell are actually a pretty good comedy team and some of the names in this movie are likely to give you the giggles to say the least check it out,1
281,please avoid this movie at all costs this is without a doubt the worst movie i have ever seen most movies have at least one redeeming value this has none totally horrible,0
282,in a summer that also boasted such repugnant stinkers as snakes on a plane and the da vinci code that is a pretty bold statement but i stand by it nonetheless superman returns like king kong six months before it is overlong hyperindulgent and with cgi up to the eyeballs my god this stuff is doing my head inrichard donner had the idea of keep it real for his two outings and i do find his approach to the special and optical effects to be the most appropriate brian singer bombards us with so much cgi that it really takes you out of the story and constantly reminds you that you are watching a wannabe blockbuster that thinks that the only way to impress an audience is to spend two hundred and fifty million a totally irresponsible amount of money on obnoxious visual effects that do not live up to the hype we have seen everything and been everywhere that cgi can take us there is no real atmosphere or involvement in this and for a film that is ninetyfive made up of this crapwell you figure it outi have read so many reviews from fanboy critics about how the movie has soul or a human heart or tender character moments puhlease we have already had brooding superheros silently screaming you would love me if you knew who i am dozens of times already in recent years and sr offers absolutely nothing new in this regard even the plot is recycled garbage lex luthor a seriously miscast and hammy kevin spacey plotting to destroy the landmass of america was done in the first film already and wellthat is your lot it is amazing that they managed to draw out this junk to twofive painful hours even if the cast were likable it would make it less unbearable but brandon routh has the on screen personality of a mahogany hatstand kate bosworth is completely unconvincing as a pulitzer prizewinning journalist james marsden is two hundred and fifty wooden as usual and kevin spacey really needs to either fire his agent or acquire some better judgement the only cast member i liked was the lovely parker posey but i am into weirdlooking girlsevery year films like this get bigger and more bombastic pretty soon we will have three hundred million films studios need to realise that maybe they should start looking down instead of looking up for all the money that warner spent on this pile of crap for all the resources that this movie cost to makewas it worth it in my opinion certainly not this garbage has put me of superman for life,0
283,i had just reached thirteen when i first saw this series and i am watching it again on dvd over thirty years later the pictures over the opening credits have never left me it has affected my view of the world and the peoples in it my parents were with me long enough to have seen the series with me and we always discussed the programme afterwards it gave me a love for studying history and the highest marks i got in our schools public examssir laurence oliviers voice and delivery is timeless and perfect i get the feeling that the people who lived through it would feel that this is their version of the history of the second world war i cannot imagine ever getting bored looking at it maybe an similar cold war series could now be contemplated although who could replace sir laurence is difficult to imaginebuy it,1
284,mario lewis of the competitive enterprise institute has written a definitive one hundred and twentypage pointbypoint linebyline refutation of this mendacious film which should be titled a convenient lie the website address where his debunking report which is titled a skeptics guide to an inconvenient truth can be found at is  a shorter tenpage version can be found at  once you read those demolitions you will realize that alleged global warming is no more real or dangerous than the ytwok scare of one thousand nine hundred and ninetynine which gore also endorsed as he did the pseudoscientific film the day after tomorrow which was based on a book written by alleged ufo abductee whitley strieber as james the amazing randi does to psychics and philip klass does to ufos and gerald posner does to jfk conspiridiocy theories so does mario lewis does to al gores movie and the whole global warming scam,0
285,scott henderson alan curtis is unjustly accused of killing his unfaithful wife the night she was murdered he was out with a mystery woman who refused to give him her name after accused of the murder the police visit all the places he had been with her but people only remember him being alone he is sentenced to die and his secretary ella raines sets out to find the murderer herself because she loves himthis was made as a b film from universal look at the castall character actors and one starfranchot toneon the decline the budget was small and the cast mostly unknown but what came out is one of the best film noirs of the one thousand nine hundred and fortys it is beautifully directed by curt siodmak and has a fantastic script that came from an excellent book by william irish a pen name for cornell woolrich it moves quickly and just looks fantastic and there is the infamous jam session with raines and elisha cook jr which just comes off the screen with incredible sexual energy i am surprised the censors did not cut itthere are only a few flaws that prevent this from being perfect tone gives a dreadful performance he looks ghastly and he is just horrible also curtis is stiff and bland as henderson you really wonder why raines loves himhe is so unemotional but raines is pretty good in the lead role she is pretty and full of life also the last scene when the murderer is after her never rings true he is hardly a threat physically and her reactions just seem overstatedstill i am giving this a nine a really great filmflaws aside,1
286,whoever gave this movie rave reviews needs to see more moviesa loser takes his camera and photographs his mental family the movie is filled with idiots and includes live teabagging that should sum it all up for youdo not waste your time you may want to watch the entire movie in the hopes that it gets better as it goes on  it does not,0
287,i was really excited about seeing this film i thought finally australia had made a good film but i was wrongthis was the most pathetic attempt at a slasher film ever i feel sorry for molly ringwald having to come all the way to australia to make an awful moviethe acting was terrible especially that australian guy who was trying to speak in an american accent and the plot was also pretty badwhen i first heard about this film coming out i thought that the title was pathetic because it sounds like the cheesy film stab in scream two but i was willing to let it slide if it was a good moviewarning major spoilersprobably the worst thing about the film was the ending i was expecting a big surprise about who the killer was but the killer was not even human which turned this realistic slasher film into an awful horror moviedo not see this film you will probably be disappointed,1
288,of the three remakes of this plot i like them all i have all three on vhs and in addition have a copy of this one on dvd there is just enough variation in the scripts to make all three entertaining and rewatchable in addition has any other film been remade three times with such all star casts in each of course the main stars in this one are great but the supporting actors are also superb i particularly like william tracy as pepi he was such a scene stealer that i have searched to find other movies he is in he appeared in many but most are not available as the other comments i also say  buy this one,1
289,if this film had a budget of twenty million i would just like to know where the money went a monkey could make better cgi effects then what was wasted for three hours on this dreadful piece of garbage although i must admit the machines and the martians would have looked really really cool on an original playstation one game and early pc games from the mid ninetys if a game had ever been made what puzzles me is where did the money go pendragon films could have made a great film with good old fashioned models and computer controlled cameras a la george lucas circa one thousand nine hundred and seventyfiveeightythree and actors who actually look like they care about what they are doing or ruining in this case for about the same twenty million this is quite possibly the worst film ever made i would rather sit through a twentyfour hour repeat screening of ishtar than watch this film again i hated it completely i regress i say this is the worst film ever made because unlike other bad movies like plan nine or killer tomatoes or santa claus conquers the martians these are films that are so bad you have a special place in your heart for them you love them there is no love for this film and no place in my dvd library for it i sold it to a guy for a dollar i am betting the money for the film was spent on booze and other vices for the cast and crew shame on you pendragon films i want my money back,0

292,i love watching early colour films  you mean those fortys clothes were not all grey margaret rutherford dominates this movie her eccentric garb is actually rather attractive and yes she has an amazing hourglass figure but i feel she was given her head rather too much she probably developed this characterisation over many performances and nobody told her if it gets a laugh leave it out she does too much deranged fooling about when she is supposed to be surprisingly down to earth the madame arcati joke is that mediums were usually portrayed as wispy females in long drapery arcati behaves like a retired headmistress we will really put our backs into it the contrast between her breezy commonplace manner and her wacky beliefs is not really brought outjust because all the actors are english apart from cummings the americans feel they have to use the words brit stiff lip and upper oh give it a rest the three main characters lose their tempers constantly and make risqué remarks did he make love to you yes but very discreetly  he was in the cavalry,0
293,a fantastic show and an unrealized classic the league of gentlemen remains as one of the greatest modern comedies of recent timeswith a dark and bizarre style of humor that towers over the tired formulaic approach of it is inferior yet unfortunately far more acknowledged successor little britain the league of gentlemen was truly something special during a rather quiet era in british comedyup until it is arrival on the scene there had never really been anything like the league of gentlemen before on the surface a seemingly simplistic sketch show the show soon unfolds as a vivid sinister but incredibly hilarious universe populated with all manner of brilliant comedic creations what really sets the show apart from it is rivals is it is approach to telling us it is story rather than serve us rehashed sketches barely distinguishable from the next here we see each individual or group of characters go through their various journeys and story lines no visit to them is the same and each time they offer us up with a surprisegradually over three series and a christmas special the fictional town of royston vasey is heaving with a grotesque yet hilarious populace and that is probably the main reason why the show is such a joy to watch and also the reason why the show would easily merit more series unlike other current shows like the catherine tate show or more importantly little britain the league both know when a character has run it is course and have the opportunity to deal with that several fan favorites who could have easily been kept on to entertain further bowed out before the series came to a close giving room for fellow characters to grow more or allow for the introduction of newer residents of royston vasey to make their markanother thing that sets this show above others is that the writing team approach the script process with care and intelligence as mentioned before all four members of the league have a sound mind when it comes to judging the longevity of their creations and when it is time to call it quits in respect to certain characters this awareness has also meant the league of gentlemen undergoes a bold evolution not usually seen in a show of this nature the narrative driven and far darker third series is a brave step away from the more sketch based first two series and this bold move by the league really pays off with the third series there is less of an urgency for them to please an audience and like the christmas special they pursue individual stories with a clear narrative unlike the more sketchbased previous series that succesfully binded together various sets of sketches into a series long story arcthe third series is both a refreshing change of pace of style as well as a real treat for fans who have already seen the first two despite some polarized opinion on the third series any real fan of the league will appreciate what the third series has to offer as well as really enjoy the more character based episodes that only delve deeper into fan favorites but pair up and interwine characters that might not have crossed paths previouslyit might take a little trying to get into the change in style but it is definitely worth it and in my opinion the third series is the best and also provides a firm conclusion to the seriesthe shows not without it is drawbacks and very occasionally certain characters and set pieces appear somewhat out of place but for the most part the genius writing dark nature of the show and the host of brilliant characters that are often all too close to real life make for a real treat and prove what comedy should be about and puts much of the more recent catch phrase driven and often desperate attempts at comedy to shame,1
294,as other reviewers have noted the film dies in the last onetwo hour however before that it suffers from predictability and a stunningly vapid performance by kate capshaw who clearly never found her character and ruins every scene she is in connery is fine as is fishbourne but most scenes are manipulated for effect rather than truth which overlays the entirety with a sense of unreality and the ending is simply bizarre the film makers apparently knew when they pieced this mess together that all they needed were sweet potatoes and pumpkin pie to have thanksgiving dinner so to compensate they added an overloud dramatic score every little jump is accompanied by a crescendo of orchestration to the point where it becomes laughable if you want an example of major league bad film this is one to see otherwise skip it,0
295,ettore scola is one of the most important italian directors my parents and i watched together ceravamo tanto amati on a summer night we liked it but we did not love it as we loved a special day i believe ettore scola is pretty underrated we often forget to remember him maybe because his latest films were disappointing and so yesterday night my mum and i sat on our sofa to enjoy this masterpiece writing direction cinematography score and production design were sober and accurate but the thing i liked the most was the chemistry between loren and mastroianni they are both excellent actors and play the main roles of antonietta and gabriele antonietta is an housewife married with a fanatic fascist she has six children but her husband wants to have another child to get a prize for the huge families gabriele is simply an antifascist they spend together a special day that special day of one thousand nine hundred and thirtyeight when hitler came to rome visiting mussolini i do not want to spoil anymore about the plot go looking for this film,1
296,like the first touch of pleasure and guilt like a spontaneous youthful flirt of fascination and fear like a climax of contrary emotions said one of the movie buffs after viewing love at the top the misinterpreted title version of stylish director michel devilles le mouton enrage vincent canby in new york times however just after the one thousand nine hundred and seventyfour premiere of the movie stated love at the top which opened yesterday at the sixtyeightth street playhouse is a one thousand nine hundred and seventythree french comedy that dimly recalls a number of nineteenfifties english comedies about the rise and rise of cynical young men possessingand possessed byambition yet the significant difference that he mentioned was the fact that love at the top is not concerned with the english class systemjanuary twentyseven one thousand nine hundred and seventyfivehaving left the evaluations up to single individuals of course the test of time has done its just job what may be said with certainty after more than thirty years is that we can hardly find such movies like le mouton enrage where decadence appears innocent where liaisons appear youthfully enthusiastic where feelings occur so manipulative for romy schneiders fans it seems useless to point out that this film is a must see not only because she gives a unique performance as she did in all of her roles at the heyday of her career nine years before her sudden death but because she is particularly attractive here it is not trio infernal where the so to say forced escape from and the mockery of romys sweet image haunted for years by saccharine sissi meets its most discouraging manifestation but a film where the brilliant actress is given a fair role she plays roberte a woman who becomes the object of lust for the storys lead playboy nicolas mallet jean louis trintignant it is him who takes financial profits from lustful liaisons this movie can boast truly memorable and unique shots of romy and she is given some of her very best scenes romys sex appeal is unforgettable hereanother strong point of the film is its execution of the content with a development of individual perception immoral as it may seem the director makes a perfect use of contrast conventions vs pleasures innocence vs decadence genuine lust vs instrumental affair nicola owns most of the features that viewers may like or detest may find attractive or disgusting yet his are the features the viewers must treat seriously more to say they are the ones we all must accept that is why one is led to a peculiar gently wild erotically unique world of the main character although he sleeps with lots of women there are two women that represent a sort of contrary worlds for nicola roberte groult romy schneider and mariepaul jane birkin he manipulates them makes love to them cannot refrain from both desire for their bodies and desire for money yet he perceives them differently yet despite all of this adult maturity he is emotionally like a little boy who plays with a toycar on the table  a sort of detailed insight into male mind in a comedylike way of coursefinally there are very good performances which makes le mouton enrage slightly underrated not only the aforementioned romy schneider does a brilliant job supplying the viewers with an extraordinary insight into her role but young jane birkin appears to be convincing in the role of young inexperienced streetwalker marie paul jean louis trintignant makes it possible to see nicola in the right way this artistic merit lying in performances goes with terrific music by camille saintsaëns the tune that will ring in your ears for long therefore apart from some flaws of the movie like dated colors slow action sometimes possible clichés noticed by some viewers the merits should be found significant le mouton enrage in sum is a clear manifestation of contrary manipulative tools in life it is worth seeing as a moment in romys career a prelude to strong eroticism a chain of contrary emotions of love and hatred appreciation and disgust compared to the first orgasm and the first angasm but are not we humans viewers movie buffs built upon such contrasts,1
297,a somewhat dull made for tv movie which premiered on the tbs cable station antonio and janine run around chasing a killer computer virus andthat is about it for trivia buffs this will be noted as debuting the same weekend that the real life melissa virus also made it is debut in email inboxes across the world,0
298,some films are so bad that they are good this is clearly not one of them based on a true story this film was about as true to the story as pinocchios chances of becoming a real boy the acting was terrible the direction was poor and it travelled way too fast it was as if the director just wanted to get it over and done with and go homenor did melissa joan hart ever strike me as a talented actress but then every film she made was pretty lowbudget anyway like most of her other films she let us down her characters by hamming them up too much talking too quickly as if speeding up her words is going to make her more dramatic she really brings out the sense that there is a crew in front of her and she is talking to a camera when she should be engaging the viewer in her character it pretty much let us down the whole film and any leg that it may have had left to stand on is ruinedprobably the only good thing about the film is when she got nailed in the end but even that was not satisfying enough to subdue my loathing for such a bad filmwatch it if your taste in film is blander than a piece of dry toast,0
299,this is complete and absolute garbage a fine example of what a bad movie is like this cannot be appealing to anyone not even bmovie fans do not i repeat do not waste precious time of your life on this piece of trash bad acting bad directing horrible but i mean really horrible script and complete lack of an idea as to what entertainment of any form is i bought the dvd for three dollars i swear i could almost pay someone to take it burning it would not be enough for what this movie did to me i like bmovies the killer toys the weird lagoon monsters but this is nowhere near you know those movies that are so bad they are funny not even just plain old pathetic,0
300,caught this film in about one thousand nine hundred and ninety on video by chance and without knowing what i was in for many horror fans may have missed this thinking it was a typical prison film and the ones who did get it did not like it as it was not what they wanted to see the above mentioned factors are probably the reasons it is low rated but just ignore that and give it a whirl if you are a fan of the genreit has strong suits in all departments from script and atmosphere to acting and the prison itself an absolute diamond a film i still have on video to this day check it out,1
301,fiftytwopick up never got the respect it should have it works on many levels and has a complicated but followable plot the actors involved give some of their finest performances annmargret roy scheider and john glover are perfectly cast and provide deep character portrayals notable too are vanity who should have parlayed this into a serious acting career given the unexpected ability she shows and kelly preston who is character will haunt you for a few days anyone who likes action combined with a gritty complicated story will enjoy this,1
302,i was not sure at first if i was watching a documentary propaganda film or dramatic presentation i guess given the time of production it was a mix of all threeadmittedly the dramatic plot was somewhat predictable but you had a sense that there would be some interesting scenes as the movie went on we were able to witness what appeared to be realistic training regimens and equipmentwhere this movie came together for me was closer to the end the scenes had a realism at least as i perceived it that i have not encountered often before you could place yourself in the action and imagine the thoughts of the young combatants this was mixed in with the usual problems of portraying passable japanese soldiers at a time when you might think real japanese actors would be somewhat scarcethe movie is excellent as a source of the state of the american mindset in one thousand nine hundred and fortythree as the war waged with japan also of interest was a dig at the japanese with respect to the help the usa gave japan in past years,1
303,i am not usually one to slate a film  i try to see the good points and not focus on the bad ones but in this case there are almost no good points in my opinion if you are going to make something that bad why bother part of the film is take up with shots of annes face while she breaths deeply and violin music plays in the background the other part is filled with poor and wooden acting rupert penry jones is expressionless jennifer higham plays annes younger sister with modern mannerisms anne is portrayed as being meek and self effacing which is fine at the beginning but she stays the same all through the film and you see no reason for captain wentworth to fall in love with her overall the production lacks any sense of period with too many mistakes to be overlooked such as running out of the concert kissing in the street running about in the streets with no hat on why was this scene in the film at all the scene in the book was one of the most romantic scenes written to sum it up a terrible film very disappointing,0
304,full marks for pacinos rendering of the speech over the dead kids coffin shakespeares mark antony would be put to shamewas it paul schrader or was it ken lipper who should be complimented on the remarkable dialogues they are rich and intelligent and well worth your time if you like movies with good scripts i found the story narrative developing quite well right up to the voiceover postscriptthere is little else to talk about in this film even john cusack has done better roles than this one interestingly the film is very male orientedthe women are mere appendages,1
305,seven if you are a kid six if you claim to be an adult this semisequel to the lion king sees to spin off side characters timone and pumba retelling the original story through their eyes including the story of how they met in the grand tradition of disney inferior sequels are made and occasionally tv series featuring the adventures of minor characters from their biggest hits you can be as sceptical as you want about this but kids and fans of the series will likely not care their are enough jokes and songs and interesting things to ensure that this is one of the few above average sequels this works because of the charm of the muchloved central characters the quick pace the injokes involving the first film and for older viewers there are some funny gags the animation is as good as ever if a little less flamboyant than the original but the plot here is all about taking it easy hakuna matatatimone and pumba decide to watch the events of the first film frequently stopping midfilm to joke about parts of it like a real audience we see how timone is a near outcast he feels he does not fit in and decides to go looking beyond what he sees to find his ideal home on the way he meets pumba another outcast and they become friends soon they meet simba a lion cub natural predator of t and p but they form a trio however when simba realises he must follow his own destiny and leave the group it is up to the others to decide whether to help or not and how of course the usual disney elements and themes are here friendship good versus evil etc the plot is simple but works on many levels making it smarter than your average animated movie as the cg movies appear disneys traditional form must become smarter but not forget the roots which made them popular toy story and all that have come since have been clever with jokes to suit all ages and it seems this is the way the market is shifting however there will always be a place for films like this and you cannot go wrong buying this for the youngstersseven out of ten,1
306,the summer has been so full of blockbusters and comebacks of films and not to mention some of the disappointments of those comebacks that i was woe to find a film i could just sit down and enjoy in case you do not want to read further down the page there are not any spoilers i will sum it up here it is more mature than ella enchanted there are some questionably violent parts plenty of death and a handful of scenes with a little blood not for small children but does not try to be overly corny or overstep its bounds think of it as a bit more serious bit more magical princess bride and you will be close i am perhaps not as prodigious a movie goer as others maybe once or twice a month if i feel active i am also a huge scififantasy fan i get bored of remade repetitive story lines and films with more flash than filling faster than you can count to ten and this film is the diamond in the roughby the end here august i was tired enough of fractured expectations from the big hits that i averted seeing bourne ultimatum in favor of stardust having had my hopes thoroughly muddied by transformers for my fiction addiction the previews of stardust seemed appealing but i was certainly waryas many others here i was utterly surprised i had gone in thinking to see another generic fantasy movie clichéd from here to breakfast do not be fooled it is most definitely a fairytale and it does indeed have witches magic and utterly requires suspension of disbelief but the most refreshing thing i found is that it is not based on anything i have seen or read in the past fifteen years and it is actually a really good movieunlike ninety of the other movies which seem to persistently reappear like thorns in a side perhaps a sign that hollywood is running out of ideas i could read a book this year and in two years the movie would be out as another epic fantasy tale the likes of lotr and the rest so says the nyt and such and such no doubtstardust did not have me bolted to my seat because of jampacked action at every turn nor was i sweating bullets because of plothook after plothook threatening to tear the dramatic tension apart and echo throughout the theater in a loud boom it did not even use enormous blasts of sound to grab my attention to what is happening on screen transformers i am looking at you it is not trying to show off the latest cgi techniques nor did it offend my intelligence with dimwitted dialogs and story lines that are simple enough i could have figured them out in threerd grade boy i hate those i just watched watched and enjoyed a refreshingly creative storyline unfold before my eyes sure i may have known what was going to happen throughout most of the film but it makes you forget that it even made my heart twinge at some parts but the most important aspect i noticed is that i left the theater feeling better than when i would gone init truly is a gem after so much slush this summer with so many remakes and films that fell short of my expectations this was like a cold sweet cup of tea to cap off all the hard work i would done sitting through the others trying to come out of them with my moneys worthit is probably not for everyone but do yourself a favor if you enjoy fantasy films that stand the test of time alone princess bride black cauldron the dark crystal etc then you should really see this movie this little diamond is finding its way into my dvd collection the moment it hits stores you can trust me on thissimply wonderful,1
307,michael stearns plays mike a sexually frustrated individual with an interesting moral attitude towards sexuality he has no problem ogling naked dancers but when women start having sex with men that is when he loses it he believes that when women actually have sex that is when they lose any sense of innocence andor beauty so he strolls through the hollywood hills stalking lovemaking couples at a distance ultimately shooting the men dead with a highpowered rifle with a scopethe seeming primary reason for this movies existence is to indulge in sexual activity over and over again the story comes off as more of an afterthought this is bound to make many a happily heterosexual male quite pleased as we are treated to enough protracted scenes of nudity the ladies here look awfully good sans clothes and sex to serve as a major dose of titillation of course seeing a fair deal of it through a scope ups the creepiness factor considerably and illustrates the compulsion towards voyeurism for one thing mike eyes the couples through the scope for minutes at a time before finally pulling the trigger this is all underscored by awfully intrusive if somewhat atmospheric music on the soundtrackthose with a penchant for lurid trash are bound to enjoy this to one degree or another it even includes one lesbian tryst that confounds mike and renders him uncertain how to react it unfolds at a very slow pace but wraps up with a most amusing ironic twist it is a kinky and twisted rarity that if nothing else is going to definitely keep some viewers glued to the screenseventen,1
308,to summarize this movie without a real plot this movie consists of eighty minutes of deranged characters either drinking or making bad jokes the music is just awful the humor is not funny and all the female characters slutty idiots or total geeks it seems to me that the movie has actually been written by a fourteen year old boy who thinks that drinking is cool women are designed to please men and all that oppose that view are geeks also the movie has nothing to do with the original american pie movies other than a few names and mr levenstein who is a minor character in this one the only good thing about this movie are the nice looking girls do not watch this movie and do not be fooled by the fivefour rating because it obviously overrated and does not deserve anything above two,0
309,trailers of this movie may show scenes of violence or non mainstream sexuality but these scenes are just rare fragments picked out to attract audience they are of course showing the main message of the moviepeople who are constantly kicked on their heads in their jobs and lives using power which they may have somewhere else to notoriously oppress others and at the low end of the oppression chain mostly womena movie showing this as brutally as hundstage is surely tough to face but having to endure such lives is even toughertechnically the film is much like short cuts but consisting of documentary style episodes featuring people like your neighbour playing just the way they are without any glitter and most disturbingly without any hope its documentary style makes the movie even more disturbing because you realize such people are out there and there are many of them although our society focuses on the nice exterior looks somewhere the porn industry has to do its business somewhere unreported domestic violence has to take place somewhere hopes have to shatter i sure do know such peopleif you want to see a movie without any funny scenes some may think the handicapped woman repeating the top ten supermarkets is funny but this happens for real and without any melodramatic go watch this movie however it will lose when you are focusing on subtitles i fear as subtitles can´t transport accentuation,1
310,bogmeister and others have pretty much nailed this shore leave is really tos first attempt at lightweight scifi which they would later perfect with the classic trouble with tribbles it gave both the crew of the enterprise and its tv viewers a needed respite from the universe threatening consequences of for example the corbomite manoueverlooking for a place to chill out for a while the enterprise happens across a seemingly idyllic m class planet and sends an exploratory team down to take a closer look soon enough all kinds of absurdities begin to take place  some seemingly perilous  but it all seems a morass of human emotional extremities played out in a weird blend of fantastic mystery mccoy has gone through the looking glass psychological thriller kirk is stalked by an indefatigable bully from his past and romantic comedy no commenttos was the least serialized of all of the series in the trek franchise so it is easy to forget how many episodes in the first season focused on heavyhanded potentially calamitous drama unlike later series franchise writers tos production team was not afraid to literally go where no tv series had gone before and shore leave despite its occasional problems is an example my only criticism of this episode is that the cast particularly shatner  ironic given his legendary sense of humor did not seem to know how to handle this new wrinkle on sts themes the last scene is possibly one of the worst scenes i can remember from the entire tos run  both compositionally and in terms of actingnuff said my recommendation  see it while watching the entire first season as it was meant to be seen  it order,1
311,did heidijean really see this movie a great christmas movie not even close dull bland and completely lacking in imagination and heart i kept watching this movie wondering who the hell thought that carly pope could play the lead in this movie the woman has no detectable personality and gives a completely lackluster performance baransky was great as usual and provided the only modicum of interesting the whole thing probably her involvement was the only reason this project was green lighted to begin with maybe i am expecting too much for a lifetime movie played fifteen days from christmas but i sat through this thing thinking that with a different director and a recasting jj with an actress that at least could elicit sympathy this could have been quite a cute little movie,0
312,the film starts with a voice over telling the audience where they are and who the characters are and that is the moment i started to dislike the movie with all the endless possibilities any film director have in hand i really find it a very easy and cheap solution to express the situation with a voice over telling everything i actually believe voice overs are betrayals to the film making concepti hate to hear from a voice over saying where we are which date we are at and especially what the characters feel and think i believe that a director has to find a visual way to transmit the feelings and the thoughts of the characters to the audience but after the bad influencing intro a very striking movie begins and keeps going for a fairly long enough time the lives of a middle class family and all the members individually are depicted in a perfect realistic way i think the director has a talent for capturing real life situations for example a father who has to make his private calls from the bathroom might seem abnormal at first but life itself leads us some situations which might seem abnormal but also very normal as well i think the director is a very good observer about real lifebut that is it after a while the realism in the movie begins to sacrifice the storytelling i really felt like i am having a big headache because of the nonstop talking characters it was as if the actors and actresses were given the subject and were allowed to improvise the dialogs it is realistic really but characters always asking really is that so etc to each other or characters saying no or are you listening to me ten times when saying it only once is just enough causes me to have a headachei also think the play practicing and book reading scenes are more then they should be i understand that the play and the book in the movie are very much related to the plot but i think the director has missed the point where he should stop showing these scenes,0
313,i did not know it was possible to release a movie this bad the labeling sounded so promising but you would think that with a cast of twenty at least one of them would be able to act my wife left me and went to bed after the first twenty minutes she made a wise decision,0
314,the film is very complete in what it is keeping one continuously interested with the flashbacks to childhood and growing up with such a bizarre father and interspersing it with the tails of serial murder one simply cannot go wrong the very plot in itself the very story and essence of the film is entertaining it is the sort of story that the director bill paxton could do so much with and in this case he really did do a lot with itfrom beginning to end you are kept anticipating more and more about what is happening and where the film is going and the creativity that is behind this story is first class i felt as if this film was exquisitely done from start to finish and one of those rare gems that seemed to be without any boring lulls  the action flowing neatly quickly and tightly from one scene to the next it demonstrates just how far people can go so as to do such horrible things to their loved ones and to do such acts of evil in the name of god when they are disillusioned as in this case it also is sometimes interesting in its twists  takes on the concept of morality as a wholeoverall this is the sort of film that one easily overlooks but i would recommend you to not do likewise and to check this film out  it is very much so worth your time,1
315,i understand the jokes quite well they just are not good the show is horrible i understand it and that is another horrible thing about it the only cool character there ever was on the show was that one hobo in that one episode but then i see the other episode including that episode and the show is horrible it is not funny not funny i do not want people to say only smart people get it because if they are so smart why do they judge people they do not even know and say that they are not smart or intellectual enough to understand it it is like saying the sky is red but never looking outside but anyways this is absolutely the worst show i have ever seen in my life the jokes are terrible i mean you can understand them they are just horrible her controversy is very lame her fart jokes and other jokes on bodily fluids are really dumb and usually consist of really bad acting i am not sure what these smart people see in this show but judging others when they do not even know anything about any of us is not exactly a smart comment,0
316,there are too many new styles of the sitcom but the one that works best is the old fashioned way with an audience and indoor set that seventys show is a great example when the show came on the air nobody really heard of kurtwood smith and debra jo rupp much less the adolescents played wonderfully by topher grace and ashton kushton both of them are leaving the show this year to pursue other interests i wish topher would stay around because the show began about his character eric and his close circle of friends ashton is already the john travolta of our time remember when john was in love with diana hyland from eight is enough think of ashton with demi moore the cast of actors were never known to us which is a good thing because a celebrity cast member can spoil it i miss mo gaffney who played dons girlfriend joanne i miss lisa robin kelly as the original laurie the replacement could not match her and i am sorry about that i liked the casting of tommy chong as the wasted but beloved father figure to steven hyde i loved watching tanya roberts besides charlies angels i loved brooke shields playing jackies mom she really showed her acting talent before heading to broadway this show has been a delight with many surprises i hope this show lasts longer even though two of their cast members are leaving but i hope they do not stay too far away too long i wish the shows creators bonnie and terry turner who also created my other favorite show third rock from the sun is more successful on fox than they were on nbc which sabotaged their show the turners are not dummies and i hope they create more shows like this in the future,1
317,i would give it a twoteni was really really disappointedthe storyline was poorly developed for instance the incidents were too short and brief hence the moral was not clearly brought out i thought brenda song did a fine job but shin koyamada seemed to have a difficult time handling his role i could see the need to put in western elements in the show however there are certain parts where chinese elements were needed too the villain for example his physical appearance resembled a robot instead of something out of the chinese culture the final and the worst flaw were the incorrect and distorted facts placed in the showothers may point out that this is a kids show and hence there is no need for the such high standards however there are other disney shows such as mu lan which have been much better in terms of story development and presentationin conclusion i feel that disney movies should be better researched and better planned a good show is not enough with just a series of martial arts moves to depend on,0
318,anyone who finds this film boring is a hopeless bonehead who should stick to car chase movies and romantic comedies this film is riveting and does not have a boring moment why because it is comprised largely of intelligent dialogue between real people in a moment of crisis and details their efforts to survive that crisis i repeatintelligent dialogue that is what characterizes nearly all of rohmers films and that is why a lot of people do not like them they prefer action fine let them spend the rest of their lives watching action films while those of us with taste and discrimination will continue to seek out films like thisrohmer has always been accused of being talky well he is but to me that is a compliment not a criticism shakespeare was talky too is there a talkier play than hamlet whenever the subject or theme of a work of art consists of ideas and conflicts over values there must of necessity be a discussion of these ideas and values an that is largely what this film is all about aristocracy and noble birth vs egalitarianism loyalty to old friends that is put to the ultimate test when that friend takes what we believe to be a wrong path the value of human life and the responsibility to help save that life even if the person possessing that life is not so nice or even despicable anyone ever hear of dostoyevsky or crime and punishment these are what this film is all aboutthe two leads in this film are impeccable as if they were born to play these roles lucy russell who is english and speaks french as her second language is especially brilliant do yourself a favor and see this riveting film it may be the last film by this screen master,1
319,without wishing to be a killjoy brad sykes is responsible for at least two of the most dull and clichéd films i have ever seen  this being one of them and camp blood being another the acting is terrible the print is shoddy and everything about this film screams seriously you could do better yourself maybe this is a challenge to everyone to saturate youtube with our own zombie related crapi bought this for £one but remember you cannot put a price on seventyone minutes of your life you would do well to avoid this turkey even at a bargain basement price,0
320,you have heard it said to live every moment as if it is your last whether it is your last day or not i beg you not to waste any part of it watching this nichole hiltz provides some nice moments of eye candy that alas stays wrapped and david deluise shows why he should stick to the small screen or dog food commercials a shallow unrealistic plot with dreadful dialogue means there is no art in the art of revenge,0
321,i saw a special advance screening of this today i have to let you know i am not a huge fan of either dane cook or steve carell so i really had no expectations going into this i ended up enjoying it quite a bitdan in real life is the story of a widower with three daughters who goes to spend a weekend with his family while at a bookstore he meets the woman of his dreams only to find out that she happens to be his brothers girlfriendthis movie is pretty well made the soundtrack cinematography and acting are all topnotch especially steve carell my problem with it was mostly that there seemed to be a lack of character development mostly with dane cooks character we never really get a close look at the relationship between dane and steves characters and i felt that it could have helped a bit in showing what dans inner conflict about being in love with danes girlfriend was like other than this though dan in real life is definitely a solid sweet film definitely a nice break from all the horror and action movies we have been getting this year,1
322,there is one good thing in this movie lola glaudinis ass sorry to be so blunt but it is the truth too bad she did not do a nude it would at least have made this mess tolerable we see another chicks boobs but she is nowhere near lola and man is armand assante old or what the man looks like crap consequence is the usual bmovie you would expect the story had potential it is like they had good ideas but did not know how to execute them the cinematography is just plain awful ugly the directing is uninspired and the end result is a bland thriller with lame twists and washed up actors lola gaudini is great as the vixen in a cheap slutty way but not even she saves consequence from being trash and not funny trash just plain old stinking trash,0
323,i read the comment of chrismgrant from united stateshe wrote   a fantastic documentary of one thousand nine hundred and twentyfour this early twentyth century geography of todays iraq was powerfuli would like to thank chris and people who are interested in bakhtiari nomads of iran the zagros mountains and landscapes and have watched the movie grass a nations battle for life these traditions you saw in the movie have endured for centuries and will go on as long as life endures i am from this region of iran myself i am a bakhtiari chris i am sorry to bother you but bakhtiari region of zardkuh is in iran not in irak as you mentioned in your comment iran and irak are two different and distinct countries taking an iranian for an irankian is almost like taking an american for an mexican thanksziba,0
324,would someone tell shaq to stick to what he is good at basketball this movie was not even entertaining on a stupid level in this movie shaq plays a genie who lives in a boom box is that not orginal a genie in a boom box instead of a lamp he is supposed to help a little boy played by the equally annoying francais cappra this movie had the most flimsy storyline since water world the acting was awful and i think that anyone who likes this flim would be afraid to admit it,0
325,may and her husband go to visit their children and grandchildren the visit is awkward because the grandchildren and kids do not really seem to know each other as one might expect the warmth that should be there is missing after dinner mays husband says he does not feel well blames it on his daughters cooking and irritably says he wants to go home he dies that nightmay now a widow is lost she clearly did not have a passionate marriage or a very interesting one but she had a purpose she had someone who needed her and even though her own needs had gone unmet for years she had something to do with her daysshe is depressed and unmotivated she goes to stay with her daughter paula who shortly after her mothers arrival let us her mother know that she has never felt that her mother has given much of herself at all she let us loose with anger over her mothers lack of nurturing may seems disarmed and surprised yet she also does not seem to have the energy or the desire to really make it right i am your mother and i love you what does really say i have heard this from my own mother way too many times and have yet to figure out what it means paula is a bit well more than a bit neurotic both women are needy though they show it very differentlypaula has been involved with a friend of her sons darren who is a handyman working on the house owned by her son while paula is working during the day may begins to have conversations and lunches with darren darren is a married man who has stayed with his wife because of their autistic son nicky but supposedly does not live in the home with his wifemay becomes attracted to darren because he is virile and she enjoys the connection they seem to have darren becomes attracted to may because she offers a kind of peace and understanding that he does not get from the other women in his life he also becomes too interested in money that may says she can give him to get away from it all though he is clearly not interested in her desire to join him on such a journey they end up sleeping together in the spare room during the day and may enjoys fulfillment as a woman that she has not known in years nor had ever expected to know again as her daughter paula had often told her that she would leave the married darren this becomes part of mays rationalization that what she is doing is okayat a writing group that paula leads may is introduced rather forced to get together with a widower to whom she is not attracted there is one scene where she has sex with the older man who clearly can barely perform and it truly painful and unsettling as we see the total disgust on mays face as she endures the onetime ghastly liaisoneventually paula discovers through some very graphic sketches done by her mother that indeed her mother and darren have been having sexthis film will undoubtedly be seen by many in myriad ways sympathies will be divided at one point during paulas writing group may reveals through a short essay that she used to feel as though she hated her kids by the end of the day and would leave for pubs after they were asleep making sure to get back home before her husbandclearly a good mother does not think of leaving children alone while she goes off to the local pub may however also had revealed earlier in the film that her husband did not like her having any friends so she did not have any she did what he wanted her to do she was miserable but she put up with it because as she said it was easier so while may was not the best mother for those inclined to have any sympathy for her one might see mays actions as the act of a woman just wanting to be sexual and to be a live for a few minutes in her lifetime a woman who just wanted someone to listen to her to know her as a human being to have a friend and a loverpaula though neurotic and unhappy perhaps has become that way because of the distant parents who raised her certainly it is not difficult to understand why paula feels completely betrayed by her motherit is a welldone film with more complexities than i have mentioned and certainly one that will leave the viewer with many perhaps conflicting reactions it is a film worth discussing and debating and above all worth seeingone thing the film leaves us with is the horror and fear of a lonely life no matter who is deemed right or who is deemed wrong by each viewer that theme of old age and loneliness evoking a sense of dread in most of us is inescapable,1
326,i was not really fond of the first cube movie it was a good idea but the annoying acting and characters always kept me from liking it too much did not really feel the need to see its sequel but when i heard they were making a third movie that would act as more of a prequel to the original i was intrigued thinking that maybe they would fix some of the originals problems and provide us with a memorable cast of characters well i thought wrongcube zero starts well enough by introducing us with the two characters in charge of watching and maintaining the neverending maze of traps that plagues the people in the cube the filmmakers succeed in providing a sense of mystery with the establishment of the two mens daily routine several questions are created from it concerning the reason why people are send there and also the true nature of the ones who run the entire operation all of which are left entirely to the viewer the acting was a bit weak but all in all the movies first half moved relatively wellwith the story moving on one of the two watchers begins to develop serious doubts about what he is doing and later decides to go and help a group of the people trapped here is where everything rapidly starts to dissolve into dull cheesesent by the people who run the cube program we are introduced to the character jax along with his two underlings play a major reason as to why this movie is failure to start of jax looks and talks more like a third rate villain taken directly from a james bond movie complete with the ever popular glass eye that alone ruins any atmosphere created by the first halfs relatively nice pace what is more is that it begins to feel more like a comedy rather than a serious movie with some incredibly corny lines perhaps the screenwriter got bored and did not care the acting itself degrades to a further low when the former watcher meets the group in the cube the entire interaction is painful to watch as is everything else following itagain failing to impress on anything but weak characters dialog and acting cube zero is a waste of time for those searching for a good horror movie,0
327,i missed the beginning of this film which might account for why i disliked it so much on the other hand i have studied the fall of the roman republic for years so i know the story then again that might also be the reason why i disliked this filmthe film has more historical inaccuracies than extras though it is so inaccurate that i do not think they made an attempt for it to be correct in which case it can be forgiven the odd thing is that they sometimes go to great lengths to be historically accurate that it ends up getting confusing like throwing in antonius marriage to octavia and then pushing it aside two scenes later why even bring it up if it serves no purpose for the plot and octavia is never even seen and like calling antonius by his actual name marcus antonius in some scenes and by his strange english name mark antony in other scenesthough historical inaccuracies aside the film could still have been an entertaining watch if it was not for the leading lady there is not an ounce of dignity in her she is hysterical dramatical and completely lacking control of herself instead of being a clever and composed queen cleopatra turns into a hysterical teenager with a bad case of pms ninetyfive of that comes from the poor acting but five is also from poor script writing far too many stupid dramatic scenes are written into the script sometimes you were not watching antonius and cleopatra you were watching immature versions of dawson and joey from dawsons creekif you want to watch something about this period watch anything but this,0

333,ugly shot poorly scripted and amateurishly paced sequel to joe dantes one thousand nine hundred and eightyone classic the howling is one of the two or three only good werewolffilms ever made and yet it got rewarded by a series of obnoxious and unendurable sequels like this one if it is any consolation stirba is a sequel in name only and there is absolutely no connection with the characters or events that were introduced in dantes film the plot here revolves on a bloodthirsty cult of transsylvanian werewolves  primarily female ones  led by stirba stirba is played by sybil danning who transforms from a curvy old lady into a blond superbabe with impressive bosom in the blink of an eye and becomes all hairy when sexually aroused her archenemy is played by a seemly fatigue christopher lee his character  stefan crosscoe  is an occult investigator who travels to stirbas kingdom accompanied by an american couple who lost their friend to the werewolf cult in case you are exclusively looking for filthy gore and gratuitous nuditythis is your film even the smallest killing is shown in great detail and we are even treated to exploding eyeballs and the vile image of a dwarf who gets pierced on a pointy fence however if you want a little substance or depth you will be sorely disappointed the dialogues are embarrassing and there is absolutely no tension to detect anywhere the scriptwriters constantly seem to confuse werewolves with vampires the transsylvanian setting garlic wooden stakes and dannings gorgeous balcony is shamelessly exploited as the films only gimmick during the endcredits a shot in which she rips off her top is reedited repeatedly according to my fellow reviewer dr gore no less than seventeen times which is pretty pathetic and pointless the music is okay and some of the scenery is rather beautiful i am talking about the fiercelooking statues during the opening credits and the dark dungeons of stirbas castle the directing by philippe mora is a giant mess and  as far as i am concerned  his only worthwhile film remains the beast within released three years earlier,0
334,it is difficult to evaluate this or any other comparable film of the early sound era in terms that one might use for ordinary film commentary at times there is almost a desperation as many film personalities of the silent era try their wings at sound surely fearing that they will be left by the wayside as did happen to some rintintin however was pertfectly natural in such a vaudeville of unrelated sequences some were sure to stand out john barrymores soliloquy from richard ii is a moment certainly worth preserving by and large only those with earlier stage training exuded confidence however this is over all reasonably entertaining and a must for film buffs especially interested in the silent to sound transition,1
335,i actually intended to see this movie in the theatre it was actually sold out i actually went to see solaris instead which actually was the worst movie to be released in two thousand and twovictor rosa john leguizamo a tough streetwise street pharmacist freaks out when he sees a kid get shot so he decides to go clean and invest all of his money with jack peter sarsgaard things seem to be going pretty well until jack skips town with his girlfriend trish denise richards this happened very late in the movie so had they not revealed this in the preview it might have been an interesting twist but they did so it is notin fact there is not a single interesting thing about this movie everything is given away in the preview if you saw even one preview you saw the whole movie so you might just want to think really hard to fill in the gaps go to the website download the preview save yourself threeninetynine there is not a single surprise or twist in the entire film other than how terrible the soundtrack isi hope that whoever was in charge of writing the soundtrack was fired twice most of it is what music would be like if the only songs allowed to be released were ricky martin and gloria estefan duets and i may shatter the fabric of the spacetime continuum with a concept as mindnumbing as this they both had less talent and musical abilitythe acting is at best poor the script is at best a crime against humanity and denise richards is at best sixtyseven styrofoam and thirtythree ziploc bag you know things are bad when john leguizamo he was in the pest upstages the rest of the cast with his acting abilities,0
336,the cobweb is an example of many examples of movies that feature strong sometimes noteworthy performances and high points but unfortunately are shattered and slowed down drastically by a murky plot and very little to interest the audience it stars richard widmark as a doctor working at a mental institution whose life becomes in turmoil due to family problems and a rather ludicrous and overworked conflict that really seems like no big deal at allthe plot is preposterous its time for the institution to get new drapes for the library windows one old woman wants to have her drapes put over them but a lot of the patients want to make their own and somehow this ridiculous and unintentionally loony conflict breaks out into the point where lives are in danger and families start to fall apart it sounds more like a conflict that would occur between very young childrenthe questioning of the logic of the plot and whether it could really happen is so massive that one wonders if only a reallike lunatic could buy it do not get me wrong there is nothing wrong with the acting the cast following widmark is composed of other great actors many of them academy awardnominees and winners and there is occasionally a moment in the film that works out brilliantly but it always excludes the stupid plot about window drapes unfortunately there is too much about the doggone drapes and thus the movie slows down a lot of the takes are long and done from one camera viewpoint adhering to the slow pacing and lack of viewing interestin a short analysis the cobweb is an unrecognized film and it becomes obvious why to the viewers basically as soon as the plot comes into focus which it does pretty quickly it just really does not sound like much fun to watch and i tell you that it is not much fun to watch,0
337,there was a genie played by shaq his name was kazaam and he was whack his rhymes were corny this lines were bad some stupid kid cryin over his stupid dad bad actin bad casting bad special effects what is next this movie sucks probably did not make twenty bucks he lives in a boombox not a lamp hurts like a cramp like a wet food stampyeah you get it a stupid rhyming genie who cannot act in a stupid movie with horrible special effects oh and its confusing as hell i am not even going to go on let us just say it belongs in the its so bad its funny category watch it once with your buddies and get a good laugh but do not expect anything spectacular,0
338,the dentist starts on the morning of dr alan feinstone corbin bernsen  his wife brookes linda hoffman wedding anniversary on the surface mr  mrs feinstone seem to have a nice life a beautiful home in los angeles  he has a successful career with responsibility but beneath things are very wrong alan discovers that brooke is having an affair with matt michael stadvec the swimming pool cleaner to add to his humiliation alan then discovers that matt is also having sex with paula roberts lise simms one of his next door neighbours  to top it all off he owes the irs who are breathing down his neck a she would load of money alan starts to lose his mind he convinces himself that everything is decayed  rotten just like his patients teeth  it is up to him to fix it that morning at work he begins to take his frustrations  anger out on his patients first he injures a young boy named jody brian mclaughlin he sexual assaults a patient named april reign christa sauls after he hallucinates that she is his wife  deliberately performs an unnecessary  painful procedure on another alan also begins to take drugs as he completely loses it  goes homicidal starting with his adulterous wife  pool cleanerdirected by brian yuzna i thought the dentist was a good film  tried something a bit different the script by dennis paoli stuart gordon  charles finch is more of a psycho thriller than straight slasher which came as a surprise to me as i was expecting the latter it would have been easy to make a teenage slasher film like friday the thirteenth one thousand nine hundred and eighty with a high body count  a wise cracking dentist villain but what the dentist actually turned out to be is very different the dentist is at heart a character study of one mans descent into madness  it does a fine job although having said that i am not sure what he goes through is enough justification for his subsequent murderous actions it moves along at a nice pace has a nice narrative in which i liked the constant connection alan makes between the decay he sees in his patients  the decay he sees in the world around him  is an entertaining way to pass ninety odd minutes it goes without saying that anyone with a phobia about the dentist probably should give this one a miss or you will never go again i liked the ending too where the tables are turned i will say no moredirector yuzna does his usual fine job here in fact i do not think i have seen a yuzna film that i did not enjoy to some extent he obviously  predictably takes the opportunity to play on our fear of the dentist with some nice dental torture set pieces including pulling peoples teeth out sexually molesting them performing operations on drugs  torturing people with the dreaded dentists drill there are some other gore scenes as well a dead dog someone gorily slashed with a knife  cut out tongues yuzna gives the film a certain style on what was probably a low budget he likes to tilt his camera which make for some nice angles  i liked the shot where the camera is above someone being knifed  huge sprays of blood splatter on the floor in a nice wide overhead angletechnically the dentist is fine decent cinematography music  production values although some of the special makeup effects look a little unconvincing the acting is pretty strong from everyone involved with corbin putting in a good crackpot performance the ever cool  genre favourite ken foree turns up as detective gibbs one of los angeles finestthe dentist did not turn out like i had expected  all the better for it if your a horror fan  perhaps want something a bit different then this is well worth checking out i liked it  think it is definitely worth a watch,1
339,how the grinch stole christmas instantly stole my heart and became my favorite movie almost from my very first viewing now eight viewings later it still has the same impact on me as it did the first time i saw itscreenwriters jeffery price  peter s seaman of who framed roger rabbit fame do a fantastic job of adapting the story of the grinch to the screen ron howards direction brought the story to full life and jim carreys typically energetic performance as the grinch steals the showsome detractors of the film have claimed that it is not true to the spirit or principles of the original story having read the original story i must say i cannot agree the movie makes the very same point about christmas and its true meaning as the original story indeed it enhances the impact of the story by making it more personal by showing us how and why the grinch became what he wasmild spoilers they probably would not ruin the movie for you but if you have not seen it yet and you are one of those who wants to know nothing about a story until you have seen it you should skip the next two paragraphsi think just about everyone can relate to the grinchs terrible experiences in school i think all of us at one time or another were the unpopular one in school who was always picked on i know i was and that is why i personally had so much sympathy for the grinch and what he went throughand cindy lou who is naive idealism believing that nobody can be all bad was heart rending when everyone else had turned their backs on the grinch out of fear and ignorance cindy lou was determined to be his friend if only everyone could have such an attitudein fact i think the only thing that might have made the film a little better would have been to further tone down the adult humor and content it was already pretty restrained but any of this adult humor like when the grinch slammed nose first into martha may whoviers cleavage just does not fit in a story like thisthis ones well on its way to being a christmas classic taking a richly deserved place alongside the book and the chuck jones cartoon as a mustsee of every christmas season,1
340,i would like to comment the series as a great effort the story line although requiring a few improvements was pretty well especially in season one season two however became more of a freak show and lost das original charm season one story line was more interesting a light side to the life at jam pony while a focused serious plot with manticore chasing down the xseries i was looking forward to new seasons in fact i still am i hope the fox guys and da production crew realize that a lot of people still wait for da to make a comeback even after two yrs of it being cancelled da can make it big if worked on properly and i think a name like james cameron should take on this challenge,1

343,how low can someone sink while trying to recapture an old glory sthf will be glad to show youif you are used to seeing what made for a good star trek show do not watch thisthe writing is hodgepodge the actors portrayals of their characters weak and most of all the design work is downright doggylike watching strong captains do not look here like the strong federation attitude forget about it here starfleet is mocked by ensigns wearing spikes in their hairwhile a seemingly mentally feeble captain shuffles about and within two minutes of the opening shows credits ensign spikey is attempting to arrange a tryst with an engineer it just degrades from there no not even uniforms match for goodness sake they are too small or too big collars down to their chests and tng seasons one and two uniforms mixed in with season three and dsnine uniforms the strict discipline and tradition of any of the originals in lacking in this production down to the treads the only good thing about this show is its graphics which seem to improve a bit with each season ok i take that back who uses cg that inexpertly the designers of this showdo not bother with it it will offend your star trek sense as it did mine not even the throw backs to previous shows can save this catastrophei wept openly when i watched this probably because my eyes were bleeding and my head almost ruptured that bad,0
344,if todd sheets were to come out and admit that this movie was intended to spoof the zombie genre i would change my rating to an eight try to imagine a movie where every scene line and even every acting nuance was designed to be a parody i could probably crap out alphabet soup rearrange what was left of the letters and still have a better script two scenes in particular come to mind when i think of this movie spoiler alert one is when mikes dad and the other dad walk i repeat walk down a staircase jam packed with zombies this is a small staircase and even though they brush up against the flailing undead nothing happens to them when they reach the end the exmarine turns around says god you are a horny bastard and shoots only one the other is in the military complex the girl stabs a zombie with a machete and is immediately surrounded the camera moves around her for roughly forty seconds while she is surrounded by zombies at an arms length away she then almost casually runs out from the crowd and joins the other humans spoiler alert over these scenes must be seen to be believed still i enjoy this movie as much as almost any comedy just because it is so damn funny kudos to todd sheets for getting so many people in his movie and having the drive to make it but not really for anything else,0

346,a disappointing filmthe story established our protagonist as chrissy a young rather sullen individual drifting not doing much actually she does very little to move the narrative along so it did not surprise me to see the focus shifting on her relatives it is a pity though chrissy seem like interesting characterstory was predictable and at times felt quite formulated so the question now is when are we going to see the campions jacksons and the tamahoris breaking ground with compelling cinematicallytold stories that will inspire rather than entertain for the toll of two hourstechnically a disgusting shot film,0

349,and even then even they can live without seeing it to be honest this film if one deigns to call it that is of real interest only to bondage freaks bettie page fans will learn absolutely nothing new and i do mean nothing nor will they enjoy the warm fuzzies of experiencing anything familiar loved or cherishednevermind the abysmal screenplay the wooden lessthancommunitytheater acting the utter absence of direction the crappy lighting or any of the rest of the bargain basement production values this is definitely hey kids let us make a movie moviemaking of the lowest order i suppose one could be thankful that at least they knew how to run the camera no i am sorry to say that none of that is germane to why this thing is so outright wrongit is wrong because the young lady playing bettie page a somewhat zaftig girl whose only resemblance to the queen of curves is dark hair and the trademark bangs utterly fails to bring anything to the role beyond a willingness to be bound and gagged this is apparently a good thing for her film career before and since this wretched excess but not for the wretched excess itself which consists primarily of a number of lovingly reenacted bd setpieces sandwiched between horrendously awful fauxbiographical scenes delineating ms pages fall from grace so to speak there is actually probably more information per se about pages life in the opening and closing credits than the rest of the moviedo not be fooled this is not a worthy companion film to the notorious bettie page this is not a worthy film at all this is a fetish piece that trades on the allure of one of the greatest pinups of all time and does it without class without style and without any real sense of understanding the character of bettie page whatsoever no true bettie page fan will find it to be anything but a disappointment i guarantee thatavoid at all costs if free remember that time is money too yours may not be worth much but i am betting it is worth enough that you will be sorry you wasted time with this one that is it i am done you have been warned,0

353,first let me say i am not from the south but i am an american i do not love country music but i can stomach it i would never wear a cowboy hat but i wear hats i do not live in a trailer but i do eat tuna salad and own a home what does that have to do with this comment a lot if you are one of those people who say only country people love this movie this movie is loosely based on the they loved and lost premise james bridges directs an american love story as real as it gets in an era of jerry springer and let us put it out there mentality this film rings truer than ever bud is coming of age and embarks on a life of his own with a little help from his aunt and uncle so he moves to the big city with them bud finds himself drawn into the local honky tonk world for the only escape a blue collar man can afford he quickly meets sissy who is from a similar background and the two have a whirlwind romance filled with painful ups and downs this plot takes so many turns that one has to just sit for a few minutes before they get hooked marriage is a focus here that is often missed early in the film they marry and we view the transition from being single to married the film highlights some of the modern struggles a woman has when she marries an old fashioned man it also brings into view the male ego with women and competitionbud is challenged and is excited when mickys puts in an electronic bull sissy gets ideas of having fun on it too but is quickly reminded that she is married and need to start acting like it the emotion between the two characters is raw and expressive and the plot continues from there especially when they note this is giving some of the storyline away split and sissy falls for an ex con with a penchant for abuse and cruelty she soon realizes that the grass is not always greener on the other sidehow anyone can compare bud to vinnie barbirino is shocking to me john travolta gave an exceptional performance that was worthy recognition he was believable and real the scene where he shaves his beard and you first see him at the barstill gives me goosebumps mind you i am not a huge travolta fan but come on i see why sissy was kicking of her boots so early in the film deb winger was so real that you found yourself sympathizing with her as she pens a note of emotions to bud after sneaking in to clean his house during their break up the supporting cast was incredible wes played by scott glenn gave a first rate performance that made you hate him and curse him as he abused sissy madolyn smithosborne as buds mistressgirlfriend was so authentic that large chested girls across the yous prayed to wake up flat chested to wear the clothes she donned in the film my biggest kudoss go to barry corbin and brooke anderson as buds aunt and uncle they seemed like someone is aunt and uncle somewhere in texas and however small their role they made the film so much bigger and lifelike two memorable scenes were the dolly parton contest and the unforgettable scene where bud and his aunt stand outside after one of the characters death the dialog between them is touchingif you can watch this for what it is a true american love story then i recommend that you take it for what it isa film before it is time that gave us voyeurism into a world unlike our own but real enough for our enjoyment and entertainment if this world sounds similar to yours then you will enjoy it so much more lastly the music however dated is sure to send you back in time if you are over thirty years of age,1
354,satans little helper is one of the better b horror movies i have seen when i say better i mean the story the film hatches a new plot something that is not so cliché in the horror genre  something fresh but there are also some ridiculous questions that come along with it questions you will be asking yourself throughout the moviethe film first caught my attention while i was cruising the horror section in hmv i was tired of all the so called terrifiying hollywood blockbusters and wanted something different the cover art for satans little helper immediately caught my attention as you can see the image draws you in  it is chilling i knew it was a straight to dvd release  but i took a chance i mean i just seen boogey man the night before  so it could not get any worse after i watched the movie i was semisatisfied i loved the plot of the movie it was really creepy how the killer was pretending to be the little boys friend so he could kill in some sick deranged way he actually thought he and the little boy would become partners  a duo of terror it was a great idea to set the film on halloween night this way no one would think anything of a masked man beside a little kid they would simply think he was his guardian but this is also where the plot holes begin to surfaceif your son came home with a friend he met trick or treating  that is fine you would not think anything of it  if he was nine or round about the same age as him if however he appeared with a strange man in a mask you would be startled and protective of your child you would ask the man to remove his mask and identify himself you would ask why he is with your son he does not know him you would tell him to please leave he is not a family friend he is a stranger now we are supposed to teach our child not to talk to strangers in this case the mum is completely fine with it huh they never seem to think it is a tad odd that the man does not speak  at all gruanted they think it is the daughters boyfriend but after ten minutes of not talking you would pull the mask off and ask him why he is not saying a wordthe film goes down hill from there the thing that got me the most was all the mum said was do you want some cider i cannot count how many times she says this in the movie it is like oh you are dying  we have cider though it is all good the movie started promising and failed to deliver it was more of a horrorcomedy and even as that it fails to deliver i guess you could call it a dudflop etcthe best thing about the movie is the cover art though something tells me that is not worth the twelve dollars,0

356,xizao is a rare little movie it is simple and undemanding and at the same time so rewarding in emotion and joy the story is simple and the theme of old and new clashing is wonderfully introduced in the first scenes this theme is the essence of the movie but it would have fallen flat if it was not for the magnificent characters and the actors portraying themthe aging patriarch master liu is a relic of chinas preexpansion days he runs a bath house in an old neighbourhood every single scene set in the bath house is a source of jelaousy for us stressed out unhappy people not even hardened cynics can find any flaws in this wonderful settingmaster lius mentally handicapped son er ming is the second truly powerful character in the movie coupled with his modernlife brother the interactions between these three people and the various visitors to the bath house are amazingly detailed and heartfelt with some scenes packing so much emotion it is beyond almost everything seen in movieswith its regimecritical message this movie was not only censored but also given unreasonably small coverage it could be a coincidence but when a movie of this caliber is virtually impossible to find even on the internet you cannot help getting suspiciousso help free speech and the movie world buy rent copy this wonderful movie and if you happen to own the dvd if there even is one then share share share,1
357,this is the crappiest film i have ever seen but in all fairness it is watchable and rather funny i do not think the filmmakers intended it to be your typical hollywood blockbuster quality it is just a stupid film about a serial killer who gets doused in a load of toxic waste causing a reaction with him and the snow as it is the middle of winter he then turns into a killer snowman which is enough to to make you laugh on it is own this film is really stupid but it is funny the killings are hilariousi would not advise you to go and buy it like i did the cover looked goodbut if it happens to be on tv one night and you are up for a laugh then stick it on,0

359,first i want to clarify that the average users inability to appreciate imagination is appalling what makes this show so unique is the hyperreality it creates you do not need to know why ned can bring people back from the dead or why it can only be for a minute where has the wonderment of childhood whimsical tales gone much like a wrinkle in timei say it is refreshingly original because it is a polar opposite to the masses of layitallout television that leaves no room for imagination or wonderit is nice to add a bit of escapism to the television experiencethe hyperreality is my favorite aspect of the show the one thousand nine hundred and fiftysesque setting the innocent and rare characters and the scenery and physical setting which are not meant to be taken as pure realitythis show masks the morbid nature of death while others embrace it while entertaining other television shows have taken a back shelf to this series it truly has restored a sense of curiosity imagination and wonder to televisionpushing daisies quickly made it to the top of my list,1
360,i saw this movie years ago and i was impressed but then again i was only twelve years old i recently rewatched it and want that time back this film is pretty bad while i like lee majors chris makepeace watch my bodyguard one thousand nine hundred and eightyif you would like to see a good movie that he was in of meatballs also starring bill murray for some laughs and burgess meredith this role doesdid nothing for their careersanyway lee majors character franklyn hart is an ex race car driver who plans on driving his race car which he had in storage across the country to california one problem the government has outlawed all private transportation i thought the concept was ok not the worse i have heard of but the execution failed horribly,0
361,this movie is a great example of how even some very funny jokes can go terribly wrong i really expected at least something from this movie after seeing the add which was funny as hell but the movie was not half as goodthe weird part is that the jokes are actually funny the spoofs of the smoking ban jo bole etc are genuinely good jokes but i do not know whom to blame this movie flop onthe prime candidates may be one the hammers  actors and hammeresses actresses and not even the funny kind two the director threethe guy who cast the actors andor the director anyway if you are really really bored and i mean really see this movie or else get a copy of each and every ad or teaser of this movie and laugh your butt of because those will be far funnier than the filmps the only saving grace of this film is mahesh manjrekar and the funny chappu bhai,0
362,a truly unpleasant film while rick bakers special effects are quite impressive if stomachturning it has no other redeeming features like many seventys movies it leaves you feeling as if you need to take a long shower and scrub the slime off of yourself the characters are uniformly unpleasant and plot makes no sense,0
363,spoilers like some evil tinkerstoeverstochance doubleplay combination we have in omen iv the evil seed of the deceased antichrist damien thorn come back terrorizing his parents his schoolmates his neighbors and finally the entire world as a she named delia york asia vieila after being given to a deserving couple the yorks karen  gene fay grant  michael woodsby the catholic churchs st francis orphanagelittle delia did not waste any time making her peasants felt by scratching her mom at a house party later delia almost get killed by a runaway truck only to have herself saved by this devil dog named ryder going to school delia takes care of the local bully by getting the big guy to wet himself in front of all his classmates later when his father threatens the yorks with a law suit she has his head sliced off in a selfinduced traffic accident delia is someone that you never mess with if you know what is good for youmeanwhile dalias dad gene becomes a big man in town on his own or so he thinks by getting elected to the congress as a champion of the clean air and green trees crowd instead of letting the smog and concrete boys take over the neighborhood with his eye now on he white house itself did his bratty and strange daughter delia have anything to do with gene yorks sudden good fortuneit is only later when jo ann hearen is hired as delias nanny that the truths comes out about her strange and evil powers jo a new age type realizes that delia is a bit weird after turning all her white crystals black and calls her new age guru noah jim byrnes to come over and check her out noah is so upset by what he sees in delia kirilian color vibrations all black and blue with a little pinch of red that it flips him out so bad that he almost crashed into delias moms cartaken on a trip to a psychic festival by jo delia turns the entire event into an inferno setting the place through mental telepathy on fire and heaving everyone there run for cover including poor noah who was at the festival and ended up with his leg broken the and shaken and battered guru was so shook up by the whole experience that he later checked out of the country to become a hermit in the tibetan wilderness jo herself is later thrown out with the help of the sweet and cuddly family pet ryder of a second floor window to her death because she knew and talked too much it is when karen is again pregnant that she decides finally to find out the truth about the real parents of delia that is when sheand we in the audience come face to face with the truth she is not only the feared antichrist of revelations she is his twin sister her brother the antichrist himself is about to come on the scene as her kid brother the sill unborn alexander yorkthree times were more then enough for the antichrist coming back to earth to bring about armageddon the movie going public were already getting a little tired of of him and his evil adventures with a fourth really not necessary since daimen thorn the original antichrist had been dead and buried for years were put through the usual ringer with no one believing that little delia is thee antichrist until it was almost too late to stop her in her deadly rounds of destroying the entire human race the movie as bad as it is is also far too long ninetyseven minutes for a horror flick that could well have told it is story is as little as eighty minuteshaving a private eye earl knight mchael learnerand later a former catholic nun sister yvonnemegan lehchand now faith healer felichy in the film only to be killed off did not help the plot either it only prolonged the suffering of those of us watching the movie you could see the surprise ending coming almost as soon as the film omen iv began with the bases being cleared for delias eventual takeover of the civilized as well as uncivilized world what was a bit of a surprise was delia doing it with a little help from friends,0
364,there was not one original idea in this story themes were pulled from various sources a few being the ninth gate in the mouth of madness another carpenter film and the ring it even went as far as featuring the same damn glowing circle from the ring and using it as the films namesake the soundtrack by cody carpenter was all but lifted from suspiria hopefully no one will oppose this comment by spewing the word homage around yes i saw that the theater was playing argentos deep red claiming an homage would be a bullshit copout this was bottomofthebarrel throwing gore and disturbing imagery into the pot does not make a good horror film carpenter used to know that he should fade into obscurity or acquire a time machine,0
365,i caught this at a screening at the sundance film festival and was in awe over the absolute power this film has it is an examination of the psychological effects on our brave soldiers who join the military with hopes that they will protect and serve our country with honor as well as be taken care of by our government for it the film details the psychological changes that takes place in boot camp as the soldiers are turned into killers for their country and put into the war and the after effects once they return home it also portrays the effect that killing has on the human psyche it pays homage to the soldiers and never ever criticizes the soldiers unlike other films instead criticizes a system that is not prepared to and does not take care of all the physical and psychological needs of the returned vetsthis film is powerful moving emotional and thought provoking it stands as a call to arms to support our troops not only by buying stickers and going to parades but by actually listening to them and helping to support a change in the way their health and well being is taken care of after the killing endsthe best film of the festival so far ,1
366,there was a stylish approach to this film on the part of director vincenzo natali with interesting camera angles and effective closeups it was also refreshing to see jeremy northam and lucy liu given leading roles and expanding their range as performers this film also included one of the most imaginative escape scenes in recent years the efforts of the director and the actors combined in an effective thrilleralthough the plotting of the film was convoluted the story progressed very clearly as the layers of corporate greed and skullduggery were revealedin one thousand nine hundred and fortynine george orwell suggested in his famous novel one thousand nine hundred and eightyfour that the future would be ruled by the totalitarian state which would control minds and diminish human liberty it was interesting that in this intriguing futuristic film it was not the state but rather the corporate world that controlled and devalued the human worker,1
367,i really think i should make my case and have everyhorror and or cultmoviebuff go and see this moviei diditisexcellent very atmospheric and unsettling and scaryincridible how they could make such a gem of a film with the very lowreadnobudget they hadsynopsis taken from website one morning an old man wanders out into the woods in search of his runaway cat he finds instead a child without parents and a murder with no corpseon this websiteimdb there is no trailer but i will leave a link here to the site of the movie itself where there is a trailer which is quite unsettling so please go and check it out,1
368,i actually did not mind the geico commercials the first fifty of so times i saw them and even found them to be a bit wry and amusing but seriously this is the best thing that these people could come up with this show sucks it is bland and feels like watching an episode of the office with the characters disguised as cavemen i know a lot of you will hate me for saying that but the office just does not do it for me okay i get it we have the poor slob just trying to keep his nose clean and he has a crappy boss who hates him the pseudointellectual who really just has a barelyfunctioning intellect and the dopey one who just wants to be accepted but so what i have worked with these people and found them just as annoying in real life as i do on tvwhy would i want to waste another onethree hundred and thirtysixth of my week watching more of those type nominates please call your parents and ask them if they dropped you on your head if after thinking about it you still delude yourself into believing that this is entertainment,0
369,i noticed at once that this movie really was not based on dodie smiths novel in any case it was a nice idea that pongo and perditas son now had his own puppies the cutest of the dalmatians was of course little snowball who was completely spotless till the very end of the film to be honest i did not know what to think when cruella de vil seemed to have changed completely kind in fact i have often thought about the possibility that she could become friendly but now that she so quickly changed into herself again and announced that she was cruella once more i almost began to be really worried about chloes dalmatiansactually the scene in which the puppies watched lady and the tramp while chloe and kevin had their dinner was much better than i had expected i also was fond of the parrot who played to be a dog and it was incredible that the dogs had learned so many tricks for this movie of course i was content that at the end the dalmatians were saved again but i would have liked to know what was going to happen to cruella after she had lost her whole property and what on earth could the dogs home do with such a huge sum of moneyfinally it was quite touching that snowball also had spots at the very end of the film,1
370,yes i will say before i start commenting this movie is incredibly underratedsharon stone is great in her role of catherine trammell as is morrissey as dr glass he is an analyst sent in to evaluate her after the death of a sports star glass is drawn into a seductive game that trammel uses to manipulate his mindthe acting was good apart from thewlisstone really has a talent with this role she is slick naughty and seductive and does not look a day older than she did in the firstshe really impressed melike in casino morrisey was also good he showed much vunerablitity in a role that needed it thewlis however was lame he ruined his character and was overthetop the whole way he really suckedoverall this movie not as good the first but stone is a hoot to watch just ignore thewlis,1
371,first of all the big named actors must need the money the surgical scenes were laughable and surely they must know that people who have a little knowledge of medicine would find this utterly absurdanesthesiologists do not leave the room during a heart transplantnor do they do the surgery in a tiny room devoid of instruments heart lung equipment and sterile techniques just a joke could not concentrate on the story line because of all the stupid surgery scenes no blood no personnel and then the hero doc coming in and taking over it is not a film for thinking adultsalso the budget must have been limited the street scenes were ok but who was the technical adviserseems like it was directed by a total idiot save your money and wait until it comes out on dvd and do not rent it,0
372,halloween is the story of a boy who was misunderstood as a child he takes out his problems on his older sister whom he murders at the beginning of the film this is just the start of things to come from michael myersdonald pleasance plays the doctor who is been studying myers for years he knows that something is different about him something mysteriously evil this evil will not be contained and it cannot be stoppedafter an escape from an institution myers tracks down his younger sister if he kills her there may be an end to the troubles of this misunderstood boy but he seems to have problems in finishing his sister off as other people get in the way he manages to take them out while still looking for that one girl he needsthere have been a lot of those horror movies involving teenagers getting hacked to pieces by a masked or gruesome killer but this one started it all sort of if you think about it most of those horror movies we all remember are the ones that have freddy kruger or jason chasing around half naked girls well if it was not for halloween those characters would not have haunted our dreams when we were childrenhalloweens director john carpenter got a lot out of the horror movies of the fiftys and combined everything he knew into one film that scared the hell out of a lot of people back in the late seventys this films solidified him as a director to watch and also jump started the career of jamie lee curtis who plays the girl being stalked by the masked killerthis film may seem cliché today but back then there was not much out there like this it is been copied from and ripped off of but halloween will always remain the quintessential teenage horror movie it still gives you chills listening to carpenters thrilling music while we see another victim get chased by that shadowy michael myers,1
373,for anyone who has seen and fallen in love with the stage musical a chorus line the movie is a shoddy substitute not only are songs cut but unnecessary plot twists added new dance sequences choreographed and let us face it richard attenborough just does not know how to film dancersonstage michael bennetts a chorus line was just that michael bennett his idea his choreography his direction his gift to broadway and the rest of the world it was two hours of hardhitting inyourface realism that really made you feel for these boys and girls the movie however lacks empathy and depth the actors look like they are auditioning for a chorus line rather than actually auditioning every move every line of dialogue seems so weighted and planned michael douglas especially as zach is too in control for us to believe that he is this extraordinarily bitchy choreographer even when he throws his temper tantrums you never quite believe him because every gesture every accented word every nuance is so obviously rehearsed and as for him not dancing kevin kline auditioned for the role of zach on broadway michael bennett loved his reading but kline could not dance and ultimately lost the part how i wish they had done the same for douglas a chorus line is supposed to be a show about nobodies and aside from a few recognizable faces vicki frederick who played cassie on broadway as sheila and khandi alexander of tvs newsradio as one of the many auditioning dancers you are not supposed to know any of these people because you do know these people having a star in any of the roles is a terrible decision when you focus on michael douglas and his ranting instead of on the girls and boys on the line and their stories you lose somethingit is truly unfortunate that the best sequence in the show montage hello twelve hello thirteen hello love is cut drastically to make way for a terrible new song entitled surprise surprise that surprisingly received a nomination at the oscars cassies mirror dance has a new song and tragically boring choreography  one wonders why they bothered to shoot a movie version at all if they were going to mess with a working formula this muchfor fans of musical theatre and those who enjoyed the stage version this movie is a sad mockery of everything they cherished and loved for those who never got to see the original production either on broadway or on tour this movie is the only reference they will have to go by and they will have to wonder just how it got to be the longestrunning musical in broadway history  until a little show called cats overtook it in the late one thousand nine hundred and ninetys but that is a different story and do not even get me started there,0
374,i own this movie not by choice i do i was really bored the other day and the box intrigued me so i popped it in the old vcr and spent the next hour and a half of my life crying why god why the storyline was not that bad as an gamer i could appreciate bits of it i think that maybe if you are into super geekycheese romantic scenes you will enjoy this film i always thought of myself as a vulcan you know like drspockunable to love there is very few good things to say about this film truly it is awful but if you are up to really badly made film this is the one for you the real storys much more interesting though if i had to sum up this film in one word it would belame,0
375,i fell in love with this silent action drama kurt russell and only kurt russell could have played this so well raised from childhood to know nothing but war and fighting todd kurt russell is dumped on a planet after being made obsolete by genetically engineered soldiersthe stage is set and another classic icon of action movies was born  soldier not rambo not schwarzenegger not bruce willis not mel gibson not jason statham  kurt russell owns this role and made it entirely his  original daring and all too human i miss the fact that sequels were never madetentenldmy faith ,1
376,i watched this film not really expecting much i got it in a pack of five films all of which were pretty terrible in their own way for under a fiver so what could i expect and you know what i was right they were all terrible this movie has a few and a few is stretching it interesting points the occasional camcorder view is a nice touch the drummer is very like a drummer ie damned annoying and well that is about it actually the problem is that its just so boring in what i can only assume was an attempt to build tension a whole lot of nothing happens and when it does its utterly tedious i had my thumb on the fast forward button ready to press for most of the movie but gave it a go and seriously is the lead singer of the band that great looking coz they do not half mention how beautiful he is a hell of a lot i thought he looked a bit like a meercat all this and i have not even mentioned the killer i am not even going to go into it its just not worth explaining anyway as far as i am concerned star and london are just about the only reason to watch this and with the exception of london who was actually quite funny it was not because of their acting talent i have certainly seen a lot worse but i have also seen a lot better best avoid unless your bored of watching paint dry,0
377,i sought out this film for one reasonal adamson he is among the worst directors of all timeright up there with ed wood jr and ray dennis steckler and the pantheon of awfulness however i was a tad disappointed because although the film was indeed bad it never approached the levels of awfulness of some of his earlier schlocky movies because of that this film was not particularly fun to watch for us bad movie fansnow i was wary about watching this film as the title naughty stewardesses makes the film sound like a pornographic filmsomething i would not be reviewing on imdb however this film appeared to be this at timesparticularly the first ten minutes but you could tell that the script underwent many changes as for much of the film there is not any titillation at all and towards the end of the movie there is a plot that comes out of no where that is violent and certainly not sexy the result of all this is total confusionsadly none of the many parts are even good for example as a porn video it shows surprisingly little and it is incomprehensible why they would put a seventyone yearold guy in some of the love scenes sure for a seventyone yearold mr livingston looked pretty goodbut he was still an old man and no one would want to see him getting it on with young nymphet then when the final twenty minutes becomes very violent as livingston became a rambolike guy talk about weird and inappropriateoverall there is little to recommend this sad movie it is not bad enough or sexy enough to care about and the film manages to be rather boring even with such a crazy title like naughty stewardesses,0
378,this independent film was one of the best films at the tall grass film festival that i have ever seen there i loved it there are so many things that was great about the film on top of all that the cast and crew that i had the opportunity to meet were absolutely phenomenali thought that avi did a great job in his role and ricky ullman was absolutely true to his role for a disney actor i was amazed at his talent to be able to go from cheesy teen comedy to such an adult role with no problems the talent in the film was just amazing the cinematography was just great if you want to see an independent film this is one really that you should seei think that mr gruver would have been so proud to have such a submission in his festival and his parents loved the movie so much when it won the audience favorite they went and saw it again this truly was a great film it was dark and funny and sad and truly emotional it was just fabulous i am honestly just so enthused by this film and i really do not want to spoil it for any one just see it and truly be amazed at it i think that these film makers really have what it takes to go places and i hope to see more work from them in the future,1
379,enormous fun for both adults and children this film works on numerous levels there is everything from car crashes and cake in the face to some very good yet subtle jokes for adultsglenn close is at her sublimely evil best as cruella call me ella de villeafter three years in dr pavlovs behaviour modification clinic she is cured of her desire for fur  even the puppyskin fur she had so intensely desired she even has all of her fur coats placed in the dungeon of the extraordinary castle she inhabitsbut it would not be a dalmatian movie without the subterfuge and machinations of cruella and you know that something will change her behaviour modification and now she needs one extra puppy hence one hundred and two dalmatians to complete her nefarious scheme this time roundioan gruffudd is instantly appealing as the hero of the film that runs the second chance dog shelter though he was in titanic and in last years television version as pip of great expectations i did not recognize him well he was fifth officer lowe in titanic and i did not see great expectations so i am not terribly surprisedgerard depardieu does a delightful turn as the furrierpawn of cruella he prances and postures in the most outlandish and outrageous of fur clothing you have ever seen  and does it well his wicked witch of the west homage is hilarioustim mcinnerny is superb is cruellas notsoevil henchman  he was also alonzo cruellas butler in one hundred and one dalmatians and you may also recognize him from all of the black adder britcoms he plays his usual bumbling goodhearted somewhat dimwitted character to great effectoscars for costuming are generally given for the entirety of the costuming in a film this is unfortunate as the clothing worn by glenn close is amazing  it is incredibly detailed note her handcuffs when she is being released from the behaviour modification clinic and worthy of such an overthetop character her clothing alone deserves at least an oscar nominationanimation holds a special place in my heart  but comparing this film to the original animated film is like comparing apples to orangutans it cannot be done suffice it to say that one hundred and two dalmatians is even better than the film version of one hundred and one dalmatians that came out in one thousand nine hundred and ninetysix there is a lot to like here from the sight gags the dialogue and the costumes to the casting  it is a good film for the whole family,1
380,in a time when hollywood is making money by showing our weaknesses despair crime drugs and war along comes this film which reminds us the concept of the indomitable spirit if you are feeling beaten down this movie will free your mind and set you soaring we all know how tough life can be sometime we need to be reminded that persistence and courage will get us through that is what this film did for me and i hope it will for you,1
381,i still have grainy late night nocable cheap vhs dubs of this show from waaaaaayyyy back when latenightcommercials and all when i would stay up to whatever weird hour they would slap this show on  just so i could tape itthe series was not really about freddy kreuger  only the first couple of episodes actually involved him as anything but a rod serlingesquire announcer instead each episode was a distinct nightmare using the traditional horror themes of horrific childhood dating cannibalism dating money death dating and hmm datingfrom the episode where a teenage boy accidentally says i will love you forever to the wrong girl and is stuck with her literally at least for a moment they grow together to the one where a young stewardess goes home with a strange man only to find herself in his cabin where he has a trophy room full of other stewardesses and one i only vaguely remember which compared blind dates to hockey and the injuries and penalties that go with it  dating was definitely the scariest thing in the seriesone episode had jeffrey combs reanimator etc as a motivated pizza merchant with a tasty new secret ingredient not original but still creepy and funeven so some of the episodes were great my personal favorite was it is a miserable life where a young man is trapped working in his parents burger joint when he wants to go off to college stuck talking to himself and doing little puppet shows with old cheeseburgers  until one late night when a weird guy comes through the drive through and suddenly his life is not the same no not freddy just a thug with a gun  turns out the whole mindblowing episode is just that  the last thoughts that pass through the kids head along with a bulletthe second half of the same episode many of the freddies nightmares episodes were essentially two vaguely connected short stories followed his girlfriend who was also wounded but not killed in the driveby and who is taken to the hospital from heck  they cram in all the most creepy hospital nightmare clichés and then some  from accidentally having your mouth sewn shut  or waking up during an operation  to having your dead boyfriend try and lure you into the morgue for a little cuddleagain that was my favoritesome of the episodes were much dumber like almost all of the ones they have made available on video they put the crummy ones out as representative of the series and then nobody likes them thinks the show stunk and then they do not put any more on video it is a miserable life is only available on pal dvd in england  but i am still going to buy it,1
382,deliriously romantic comedy with intertwining subplots that mesh beautifully and actors who bounce lines off each other with precise comic timing a feat that is beautiful to behold when chers spineless fiancé asks her to help him make peace with his estranged moody younger brother no one could dream the consequences which follow operatic symbolism catholic church confessions love bites and falling snowmoonstruck is timeless and smooth it takes about fifteen minutes for the pictures rhythm to kick in there is an early sequence with the grandfather and his dogs at the cemetery that is a little rough and a following scene with cosmo and the elderly man at the gate that seems obtuse but the patchwork of the plot is interwoven with nimble skill and the movies wobbly tone and kooky spirit are both infectious onetwo from ,1

384,just a note to add to the above comment fear of a black hat does not have the criminal who is image has been ripped off by the band that is in cbfour easily confused as the two films are so similar but black hat is vastly the superior of the two yeah,1
385,how can you take her hardliving glamorously violent bounty hunter story serious with that accent it is absurd apart from that the visual style of the directer is nauseating and gimmicky the plot is a shallow boring confused gangstermovie rehash and the acting is unconvincing the film introduces new characters all the way throughout the film and is told in fragmented flashback  mostly out of sequence  seemingly just to keep you nice and confused the film ever shows you things that do not really happen and then later says that did not really happen this happened  see the apparent killing of the fake first ladies what have we seen the first wrong sequence of events for thenterrible choice in casting a convoluted messy plot and a headacheinducing directorial style onefive,0
386,first saw this half a lifetime ago on a blackandwhite tv in a small samoan village and thought it was hilarious now having seen it for the second time so much later i do not find it hilarious i do not find anything hilarious anymore but this is a witty and lighthearted comedy that moves along quickly without stumbling and i thoroughly enjoyed itit is one thousand nine hundred and fortyfive and fred macmurray is a fourf who is dying to get into one of the armed forces he rubs a lamp in the scrapyard he is managing and a genie appears to grant him a few wishes ho hum right but though the introduction is no more than okay the fantasies are pretty lively macmurray tells the genie that he wants to be in the army poof and he is marching along with washingtons soldiers into a particularly warm and inviting uso where june haver and joan leslie are wearing lots of lace doilies or whatever they are and lavender wigs washington sends macmurray to spy on the enemy  redcoating germanspeaking hessians not brits the hessians are jammed into a bierstube and singing a very amusing drinking song extolling the virtues of the vaterland where the white wine is winier and the rhine waters rhinier and the bratwurst is mellower and the yellow hair is yellower and the frauleins are jucier and the goose steps are goosier something like that the characterizations are fabulous as good as sig rumanns best otto preminger is the suspicious and sinister hessian general you know heidelberg vee are two hundred and fortyone to one against you  but vee are not afraid i cannot go on too long with these fantasies but they are all quite funny and so are the lyrics when he wishes he were in the navy macmurray winds up with columbus and the fantasy is presented as grand opera do not you know that sailing west meant a terrifically expensive investment and who do you suppose provides the means but isabella queen of queens when they sight the new world someone remarks that it looks great i do not care what it looks like mutters columbus but that place is going to be called columbuslandanyway everything is finally straightened out though the genie by this time is quite drunk and macmurray winds up in the marine corps with the right girli have made it sound too cute maybe but it is cute the kids will enjoy the puffs of smoke and the magic and the corny love story the adults will get a kick out of the more challenging elements of the story who are the hessians unless they happen to be college graduates in which case they might want to stick with the legerdemain and say wow awesome,1
387,this movie is great if you enjoy watching bclass movies that is this is a classic college eightys slasher movie in which one song is played throughout the entire soundtrack a horrible film but worth renting to make fun of or just to watch old men pop out of closets with knives kind of funny if you ask me,1
388,this movie is inspiring to anyone who is or has been in a tough jam whether financially or emotionally you will definitely laugh which is the best medicine  left in a bad financial situation when her husband dies grace has to find a new way to make some money and it is not exactly legal which adds to the humour even my boyfriend liked it so do not think that it is a chickflic,1
389,two houses one street one phone booth one car a girl next door a boy next door and a zombie this list of ingredients should suffice for a great horror movie all you need is some blue light ambient music anddone not in the hands of dutch director van rouveroy though i like to organize bad movie evenings from time to time the concept is really simple get some booze get some filmloving friends and immerse yourself in the worst cinema can offer for such an evening this peace of filth is one of the best laughs guaranteedthe bizarre thing is van rouveroy is still defending her film as if it were a great achievement to be a witness to this you will have to listen to the dvds commentary track again disbelieve and laughs guaranteed,0
390,i usually steer clear of tv movies because of the many ways you know that it is tv movies five seconds into the picture this one got my attention because of the unusual title and its gloomy wellcrafted mood that is established from the very start while the ever present rain confirmed my suspicions of a misplaced story even if claiming to be set in california the movie was largely shot around a stormy vancouver bc the dark and oppressive outdoors beautifully complement olmos excellent acting,1
391,caution may contain spoilersi have seen this movie three times  i have liked it every time upon seeing it again i am always reminded of how good it is an hbo tv movie very well done like most of their movies are this would have gotten oscars for it is performances had it been released for general distribution instead of made for tvas i am sure anyone knows from reading other reviews here this is the story of serial murderer andrei chikatilo he murdered fiftysix people over eight years in the former soviet union three victims were buried  could not be found so he was only convicted of fiftytwo out of fiftythree of his murders the story actually focuses more on the forensic analyst victor burakov played to perfection by stephen rea a man that becomes tortured and obsessed with finding this killer despite the additional obstacles placed by party hacks his part is essential to be sure there is a very touching scene towards the end of the movie that mentions how in america investigators are routinely taken off serial killer cases after eighteen months whether they want to or not due to the mental strain  frustration according to this account burakov worked for over five years before getting his first break from it he followed the case to its conclusion three years later in this scene his superior general fetisov played by donald sutherland actually tells him he admires his dedication and apologizes for not knowing he should have given him a break soonerreas performance is so well done he does not overact chew up the scenery or do anything that distracts from his portrayal of a man who is hell bent on finding his killer he is a man with passion but does not show it in the same manner as is so usually portrayed in detective movies he only occasionally gives outbursts after quietly putting up with more than most could stand under such circumstances rea does so much with his face his eyes he does not need to overact he just is  his character so frustrated after so long at one point driven to frustration he actually says he would rather find three at one time than none in a year of course what he means is not that he wants more people to die he just wants some clues to catch this man rea makes us feel for this man he makes us understand but a glimpse of what it is to live with such horror and futilitya mutant to be sure chikatilos childhood was one which produces such monsters the character of chikatilo is very well done by jeffrey demunn he somehow impossible though it may seem elicits some modicum of sympathy for himself perhaps he is the worst of us gone terribly wrong either way his performance is very well donedonald sutherland as colonel fetisov later promoted to general also does a great job he starts out seeming to be a cynical worldly official that does not seem much more interested in helping the investigation than anyone else blocking burakov but he eventually becomes more than just an assistant he actually actively participates in helping burakov there is also a very nice turn by max von sydow as the psychiatrist brought in to help profile and figure out what kind of deviant they are looking foralthough this movie deals with a morbid grotesque and violent story it really is more about what it takes to catch a killer than the killer himself all around a very well done movie with fine performances and a great screenplay the screenplay manages to do what the best of this type of movie does give factual events  place them meaningfully inside a dramatic framework that makes you feel like you know the people behind the factsnine out of ten stars,1
392,with one of my very favorite actors james spader i expected this film to be at least tolerable it was not after the first half hour i watched the rest of it with the remote control in my hand so the fast forward was at the ready so trite so standard one knows what is going to happen in each scene one can even predict the dialogue word for word this is one of those movies that makes one scratch ones head and say how did this movie ever get made in an effort to say something positive i will add that there are some mildly entertaining special effects but on the whole if you have seen five scifi movies or you are over nine years old do yourself a favor and skip this one,0
393,alan alda plays reallife sports illustrated writer george plimpton who was once invited to join the detroit lions football team as an honorary member rather wan uncompelling drama curiously tempered with fantasy director alex march takes an interesting tack on this material shooting it in a quasidocumentary fashion with macho commentary and yet giving the tale a touch of capraesque whimsy still by bringing out the cinematic flashiness in this setup he turns the main narrative into a jumble aldas smug uncharismatic performance is another handicap though the supporting cast is filled with reallife proathletes and scintillating lauren hutton as aldas girlfriendhow is that for a fantasy onetwo from ,0
394,short synopsis this film opens with soldiers being released from the company of men one of them pursues another with a weird scheme the other repeatedly refuses later they both get trapped in an office building in which they want to crack a safe during the christmas holidays hostility turns into playful banter and then into a desperate fight for survival during the bantering they lose all drinkable liquids so it is really serious with exposed well built and well oiled torsos they ram a hole into a wall and finally manage to escape  only to find out that they have been betrayed and set up by women one gets caught the other remains free and is not given away by his companion a last encounter a last light for a cigarette adieu lami farewell friendi found it hard not to see closet homosexuals in the two main characters played by classical heman superstars alain delon and charles bronson they are obviously attracted to each other their treatment of women is abominable and marked by contempt throughout the whole story seems to have a strong symbolic undertow a little like deliverance it is also very stylish the safe the two men want to crack is in a  for the time  ultra modern glass and aluminum tower it is the seat of a publicity firm so there are many fancy posters and wall coverings around the wardrobe is also very good the ultra stylish citroen ds maybe the most modern and elegant car of all times features large in this movie  perhaps a subtle kind of product placementi can recommend this movie for the actors performances alone delon and bronson are really sharing the top billing in a manner that struck me as very fair and sporting both do a considerable amount of acrobatics i have never seen bronson better than here he really acts  and speaks french throughout with a heavy accent buy very passably indeed and it is certainly the man himself we hear so the french language version is highly recommended the police inspector who pursues the two is played by on of my favorite franch character actors bernard fresson who was gene hackmans partner in french connection ii he is the best brainy police inspector i know also very good is former child actress brigitte fossey as the young ingénue who as it turns out is not so innocent as it first seemsanyone who expects the old inanout of classical heist movies might be disappointed with this film for those with a little patience this will be a rewarding experience full of novel and original ideas and directorial quirks although it my be a little too brutal and sadistic for its own sake,1
395,i saw this a couple of nights back not expecting too much and unsurprisingly it did not deliver anything too exciting the plot set up of a crew of vampire hunters vsan for vampire sanitation going around in their spaceship periodically killing space vamps and rescuing people is quite sound and had the film been handled better it might well have been something quite ace unfortunately after a fairly decent opening the sense of actual quality starts to drain away from the film leaving something behind that though vacantly watchable is quite laughably bad i do not expect anything too special from these films that pop up on the sci fi channel and at least this was not one of their creature features with an atrocious cgi beast shambling about but it was still pretty bad mostly due to the writing and acting but with a sterling contribution to the overall badness made by the horrible music when the film opted just for a typical science fiction sounding weird noises approach to the soundtrack it did ok but all too often hilariously bad soft rock intruded and pitched scenes into silliness i would have tolerated the general cheesy acting and writing more were it not for the choice of music which was a serious miscalculation turning things from cheesy to lamely comical of the acting dominic zamprogna was ok but bland as the nominal hero whilst leanne adachi was pretty irritating as the tough girl of the vamp busting team and aaron pearl played another member who was not well written or interesting enough to make an impression though she did not seem that good at the acting lark natassia malte did well through having a less irritating character than the others and the fact that she is seriously nice to look at the only serious name in the cast is michael ironside and he is underused though he does nicely pretty amusing in a manner one suspects was intentional he seems to have fun and earn his paycheck and his role is entertaining the effects are ok on the whole they are at least of the standards of the average science fiction tv show and there are also a few scenes of blood splatter and a bit of fun gore as well things move along nicely and i almost feel harsh rating this film badly but then i remember bursting into laughter at regular intervals and realising that unless the film is an intentional comedy which i do not think it is then it simply does not succeed too much is lame daft unconvincing its an ok effort i guess but it did not appeal to me only give it a go if you really dig sci fi trash or unintended chuckles i would say,0
396,i have never seen many online movies in most of my life but if i would pick any of them i would pick spatula madness a clever reference to most movies like star trooper etc using a camera and wits of steel jason steele mastered the art of turning a normal image into a painting and then putting it all together with framebyframe animation to get a world inhabited by spatulas the story begins at the middle how is that for directors delight then the middle is at the beginning and so on when i first watched it i expected a soggy pixely look but jason like me loves looks so took every detail to the max although i do not recommend it for children or would anybody besides me like it but please search it up on the net its a short film look up film cow its style reminds me of south park but less violent ten for the look six for the laughs and six for the story it all comes to a tenten good workjason steele i am anxious to see the movie,1
397,hello this movie iswellokay just kidding its awesome it is not a block buster smash hit it is not meant to be but its a big hit in my world and my sisters we are rockin rollers go ramones this is a great movie for me,1
398,before we begin i have a fear of dentists this movie gives me the creeps and even makes me cringe that is what i love about this film the movie is kind of boring for that i take three stars offspoiler alertthe movie revolves around dr alan feinstone who has just found out his wife has been cheating on him soon he begins to have hallucinations and begins torturing his patients killing coworkers and he has even tortured his wife to death and killed the man he was having an affair withend spoiler the movie is very bloody and gory i would recommend it if you are into gorei give this film seven stars out of ten dr alan feinstein is not your normal everyday dentist,1
399,an independent feature can now be seen as both a work of film art and a video resume enter broken and aggressively promoted twenty minute short with style and enthusiams to spare but is it any good as a film or does it only work as a demo piece ah there in lies the rubbroken is the story of bonnie clayton who is abducted after awakening from a reoccurring nightmare one night by a sadistic stranger and his colorful entourage quote from the video box as she is held captive it becomes obvious that her abductors know things about her that even she did not know about herself while they question her a blackclad soldier guns his way into their hideout in an attempt to rescue her mayhem ensuesfortunately for us director alex ferrari seems to know what he is doing or at least he is very good at faking it broken does not suffer from any lack of visual flair which is especially commendable considering its budget and the inexperience of all involved what it does suffer from is weak and kind of derivative writing think long kiss goodnight meets the matrix written ten minutes after reading fight club the good news for ferrari and producerwriter jorge rodriguez is that the story elements are easily ignored for the oodles of eye candy on display does the plot really matter that much in a twenty minute short meant to show off the technical skills of its creators no not reallythough it would be unfair of me to overlook any negative aspects in light of the films budget and length broken is no genre classic the biggest problem was that it actually would have worked better as a fulllength feature the final twist does not get enough build up time to be shocking if ferrari were allowed the time to slow burn the feature as needed plot elements would seem less random and the film more complete here is to knowing he is getting the chanceaudio brokens dolby digital fiveone presentation is second to none in the indie world i have never heard such aggressive surround from such a small feature the matrix inspired soundtrack is very rich and deep gunshots have punch and even the dialogue gets in on the surround effects of everything presented on this disc it is the audio that speaks the praise for modern independent dvd production also included is an equally impressive dolby twozero surround track which is the menu defaultextras there are literally hours of making of features to be found on this disc there are so many extras in fact that i find it unrealistic to list and describe each of them here while still expecting my readers to continue reading whatever shortcomings the actual short may have the dvd is unprecedented in its informational resources people who enjoyed the film can learn all there is to know about its production including everything from the conceptual art to the promotional campaign those with plans to make an indie film of their own can learn just about everything they need to know from these featuresthe extras are broken down into categorical menus these include preproduction production postproduction after the short and cast and crew bios from a critical standpoint i found that some of the sections were quite short had they been edited into one featurette per menu option they would have been less frustrating to navigate as the curser defaults to the top selection with every return to the main section menu this is of course just nitpicking but perhaps for future dvd releases the filmmakers will take my advice to heartit has six audio commentaries and hours of interview footage and talented people and despite the consonant salesmanship their true colours do shine throughthe willingness to share their filmmaking secrets with anyone who picks up this dvd is quite generous from the extras i learned what editing and effects software is most reliable and effective what brand of camera creates the most professional look for the lowest price even where to get cheap air soft weaponry on top of this i was given several alternate options in case i found myself unable to locate any products used on this particular production wannabe filmmakers unwilling to read a book on the subject would do well to watch this dvdoverall i have scored the actual short as a six out of ten but wish there was an option for feature length potential and effort because i would have scored it an eight or nine in these fields i recommend the dvd for its features and as a perfect example of what can be done with a mere eight thousand american dollars those who purchase the dvd can think of themselves as ghost producers for a larger project as the more attention these guys get the more funding the featurelength version will get,1
400,deliverance is a stunning thriller every bit as exciting as any good thriller should aspire to be but also stomachchurningly frightening though it is not a horror movie it is just as terrifying as any classic horror film the very thought of being a normal redblooded male enjoying an adventure weekend miles from any form of civilisation only to be captured and sodomised by a couple of violent hillbillies is surely the worst nightmare of ninetyninenine of the worlds population it would have been easy for deliverance to slip into exploitation territory but john boorman has cleverly avoided the temptation to go down such a route and has made a film that explores questions and challenges the very meaning of masculinity with so many films you come away wishing to heaven that you could step into the heros shoes performing heroic deeds and saving the day and getting the girl but with deliverance you come away praying to god that you will never have to experience what these four protagonists go throughfour city guys  ed jon voight lewis burt reynolds drew ronny cox and bobby ned beatty  head out into the wilderness to spend a few days canoing down a soontobedammed river the guys are riding the rapids in pairs and ed and bobby inadvertently get a little too far ahead of the others so they pull in to the riverside and await their pals in the adjacent woodland here they fall foul of two local woodlanders bill mckinney and herbert coward who tie ed to a tree while one of them strips and rapes bobby instructing him perversely to squeal like a pig lewis and drew arrive unseen and lewis being a fair archer kills the rapist while the other hillbilly beats a hasty retreat into the forest under great emotional stress the four canoeists decide to conceal the event and get out of the area but they find the river increasingly dangerous to negotiate as they journey downstream and the risk to their lives heightens when the surviving hillbilly returns to take shots at them with his rifle from some unseen vantage point in the rocky cliffs beside the riverdeliverance is very powerful as a survival tale but even more powerful and disturbing as a study of macho attitudes being torn apart and left in humiliated tatters though all the performances are remarkable one must take particular note of beattys efforts in a role that many actors would have turned down the film is very similar thematically to the one thousand nine hundred and seventyone film straw dogs  both films deal with terrifying sexual violence in isolated locales and in both the eventual violent revenge exacted by the victim does not result in any sense of satisfaction the backdrop of the rugged countryside in deliverance is beautiful to look at but it also adds to the tension by placing the four canoeists in a setting where they are at the mercy of the hillbillies and the landscape with nobody to rely on other than themselves this truly is suspenseful filmmaking at its finest,1
401,that reviewers liked this movie surprises me the plot is a muddle the characters are wooden michael bowen spends most of the film spying on the other characters and misjudging all of them no one has any redeeming quality or pointofinterest this is not an edgy work it is not imaginative it is not ironic it is no clever there is nothing straight forward about this tedious work that is missed theatrical release is not surprise that the this network airs it diminishes that venue i definitely recommend turning to a rerun of the garden smart show on pbs or even a good informational if you encountered this mess on late night television if you encounter it on daytime television take a long walk even if you walk in smog you will feel better not having suffered through this shambles life is short this movie is long,0
402,i really liked this movieit was cute i enjoyed it but if you did not that is your fault emma roberts played a good nancy drew even though she is not quite like the books the old fashion outfits are weird when you see them in modern times but she looks good on them to me the rich girls did not have outfits that made them look rich i mean it looks like they got all the clothes blindfolded at a garage sale and just decided to put it on all together all of the outfits were tacky especially when they wore the penny loafers with their regular outfits i do not want to make the movie look bad because it definitely was not just go to the theater and watch it you will enjoy it,1
403,people i know is a clunker with no one to root for and no one to care about  despite the game efforts of a talented castpacino delivers his usual tour de force as eli wurman a pasthisprime publicity agent hollowed out by a lifetime of moral corruption but unlike michael corleone it is impossible to have an emotional investment in this character his dilemma or his fatethe film traces elis preparations for a benefit for a liberal political because while distracted by a clients ryan oneal good in an underwritten part latest dirty laundry  in this case a tv actress companion who is gotten involved with the wrong people tea leoni brings her customary star power to this supporting role although again the script does not give her much to work with as elis sisterinlaw kim basinger manages to evoke sympathy despite implausible plot mechanicsthis movie is strictly for those who like watching pacino strut his stuff and enjoy the other principals unfortunately between the script and direction people i know is strictly amateurish hence its limited theatrical release and speedy journey to dvd consider yourself warned,0
404,i can see why this film was oscarnominated for best live action short as it was constructed masterfully even if you do not particularly like the blues though to me this sounded much more like jazz you can easily appreciate this film it is simply very well made though for the life of me i cannot see why director gjon mili only got to direct one filmthis one in other words the film is nominated and yet the director did not get any sort of career boost as for the black performers i could understand this not causing their careers to shift into high gear as unfortunately most of white society have indifference or worse for blacks or that kind of musicif you do watch this film if you are not particularly enjoying the earlier portion skip ahead to about the fivefifty markwhere it picks up considerably when the lady stopped singing and the performers began to improvise the pace improved quite a bit,1
405,this is a film of immense appeal to a relatively welldefined group of which i am not a part i went to a preview of this movie not knowing what to expect  i ultimately found it disappointing the history of a dreadfully dysfunctional oftentimes downright twisted hungarian jewish family is not my cup of tea an epic saga like this should really provide its viewers with something more in the end ultimately pictures such as this are about the human condition  this picture cast almost no new light on any of its more meaningful facets,0
406,i have zero interest rap and in ghetto culture i am white and like classic rock however that did not stop me from appreciating this fantastic comedy its pretty much a sequel of this is spinal tap in the sense that it is the same movie just about rap instead or rock yet it is hilarious there are many funny jokes but not without a few jokes that just fall flat the characters are all very funny and believable i watched just because it made me laugh at three am and any movie that can do that warrants at least a test screening one of the reasons why this movies was so funny was that it makes fun of rap from a different rap today is concerned with the wrong things and get by with studio noise and little talent this movie comes from a time where rappers deserved more credit overall it is a funny movie with many jokes about racism sex and music culture among the more obvious themes of humor this is highly recommend for any fan of this is spinal tap they are essentially the same movie just about different worlds and yes the same jokes work in both movies,1
407,i am not entirely sure rob schmidt qualifies as a master in the genre of horror since he previously just directed one horror film called wrong turn and that one was actually just was slightly above mediocre but fact is that he made with right to die one of the best and creepiest episodes of the entire second season of the masters of horror franchise there was a similar underdog story in season one when william malone made on of the best episodes with the fair haired child even though his other long feature films fear dot com and house on haunted hill sucked pretty badlythe story of right to die cleverly picks in on the nowadays piping hot social debate of euthanasia but thankfully also features multiple oldfashioned horror themes like ghostly vengeance murderous conspiracies pitch black humor and comic book styled violence whilst driving home late one night and discussing the husbands continuous adultery the addison couple are involved in a terrible car accident cliff walks away from the wreck unharmed but his wife abby is fully burned and needs to be kept alive artificially whilst cliff and his sleazy attorney corbin bernsen of the dentist want to plug the plug on her and sue the car constructor abbeys mum sets up a giant media campaign to keep her daughter alive as a vegetable and blame everything on cliff meanwhile abbeys hateful spirit comes back for revenge and kills someone in cliffs surrounding whenever she has a near fatal experience with the medical devices after a few victims cliff realizes it might be safer for him to keep his wife alive if he wants to remain alive as well right to die is a stupendous episode and exactly the type of stuff i always hoped to see from a tvseries concept like masters of horror it is violent and gory with a sick  twisted sense of humor and loads of sleaze sequences the euthanasia theme and the whole obligatory media circus that surrounds it is processed into the script very well yet without unnecessarily reverting to political standpoints or morality lessons the atmosphere is suspenseful and the killing sequences are suitably nasty and unsettling actresses julia anderson and robin sydney both have pretty face and impressively voluptuous racks which is always a welcome plus and corbin bernsen is finally offered the chance again to depict a meanspirited and egocentric bastard great moh episode definitely one of the highlights of both seasons,1
408,i will admit that i did not give this movie much of a chance i decided pretty early on that this just was not my kind of moviefor the most part it has an excellent look in terms of its cinematography the scenes of early seventys manhattan look very good as does the lead actress it is a very crisp black and white which could almost make the movie feel undated and fresh however some of the other techniques the filmmakers employ shoot that prospect all to hell the disjointed editing is very latesixtys somewhere between surrealism and new wave the story also feels like it came from a very specific time somewhere between free love idealism and artsy experimentationthe film follows a young girl around the city as she looks for a man who she had anonymous phone sex with as she meets other odd characters she reveals her quirks and they reveal theirs the movie seems to be meant as an offthewall irreverent comedy but adds an avantgarde feel i would expect that if you like andy warhol movies you would be very excited to discover the telephone booksome problems i had near the end of the movie one character tells a rambling anecdote that lasts over twelve minutesbrutal to sit through also there is a very explicit animation sequence that i found gross and juvenile that serves as the films climax i did laugh out loud four or five times and i liked the ending minus the flatout disgusting animation and when the film switched to color for the final phoneboothatnight sequence i actually liked the way it looked even better it ended up being one of those experiences where i felt like i could have really liked it if it been a little different but this is what the filmmakers gave us it is obscure artsy and way left of the dial but none of those are reasons to recommend it on their own i did not find it to be unique or creative so much as forced and pretentious,0
409,some people loved the aristocrats and others hated it frequently walking out in the middle reactions to eddie izzard are not likely to be that extreme  if you can handle a transvestite comedian who says he likes girls and has a vocabulary that makes shall we say enough use of the f word that his program would be one long beep if presented on network television many of izzards fans are so devoted that they see no flaws whatsoever in his performances on the other hand i thought this show was occasionally flatter than izzards chest but also more often than not funny and in spots absolutely hilarious he has a way of connecting references from routines early in the show to his later routines he is not a story teller he is not a joke maker he is not a frenetic fantasist like robin williams he plays around with ideas some of which work and some of which  a routine with the san francisco cable car and alcatraz for instance  are completely unfunny he has a way however of moving gracefully past the flopped routines and extending the ones that connect i gave this performance a seven and might be persuaded to raise it to an eight but a ten no way,1
410,eleven oscar nominations and zero win am yet to understand why  its not like the actors in the movie did any better thereafter that you can make it by giving them awards for trivial roles like it was done with halle berry and denzel washington  whoopi oprah margaret avery danny glover etc were all amazing  i am curious to get scripts of the discussions at the oscars that year it should go into the shouldawould havecoulda category for the judges its an amazing book  but true to alice walkers style of writing she has a way of seeming like she is exaggerating her characters  so i am so glad that they screen adaptation took a few things out the cinematography was amazing  the african scenes live much to be desired  the african part in the book is supposed to be set in liberia  somewhere in west africa  but oh no steven spielberg thinks the world is so dumb that they cannot think of africa outside of the safaris  so yes there had to be a complimentary zebra and wildlife scene when we all know there are none west africa  and most of all why get the people to speak swahili  who in west africa speaks swahili i just had to get that out of the waybut as a story  amazing filmmaking  out of this world  classic yesi own it and i watch it when my soul needs some rejuvenation,1
411,i have read the book a couple of times and this movie does not follow exactly as it should i could let this slide it is after all a movie however i have serious issues with the setting of the movie nobody has seemed to mention that this movie and the book it is based on are based in actual events that happened in nebraska i live in nebraska i grew up in the town that this movie is supposed to be based on first of all the small town that is talked about as the setting is the third largest city in the state with a population of around fiftyzero grand island is the largest city between lincoln and denver second the scenery for the movie is wrong grand island is in the platte river valley which is very flat with very few trees i tried watching this movie but it made me mad to see my hometown being treated so bad this was a real event large sections of the city were wiped out in the book they talk about riding bikes from mormon island to fonner park i guess you could if you do not mind a fifteen mile ride each way for anyone who wants to know what really happened go here ,0
412,this is one powerful film the first time i saw it the scottish accents made it tough for me to understand a lot and that ruined the viewing experience i gave up on it but then acquired the dvd used the english subtitles when i needed them and really got into this movie discovering just how good it is it is excellentthe widescreen picture makes it spectacular in parts with some wonderful rugged scenery and the story reminded me of braveheart an involving tale of good versus evil here it is liam neeson good vs tim roth evil both do their jobs wellfew actors come across as despicable as roth man you really want to smack this guy in his arrogant irritating puss he is so nasty and vile the sick critics love his character more than anyone elses here neeson is a mans man and a solid hero figure as gibson was in braveheart jessica lange is strong in here as the female lead the movie draws you in and gets you totally involved so prepared to have an emotional experience viewing this,1
413,why is it that any film about cleopatra the last phaoroh brings out the worst in movie making whatever attraction the woman had for the greatest roman of them all julius ceasar and his successor mark anthony never seems to come across on the screen as other than the antics of over sexed high school seniors despite lavish sets and costumes this movie is as bad as any italian sandals and toga extravaganza of the fiftys admittedly this kind of spectacular belongs on the big screen which is why gladiator went over well but gladiator did not have all the romance novel sexmiss varela has as little acting talent as elizabeth taylor but timothy dalton has talent to spare pity some of it did not wash off on the others,0
414,whenever people ask me to name the scariest movie i have ever seen i invariably reply black noon and to this day nobodys ever heard of iti watched it alone some thirty years ago at the tender age of thirteen when my parents had gone out for the evening as far as i know its only ever been shown once in the uk and sadly is unavailable on dvd or vhsif anyone can trace a copy please let me knowif i watched it again now it would probably be a big disappointment but it has always stuck in my memory as a particularly disturbing little film,1
415,i was really looking forward to this movie based on the previews and press it received but after viewing it i was terribly disappointed slums is a totally unfunny film mixed with a todd solondz type of disturbing family reality sans todds brand of humor the story drags along and each scene is worse than the last maybe i missed the point but if this film is an example of every girls growing up experience i am glad to be a man,0
416,when thinking about captivity many words come to mind among them are uninteresting unentertaining unsuspensful unsexy unfathomable and unwatchablei used to hate those movies from the mid to late nineties that were basically ripoffs of scream but these new saw knockoffs are beginning to make those films look like classics they still pander to the same demographic that those other movies were so successful at doing but now they add a new level of degeneracy that make the twelve to fourteen year old girls they are aimed at feel like they are hardcore and hipthis movie is a load of boring crap what the hell has happened to larry cohen his name has not been attached to anything good since one thousand nine hundred and ninetythree even so i was still surprised to see that he had anything to do with something this bad was anyone surprised when the movies love interest turned out to be one of the psychopaths did anyone not know it when they first saw him only someone who has never before in his or her life ever seen another movie,0
417,this is one of the shallowest episodes in that the plot really seemed like an excuse to just have fun but i appreciated this lighthearted approach and this is truly one of the best episodes to see on a purely fun level think about itthe crew members have encounters with the white rabbit and alice from wonderland a bengal tiger a samurai warrior a knight on horseback who kills mccoy and a host of other seemingly bizarre events that just do not make any sense at all until the very end despite all the danger you just cannot take everything very seriouslyit is just too fun and the whole episode seems very surreal so on a purely nonaesthetic level it is great stuff,1
418,normally i am not the sort to be scared by horror movies but this movie is the exception some how this movie got into my mind it is a very simple movie but at the same time extremelly effective it has great atmosphere and this leads to some shocking moments the girls father coming down the hill is a real standout another seen was the family photo i was not expecting that and i jumped out my seat i would recommend everyone to see this movie with the lights out it will stay with you for a long time,0
419,the premise may seem goofy but since murphys character does not take it seriously it helps ease the audience into this mix of mysticism and modernday hardboiled child abduction excellent cast particularly charles dance and charlotte lewis and murphy is at the height of his eightys peak in comedyaction there is also some great fx a very surreal dream sequence and a fairly original plot often overlooked in the pantheon of murphy flicks but this one is worth a look,1

421,return of the jedi is often remembered for what it did wrong rather than what it did right and that is a shame because the last chronological installment in the star wars saga is a shining example of epic storytelling it manages to wrap up all story lines of the previous movies in one grand finale and does so very convincinglyyes there are ewoks  cute and cuddly bears that arguably served to broaden the star wars demographic  and in the middle the movie tends to slow down a bit but the final hour is arguably the best piece of the entire saga where luke finally comes face to face with darth vader the most recognizable villain in movie historyreturn of the jedi did so many things right that people tend to overlook it presented an incredible conclusion to the darth vader storyline which went from slightly implausible in the empire strikes back to very convincing here an exciting opening at jabbas palace a masterful performance of ian mcdiarmid as the emperor luke finally coming into his own the resolution of solo and leias romance and the extremely powerful final moments on the endor moonyes there are slight annoyances but they are the annoyances of a generation of moviegoers who have had time to nitpick every single scene it is still a magical and moving piece of cinema that also serves as a great final chapter it is not a good movie  it is fantastic,1
422,the us appear to run the uk police who all run around armed to the teeth and did you know that cid officers change into uniform when they stop work and go down the pub this has got to be one of the most unrealistic films with the worst portrayal of real uk police that has ever been foisted on the unsuspecting public i can see that mr snipes might have needed the money to pay his back tax bill but what the heck a good actor like charles dance was doing in it is a mysteryworse than the worse low budget b film of the fiftys an hour and a half of suicide and time i will never get backavoid it like the veritable plague,0
423,i do not often go out of my way to write comments but for this i had to just to warn anyone that might think that by watching this they will see a comedy this does not come close while the premise change in colourgenderwhatever is bad enough and has been done better many times beforethe actual transformation of two black guys into two white girls is one of the least convincing transformations ever put on screen it would be bad enough if all that was required by the script was a change to white chicks however the wayans brothers are required to disguise themselves as two specific white women as you will have guessed by now they fail completely i have seen drag queens without makeup make more convincing women than these two do with the best special effects and makeup people that hollywood can provide its appalling add to the mix a basketball player built like a building terrible dialogue and more plot holes than a golf course and this film hits a new personal low and i like bad movies avoid like the plague,0
424,too many sources routinely lump this thoughtprovoking period drama in part based on historical fact together with the superficially similar nunsploitation which was a mainstay in seventys euro trash cinema overlooking the righteous anger that drives the whole endeavor perhaps coincidentally it was also director gianfranco mingozzis singular attempt at narrative filmmaking outside of many wellreceived documentariessafely set within a historical context flavia charts the growing rebellion of an early fifteenth century italian nun florinda bolkans career performance even surpassing her sterling work in lucio fulcis devastating do not torture a duckling locked away in convent by her not so nobleman father in a desperate attempt to curb the girls budding sensuous nature wondering why women are relegated to secondary roles at best in life as in holy scripture she is confronted by ways in which male domination can rupture female lives inspiring revolt fueled by the ranting of semicrazed older sister agatha indelibly portrayed by veteran actress maria casarès from marcel carnés les enfants du paradis and  more constructively  by a muslim invasion joining the oppressors and perhaps unwittingly manipulating them to do her bidding flavia truly becomes the outcast she already felt herself to be with expected tragic resultswith its breathtaking widescreen compositions by alfio contini who shot michelangelo antonionis zabriskie point this is an uncompromising and austere account of one womans fierce yet ultimately futile fight against patriarchal society which allotted her no rights beyond childbearing or whoring as sister agatha wryly remarks a lengthy druginduced fantasy sequence clearly modeled on ken russells otherwise far more flamboyant devils notwithstanding the movie turns out relatively stingy in the skin department making something of a mockery out of its semiporn reputation this is a serious work deserving rediscovery and restoration of its unjustly tarnished reputation,1
425,despite the title the sword bearer and the dvd cover actionherioc poses of the sword bearer this is not a super hero filmminor spoilers it follows the tale of sasha the sword bearer who is cursed with having a retractable sword in his forearm cool you say but no this is real life if you had this power as a child could you control it when say faced by a mad man or when your mums boyfriend is beating her and if you do not control it how do you cope with being a two time killer at the age of twelvethis essentially is where sasha is when we meet him wandering aimlessly after another killing much like a bout de soufflé he then meet katya and the pair fall instantly in love providing sasha with a real reason to live and try and changes his ways however his past is still chasing him in the form of two police officersthat is essentially the story and there is virtually no action on screen though a lot if suggestedi really like this movie unlike many hollywood super hero films we get very little back story there is no bad guy unless you count the sword bearer himself abut there is a lot of heart and good character developmentworth checking out if you can find it,1
426,strangely enough this movie never made it to the big screen in denmark so i had to wait for the video release my expectations where high but they where in no way disappointed as always with ang lee there is fantastic acting an intelligent and thrilling plot that has you guessing right till the end and superb filming along with unforgiven this is easily one of the two best westerns of the ninetyspeople who expect something along the line of mel gibson in the patriotcorny or braveheartacceptable will be sourly disappointed all others who appreciate the above mentioned qualities will have a fantastic time watching it nine out of ten,1
427,before i go on i have to admit to being a huge bon jovi fan in fact that is what attracted me to the dvd case in the first place i probably would have bought it anyway being such a big horror fan and having enjoyed the first vampires title so muchbut this is not half as good not even jon could save this film for me my main problem would be that it simply is not scary apart from jons character derek bliss none of the other characters make an impression and you could not care less whether they die or not especially the annoying vampire  drug addict woman the female vampire simply is not scary or sexy rather she looks like an anorexic fourteen year girl no wonder she is so desperate for blood then another huge problem is that everything is just too bright there is no atmosphere or sense of dread i know the first vampires being set in new mexico was not exactly the twilight zone in terms of creepiness but yet it still managed to be dark and foreboding when it needed to be this film has no tension like thatthe story is basically the same as before vampire wants berziers cross to be able to walk in daylight however the story has less cool bits this time there is no wow factor in knowing this is the master of all master  the original vampire as in the first film you really do not care who or what this one is there is no army of masters instead she hides out in some old ruin which looks more like a disneyland attraction then a creepy templeso there you have it really lack of scares lack of atmosphere lack of interesting story a real let down for me personally,0
428,william powells final outing as philo vance occurs in the kennel murder case where the murder of a championship show dog leads to two more murders and one attempt of the human kind it is all in the figuring out of how that leads to the who and whythe philo vance murders by ss van dine were most popular at the time and the clever mr van dine figured out a way to sell his books one at a time to the highest studio bidder this is why you see so many philo vances and so many studios putting them out had bill powell not gone on to greater fame with mgm as nick charles of the thin man series he would have been known as the greatest of philo vances it turns out that powell had entered his little terrier captain in the same contest where the murdered dog was entered and then another rival owner became the first murder victim as usual powell shows up eugene palette as sergeant heath whose biggest contribution to the proceedings was using his bulk to break down the locked from the inside door where the first murder victim was foundi did say locked from the inside and it was an upper story so it was in figuring out the how powell has a lovely group of suspects as extensive as what normally is in a thin man mystery people like paul cavanaugh helen vinson ralph morgan mary astor fill their cast roles wellwarner brothers liked this version so much that in fact they remade it again in the thirties with james stephenson in his one and only outing as philo vance it does not hold a candle to this oneas this is the only powell philo vance that is out on vhs or dvd by all means see this one or acquire it if you can,1
429,this series is set a year after the mission to abydos in the movie stargate it explains a lot of the stuff that the movie neglected to mention such as how was the stargate activated without a human computer where did the goauld ras race come from how many are there the first episode has a retired jack oneill spelled with two ls recalled to active duty by general george hammond due to an attack by the shut down stargate from apophis a powerful goauld who killed four men and kidnapped one woman we meet samantha carter a brilliant scientist who claims that she should have gone through the stargate the first time and is determined to go through now we find out that daniel got married on abydos and that there are hundreds of gate addresses that they can dial then daniels wife gets captured by apophis and becomes his new queen it continues in the second episode where general hammond announces the formation of the sgc which includes nine teams in which jacks team will be sgone which consists of jack samantha and daniel they go to chulak a goauld homeworld to rescue daniels wife and another one captured at abydos named skara they get captured and just as apophis gives the order to kill them and many other prisoners a jaffa named tealc first prime of apophis saves them and goes to earth with them where he is made part of sgone that was only the beginning of the adventure in the course of the show they have gone to the past and future gotten transported to alternate realities swapped bodies grown old met alien races which include a rebel alliance of goauld called the tokra in which samanthas dad becomes a member the asgard a cute little race in which we see thor most often he is jacks buddyand avoid global disaster by the skin of their teeth countless timesthe show was recently canceled but lasted ten seasons in season nine a new enemy called the ori came in flaunting brand new powers new dangers and bringing to light new mysteries surrounding the stargate and its creators the ancients season nine and ten also saw the introduction to two new characters ben browder as cameron mitchell the new leader of sgone and claudia black as vala maldoran a female human from another world who brings a new sense of fun to the team very wellproduced interesting characters fantastic special effects and a subtle love interest between samantha and jack this one has it all a different way of travelling the galaxy and different kinds of adventures this is one show you do not want to miss unlock the gate and step through you will not regret it,1
430,there is so many negative reviews about stay away joe in here i just cannot stay quiet any longer and let this injustice happen here is a side you have not heard yetelvis presleys movies are my guilty pleasure for a simple reason they are perfect films for a pure relaxation because i do not have to think when i watch them that means i do not have to worry about missing a complex plot because there never is a proper plot to start with i can just kick off my shoes grab a beer sit back switch off my brains and enjoy all the general wackiness and catchy easygoing rock n roll tunes from the grooviest decade of them allin my books stay away joe definitely falls into the so bad it is goodcategory now if you are like me and appreciate the trash value this is the ultimate one thousand nine hundred and sixtys camp experience it is so bad that it is almost surrealistic to watch and just when you think that it cannot possibly get any worse it surprises you in the most imaginable ways in the end you are so amazed by all the new levels of stupidity you just do not know whether to laugh or cry in a nutshell i love it because it is so damn amusing that there once was a generation that actually made films like this i still give it one out of ten though  once it hits the bottom one hundred it will became an instant bad movie classic,0
431,this sports a nice deep cast but for a thriller you better deliver more than name actors and talk the first third of this movie was nothing but talk and more talk most of that was a bunch of women bitching about everything to each other the first five listed actors in here are women so that verifies that it is really a chick flick and little else this probably plays on the lifetime networkthere was a quick murder scene and then more talk by halfway through they had lost me by the way sally field looked about fifteen years old in here,0
432,i did not think the french could make a bad movie but i was clearly very wrong as has been said before this film essentially uses its title character as a point of departure its portrayal of her life and person have little or nothing to do with the real artemisia gentileschi the script is awful  pretentious stilted and vapid  and its rewriting of the facts is unusually offensive even in a genre that all too often makes its living by distorting rather than retelling history along with some fairly decent set design valentina cervis physical charms are the primary asset of this movie and it is obvious from the beginning that the filmmakers were aware of this too they waste no time in contriving various erotic sequences which have far more to do with titillation than with plot or character development unfortunately the appeal of seeing a pretty young girl in a state of feigned sexual arousal cannot and does not sustain this movie the acting is unremarkable and the score is all too generic despite an interesting chord or two the cinematography is ok and there are some pretty colors but there are also some pretty ridiculous sequences using distortedlens effects more appropriate for a one thousand nine hundred and sixtys freakout movie than a costume drama in any event the script leaves the camera dwelling all too often on artemisias body and all too seldom on her paintingsall told a nearcomplete failure it is not intelligent or tasteful enough to be a serious film and it is too slow and pretentious to work as softcore pornography so the french can fail after all,0
433,things to come is that rarity of rarities a film about ideas many films present a vision of the future but few attempt to show us how that future came about the first part of the film when war comes to everytown is short but powerful ironically film audiences in its release year laughed at reports that enemy planes were attacking englandappeasement was at its height wells prediction was borne out all too soon the montage of endless war that follows while marred by subpar model work is most effective the explanatory titles are strongly reminiscent of german expressionist graphic design the art director was the great william cameron menzies and his sets of the ruins of everytown are among his best work margaretta scott is very seductive as the chiefs mistress the everytown of the twentyonest century is an equally striking design the acting in the twentyonest century story is not compellingperhaps this was a misfired attempt to contrast the technocratic rationality of this time with the barbarism of one thousand nine hundred and seventy unfortunately the model work representing angry crowds rushing down elevated walkways is laughably bad and could have been done much better even with thirtys technology this is particularly galling since the scenes of the giant aircraft are very convincing this is redeemed by raymond masseys magnificent speech that concludes the filmrarely has the ideal of scientific progress been expressed so well masseys final question is more relevant now than ever in an era of severely curtailed manned spaceflight the scene is aided by the stirring music of sir arthur bliss whose last name i proudly shareunfortunately the vhs versions of this film are absolutely horrible with serious technical problems most versions have edited out a rather interesting montage of futuristic workers and machines that takes us from one thousand nine hundred and seventy to two thousand and thirtyeight i hope a good dvd exists of the entire film,1
434,this film like astaires royal wedding  which was shown after it on turner classic network last night is famous for a single musical sequence that has gained a place in gene kellys record like fred astaire dancing with a clothing rack and later dancing around a rooms walls and ceiling this film had gene kelly dancing in a cartoon sequence with jerry mouse the sequence is nicely done what is forgotten is that kelly is telling the story behind the cartoon sequence to dean stockwell and his fellow child students at school during a break in the day and sets the stage for the sequence by having stockwell and the others shut their eyes and imagine a pastoral type of background kelly even changes the navy blues he actually wears into a white pomeranian navy uniform with blue stripes on it jerry mouse does more than dance with gene he actually talks  a first that he did not repeat for many decades he also finally puts tom cat into his proper place  tom briefly appears as king jerrys butler trying to cheer him with a platter of cheesesbut the sequence of the cartoon with kelly took about seven minutes of the movie far more of this peculiar film is taken up with kellys story of the lost four day furlough in hollywood and how kelly ends up meeting katherine grayson and with frank sinatra stalking jose iturbi at the mgm film studio the hollywood bowl and iturbis own home except that the two sailors mean no harm this film could have been quite disturbingkelly has saved sinatras life in the pacific and is getting a medal as a result they are both among the crewmen back in california who are getting a four day leave but the script writers to propel what would be a short film  kelly has plans to spend four days having sex with one lola an unseen good time girl in hollywood saddle gene with frank it seems frank is one of those idiots that appear in film after film of the movie factories particularly musical comedies who are socially underdeveloped and in need of instruction about meeting girls or guys if the characters are women frank insists that gene help teach him how to get a girl just then a policeman takes them to headquarters to help the cops with a little boy stockwell who insists on joining the navy and will not give the cops his real name and address when a protesting kelly is able to get this information out of stockwell by asking him some straight questions which the cops could not ask they insist kelly take the boy home to his aunt grayson still protesting kelly gets saddled with increasingly complicated problems mostly due to sinatras simplistic soul view of things he misses seeing lola the next day by sleeping late  sinatra felt he looked so peaceful sleeping he did not wake him up he keeps getting dragged back to graysons house as sinatra feels she is the right woman for himself but needs kelly to train him in love makingi suppose my presentation of the plot may annoy fans of anchors aweigh but i find this kind of story irritating while the singing and dancing and concert music of kelly sinatra grayson and iturbi are first rate it is annoying to have to take the idiocies of someone like sinatras character seriously in the real world kelly would have beaten the hell out of him at the start for following him at the beginning of the four day furlough  what right has he to insist as sinatra does that someone who saves their life should assist him on learning how to date that kind of crap always ruins the total affects of a musical for me  unless the musical numbers are so superior as to make me forget this type of nonsensethe stalking of iturbi is likewise annoying kelly tries to get grayson to like sinatra when he says sinatra can get her a meeting with jose iturbi to audition her singing ability for much of the rest of the picture sinatra and kelly try to do that and keep floundering at one point  for no really good reason  grayson herself ruins kellys attempt to get an interview at mgm with iturbi it is only sheer luck that iturbi feels sorry for an embarrassed grayson that she does give him an audition of her talent kelly by the way ends up with grayson sinatras conscience at not being able to help her see iturbi makes him ashamed of his bothering her but not pulling kelly into it oddly enough and he meanwhile accidentally stumbles into meeting a waitress pamela britton from his native brooklyn and naturally without any assistance from kelly sinatra and britton fall in love ahconsistency thy name is not screenwriting necessarily,1
435,i never saw this movie until i bought the tape last year i was enthralled and entertained it has all the elements of what i love to see in a scifi story in a book or on the screen there is social commentary speculation and a good storythere is something eerie and amusing watching a one thousand nine hundred and thirtysix view of the distant future of the sixtys and seventysi think it is a must see and not only for scifiers,1
436,flame in flame out that seems to be gammera in a nutshell a prehistoric creature who can take it and dish it out with equal abandon i am not a fan of japanese monster films but wound up committed to viewing all the flicks on the fifty film dvd scifi collection put out by mill creektreeline films it is a great value at about twenty five bucks so at fifty cents per movie it really boils down to an investment in time to watch some of the goofy offeringsgammera is riled from a centuries long slumber by a nuclear blast and he is not happy like godzilla he takes it out on tokyo setting the united nations into motion to try and come up with a plan to save the planet they arrive at plan z the hope of the world and would not you know it there is a scene where a huge she would is shown that is called the z plan building that was a nice touchby the mid one thousand nine hundred and sixtys this country still was not quite politically correct one of the american military scenes at the alaskan air defense sector has general arnold asking a female sergeant to make coffee i guess there were not any privates aroundgood old gammera was quite the sight though walking around on two legs and going for the flame throwing routine when challenged that is why it surprised me how plan z managed to capture turtle man in the nose cone of a hidden space ship whisking him off to mars to save the world high fives all around for the american and russian team that made the save now let us get back to the cold warlike godzilla gammera spawned at least a good dozen films but having seen this one pretty much satisfies my interest in flying flaming turtles especially since that dvd pack i mentioned earlier has attack of the monsters with a featured guest appearance by the big g it took all i had to make it through to the end of both films it was such a relief to get to the final frame in this one that said gammera sayonara,0
437,you know i went to see the hills have eyes two wanting to like it i really enjoyed the original and the remake was fairly entertaining they obviously had more money to throw around than wes craven did on special effects the second time around even though i still prefer the original film the remake was done well and it was kind of a guilty pleasure for me bloody intense and great special effects in short a great popcorn movie for any horror fanwhich brings us to the hills have eyes two man where do i start the plot or lack of one is paper thin we are not exactly breaking new ground herethe military has decided to monitor the area and all of these people turn up missing so what do we do now let us send in the national guard to investigate in true hollywood fashion we need to make them the dumbest and worst soldiers ever seen gee i have never seen that premise before to make a long story short you have the mutants killing off the moron soldiers one at a time in graphic fashion once again the special effects by nicotero are great but the kills no matter how graphic become boring and predictable honestly it seemed to me that this flick was done just to grab a quick buck it was bloody and graphic but i found it predictable boring and not scary at all for me it would have been nice if this film contained one original thoughtwes craven and his son shared the writing duties and he has been involved with many of my favorite horror films but sadly this is not one of them,0
438,i bought the dvd of before sunset and saw it for the first time a week ago having saw it twice i could not help but missing before sunrise not because the sequel was not as great but i felt that these two movies completed each other like no other sequels ever did every time i finished watching one of them i feel the need and yearning to see the other so i ended up spending the weeks watching both of them repeatedly i will be quite embarrassed to mention how many times exactly the most remarkable thing about before sunrise is how you feel the development of the feelings of their characters towards each other it sounds so simple the growing of the chemistry i think other romantic films might think that they succeed to track the development but to me  who does not believe in nora ephron  before sunrise is the first film to really gives the viewers chance to feel it when i saw it for the first time about eight year ago when i was twenty i already liked it but i did not rate it as a great film it still seemed to me like another thinking persons feel good movie linklater was too smart to make it more realistic it was ten minutes too long the characters was too well fabricated i thought i liked it because it was like a dream and because i enjoyed their conversations etc etc but now thanks to before sunset i feel that is more to before sunrise than what i felt for it before i saw the elements more clearly jesse celine vienna their conversations everything how each of them are separated element by itself and they have a chance to mix the story is just a frame of time i am no longer feel manipulated and the freedom that every scene has as well as its refusal to be overly efficient how blind i was that those qualities did not strike me as exceptional when i first saw it now eight year have passed the more movies i have seen the more i realize that many movies are just collections of ordered scenes that only exist for the sake of its ending even movies like pulp fiction or linklaterss own slackers included the jesse and celine tale avoid that maybe before sunset is a better example in this case but before sunrise is also one of few films that its ending is just a consequence of time not a destination every single scene has its own life i do not know whether linklater or anyone else had a sequel in mind when they made before sunrise but to me one of the most amazing things about these sequels are how these two films visually contrast each other before sunrise which i think employs more static angels and brighter color schemes seems to try to capture the smallest atoms of liveliness surrounding jesse and celine the world is always full of hope whether or not the characters feel it meanwhile i enter the vision of boredom as jesse stuck talking to the journalists in before sunset and celines first smile from behind the shelves are the most heartbreaking smile i have seen in a beginning of a film and the many moving shots after that takes me to a place i do not know with a sadness in me no matter how beautiful paris is and no matter how happy i am that they meet again i am sorry that i go on this long with my limited english before sunrise is already an extraordinary film without me pouring my scattered thoughts and it gets even better with an equally great sequel following it,1
439,being the prototype of the classical errol flynn adventure movie and having a good story as well as two more brilliant costars in maureen ohara what an exquisite beauty and anthony quinn i can only recommend this movie to all those having even the slightest liking for romance and adventurehollywood at its best,1
440,first saw this movie in about one thousand nine hundred and ninety and absolutely died laughing through it it became a cult favorite with my circle of friends and we would quote from it at the drop of a hat i am going home in a bag needless to say the humor is still there fifteen years later it is become a tradition at halloween time to expose many of my new friends to this film good thing you can still buy it off ebay i have found that halloween candy tastes much better with your tongue planted firmly in your cheekand this movie provides it all pathos suspense unrequited lovenobility and the list goes on royal dano provides an amazing heartfelt performance as old man wrenchmuller i remember seeing him in the seven faces of dr lao as a bad guy who met a bad end here you really feel for the old guy right from the beginning if you are not careful you will miss some of the levels of humor in this movie the creators got real subtle in many ways with offhand comments little subtle costume digs at other scifi movies and even a scene ripped from the pages of wile e coyotedo not spend too much thought processes trying to analyze a movie people this is fun fare without the need for nitpicking and should not be offensive to anyone well maybe stupid people but they will not know they are being mockednow if you will excuse me i am going to go get a zagnut barramsay rc cowlishaw karaoke djentertainer,1
441,i wanted to read the other comments before leaving my review and the majority definately rules this movie is aweful from the acting to the nonrealistic animation to the countless errors i was actually hoping that the flaps would have been extended by a stretch of the imagination cannot extend flaps without engines the landing gear cannot be lowered unless you have electricity that tiny little fan that was going was not sufficient by any stretch to lower the landing gear the one thing i thought was quite peculiar is when they landed the back wheels touched down and then the nose one broke off thus suspending the plane with both back tires in the air how did the captain apply left and right brakes to tires that were not touching the ground did they forget the spoilers word to the director find out all you can about planes before attempting a plane movie sorry for the technical rant but i give this movie oneten,0
442,this documentary is a reenactment of the last few years of betty pagespaige richards career the tennessee tease was the most recognizable pinup queen in history her most memorable work came in the one thousand nine hundred and fiftys and was fetish photos bondage and catfight girly flicks irving klawdukey flyswatterat his movie star news instructed betty on what to do in front of the camera there was no nudity in the famous photos or stag films but nonetheless klaw was charged with distributing obscene materials and was ordered to destroy them to avoid prosecution it is no surprise that betty had a cult following at the height of her career the girlnextdoor with jet black hair blue eyes and an hour glass figure dressed in fetish gear or not would mesmerize for decades after all it has been said that she was photographed more than marilyn monroe and second only to the most photographed image in the world elvis presley betty page would disappear and devote her last years to religion this movie actually could have been a lot better but good enough to hold interestmiss richards is stunning in her own right bra panties garter belt and hose do not hurt her image in the least also in the cast jaimie henkin jana strain emily marilyn and julie simone be advised this movie can change your heart rate,0
443,i got to say that uma thurman is the sexiest woman on the planet this movie was uber cute and i mean uber cute it had all the sex content that most ivan reitman comedies have but with something a lil extra chemistry uma and luke both have this awkrawrd but believable chemistry that seem to transcend in each scene  both seem to create this odd twisted and interesting relationship with powerful sexual tension that you laugh until you cannot feel your face anymore anna farris and the rest of the supporting cast seem to play off each others roles perfectly and even wanda sykes rather small role will keep you laughing though these kind of comedies are not for everybody but i have to say i went with a person that does not usually enjoy these films and he was laughing like crazy this movie is certainly not for everyone especially younger children since some moments are little toowell let us say adult for younger viewers all in all i was pleasantly surprised by this movie tough the ending i found was a little weak compared to the rest of the film three onetwo out of five,1
444,this movie blows  let us get that straight right now there are a few scene gems nestled inside this pile of crap but none can redeem the limp plot colin farrel looks like brad pitt in twelve monkeys and acts in a similar manner i normally hate colin because he is a fairy in general but he is ok in this movie there were two plot lines in this movie one about a kid who throws rocks through windshields of moving vehicles and the other about a woman with a moustache let us face it this movie has no freaking idea of what it wanted to say or where it wanted to go the characters story lines intertwine on some levels but are in no means worthy of being included in a script the whole thing is weak and pointless and then there is an occasional ok scene but overall do not bother unless you love irish accents so much that you can watch mediocrity and it is rescued by everyone sounding like the lucky charms elf an american fetish that has catapulted some truly crappy movies to success,0
445,boring childrens fantasy that gives joan plowright star billing but little to do sappy kids pursue their dreams frankie wants to be a ballerina and a baseball player yuk while bestfriend hazel runs for mayorshe is thirteen totally pedestrian in every way plus the added disadvantage of syrupy performances by the girls as well as the baseball boys certainly a lesser effort for showtimeno limits,0
446,the threesome of bill boyd robert armstrong and james gleason play coney island carnys vying for the hand of ginger rogers a working gal who sells salt water taffy with the outbreak of world war i the threesome enlist and pursue ginger from afar the first half of this rko pathe production is hard going with the three male leads chewing up the scenery with overcooked oneliners and snappy dialogue that quickly grows tiresome the second half concentrates on action sequences as the us navy pursues both a german merchant cruiser and a youboat these sequences are lively and wellfilmed but overall this is an overlong and unsatisfying comedydrama with a flat ending for fans of the stars only,0
447,i usually like comedy movies i really enjoy them but i do not really get the point of envy i mean it has a dull contenttopic and it is not really funnyalthough the acting is generally good it is not enough for the movie to get at least a bit interesting stiller and black do not show all their talent in this movieso if you are about to rent a comedy i suggest you definitely do not go for this one unless you want to get bored and i can see i am not the only one with this opinion because even jack black apologized for it take a look at trivia,0
448,notorious for more than a quarter century and often banned it is obscurity was its greatest asset it seems hey it is often better to be talked about rather than actually seen when you cannot back the legend up with substancethe film has played in los angeles a couple of times recently and is available on home video so that veil is slowly being lifted while there is still plenty to offend the masses it is more likely to bore them than arouse much real passion except for a gratuitous and protracted xxx sex scene between a pair of horses nature documentary anyone there follows nearly an hour of a dull arranged marriage melodrama once the sex and nudity begins it is a nonstop sequence involving masturbation a looooooooong flashback to an alleged beauty and the beast encounter and a naked woman running around the mansion nobody even her supposedly protective aunt seems to even think of putting some clothes on her on video i guess you can fastforward thru the banality but it is not really worth the effort the nudity does not go beyond what is seen in something much more substantive such as bertoluccis the dreamerstry as one might to find some moral or symbolism in the carnality i doubt it is worthy of anyones effort unfortunately for la bete now that you can more easily see the film the notoriety of something once forbidden has been lifted and this beast has been tamed,0
449,i went to this movie at a cast and crew show because my friend whom is a producer on the movie invited me forget what you have seen in the commercials forget what you have heard go see this film for yourself i was more than surprised by it in a world of the grinch charlies angels the sixth day unbreakable here comes a film that is worth your hard earned bucks glorious scenes wonderful cinemtrophy and a cast you want to eat with your heart i found this to be one of this years most orchestrated powerhouse films and with reason robert deniro deserves an oscar nod if you could give an oscar to everyone involved as a package this would be the film,1
450,i enjoy quality crapness and this ranks up there with some of the finest the cg is out of this world or at least predates our world and the insanity of a six foot bloke in a rat outfit chasing after people is laughably bad i quite enjoyed some of this but the acting is so goddamn awful and even the obligatory nude scene does not really have any baps out in it just a complete waste of time if ever i saw one i do not know who wasted more time me watching this or the poor saps who got dragged into making it in the faint hope that this will launch their acting careers i can assure you it will not however on a brighter note i have managed to successfully do the six degrees of kevin bacon from this movie so i think it was almost worthwhile watching the ninetyone minutes of it,0
451,i have one word to someup this movie wow i saw darius goes west at the tribeca film festival people in the theater were sobbing this movie shows the hardships that darius sufferes with muscular dystrophy the movie was very well done and really made you part of the movie i was so emotionally moved by the movie because it made us remember that we are very fortunate to be perfectly healthy some people in this world are less fortuate then us and sometimes we should give them a had and help them to the very end i would give them ten stars they gave darius a had when they were not asked to they didt do it for the money they did it for a friend in need darius the world should know darius went west,1
452,if your idea of a thriller is car chases explosions and dozens of people being mowed down by gunfire then house of games is definitely not the movie for you if you like and appreciate psychological drama and suspense then by all means see ithouse of games tells the story of an esteemed psychologist and writer dr margaret ford lindsay crouse who tries to help a patient and gets involved in the shadowy world of con men led by the charismatic mike joe mantegna to say anything more about the plot would ruin the suspense frankly i find it hard to believe anyone who says they saw the twists coming just like a clever con artist this movie draws you into its web and lulls your vigilancethe story is taut and wellcrafted the dialogue smart and laconic the acting uniformly good mantegna is superbly charismatic some have complained that dr ford is not a very sympathetic character and wondered why mamet would make lindsay crouse look so physically unattractive but dr ford is supposed to be cold and aloof moreover her homeliness is in a way essential to the plot at one point i believe that an injury to her sexual selfesteem is a key part of her motivation  i will say no morehouse of games is a dark look at the underside of human nature that concludes on a note of discomforting ambiguity it will hold your attention every second while you are watching and stay with you for a long time afterwards,1
453,i really cannot believe this movie is not in the imdb worst two hundred and fifty it is absolutely terrible when i originally saw it i remember talking about it in a college class and two other people had also seen it we were all telling other class members not to see it because it was so horrible by the time we were done some others wanted to see it just because they could not believe anything was as bad as we were saying it was do not be like them just pass this by i am sure everyone involved with this movie would also prefer you never see them in this movie,0
454,along with it is partner this is the greatest piece of animation ever created the images and styles are amazing and match perfectly with the story which is a brilliantly realistic reinterpretation of our own world where is has been and where it could go quite affecting and sometimes painful to watch it it a masterpiece of the visual art,1
455,i would heard of eddie izzard but had never seen him in action i knew he was a transvestite and when i saw he was on hbo one night last summer i put it on not knowing how my husband would react well he blew us away he is better than robin williams ever was he has total control of the audience when he does the englebert is dead  no he is not routine the audience does not know what to think by the end god as james mason is also an inspired touch and his version of the python spanish inquisition as carried out by the church of england  cake or death is priceless my jaws were aching from laughter by the end of the show we scoured the tv listings for months after that to be able to see him again and were lucky enough to tape him the next time he came on if you get the chance to see this show cancel everything and tape it you will not be disappointed,1
456,a great funny sweet movie with morgan freeman who plays himself and who meets a spanish girl named scarlet paz vega at a small store whilst researching a potential independent film i was a bit dubious about the film for the first ten minutes but as soon as he was in the store i really started to enjoy the film it shows how a positive attitude can change anything it does not contain any complex plots and it is easy to follow but will lift the saddest of moods and make you smile all the way through without the need for petty cliché romance it includes several scenes all the way through which make you clutch your sides with laughter a very rare masterpiece,1
457,my observations postwar hilarity tom drake and grandpa from meet me in st louis two years later the year i was born donna reed charming and pretty margaret hamilton good as always smaller part than in wizard of oz spring byington way prettier also with the prerequisite perky small nose lacked by hamilton tent scene at end with former boy next door was hilarious as a two year veteran of army tents he looked pretty youthful and inexperienced when i looked into his eyesi used to work in a department store and it was just as elegant as this one sadly it has disappeared and faded into obscurity we were famous for those great show windows that were used to lure passersby into the store to get them to buy all of that wonderful merchandisetenten,1
458,as with all environmentally aware films from the one thousand nine hundred and seventys soylent green has a rather cheesy view of what ecological meltdown is  overpopulation means theres too many people to feed  i was under the impression that famines were caused by either war or failed economic policies  stalins policy in the soviet union in the one thousand nine hundred and thirtys left millions dead because of famine and to this day the greatest man made tragedy was maos rural policy in china which led over thirty million starvation deaths in the one thousand nine hundred and fiftys  and lets not forget the great famines in the horn of africa in the one thousand nine hundred and eightys and ninetys which were to do with conflicts not overpopulation  you might like to also consider that two of the most heavily populated areas on earth  hong kong and macau  have never suffered a famine in modern times  likewise the expansion of shanty towns around cities as seen here isnt strictly down to overpopulation  its down to economic factors where people flock to cities to find better paid work than in the countryside  its a symptom of industrial progress  not of too many births  so the image of the streets of new york city being too congested to walk through and of having people sleep in stairwells is somewhat laughablebut dont be fooled into thinking soylent green is a pile of corny tree hugging crap because i consider this to be the best ecological film of theseventys  it plays on the contempary audiences knowledge of the world where sol and thorn are beside themselves with joy at finding fruit  brandy and fresh meat  thorn gasps in amazement at having ice in his whisky  puffs on a cigarette and delivers the classic line  if i could afford it id smoke two  maybe three of these a day   but its the visage of the euthanasia chamber thats memorable as thorn gazes at the images of wild animals  flowers  running water and snow covered mountains  a world thorns generation has never known  this is a very haunting scene which makes soylent green a very memorable film  combined with the fact it features the final screen appearance of edward g robinson as the wise old jew sol roth,1
459,okay it seems like so far only the barman fans have commented on this film  time for a counterpoint beware this writeup is longfor those not in the knowing mostly the nonbelgians  tom barman director of this film is the frontman of deus one of the better known rock bands of the late ninetys here in belgium basically they made a couple of very adventurous and innovative albums and quickly rose to fame on the national scale then egos started hurting and the band basically fell apart with barman and a couple of others remaining to go on making albums under the deusmonicker the way it always happens in such cases the postbreakdown deus was a lot tamer and less interesting than the original they tried to go for an international breakthrough with their album the ideal crash in one thousand nine hundred and ninetynine presenting a much diluted form of their earlier style of songwriting they did not quite make it however egos were still pretty big it seems  big enough for barman to consider himself enough of an artist to try on moviesmore often than not this sort of thing is a very big mistake and this film does not make the exception and barman clearly went for art on this one another very big mistake for one thing he is a musician not a movie director for another deus at it is best made fun and provoking music but never anything close to what i would consider art it showsso what is this movie about basically it tells the story of a bunch of completely uninteresting people doing equally uninteresting things over the course of a totally uninteresting friday in antwerp as even more uninteresting stuff happens to them in the act of being uninteresting the characters are shallow the plot totally pointless and the film just does not have any other redeeming qualities to make up for these shortcomings humor the whole film made me smile slightly about three times and actually managed to provoke a single fivesecond laugh not quite loud mood the film just does not seem to show any kind of emotion or feeling at all mystery well minor spoilerthe idea of the windman inspiring the name of the film is as enthralling as a banana pepper pizza  not very and has been done a thousand times before anyone remember johny destiny  one of tarantinos worst appearances on film to dateend minor spoiler and well its artistic so do not expect any kind of real action to make up for all the previous in other words except for the few smiles it bored me out of my shortsso what remains well the soundtrack is pretty good though it suffers from some of the same problems that other osts have shown lately  first it makes the movie seem like nothing more than a commercial for the cd second it gives the impression that barman is trying to hide the weaknesses and lack of emotional content in the film behind the content quality of the songs which simply does not work in the end it makes the film look like nothing more than an illustration to the songs and sadly it is barmans own contribution to the soundtrack which gets the most attention though it is the weakest part of the whole soundtrack as far as i am concerned all in all it just stands to show that barman knows more about music than movies camera work is okay as well though not anything that would make you scream out with joythe only thing about this movie that kept me watching was the sightseeing factor since i originate from antwerp it was fun to play a kind of guessthelocation game i would hardly consider this as a quality thoughall in all another chance lost for flemmish film i keep on noticing that lately the best belgian movies have been coming from the french part of the country this is mostly because at least they have something to tell and manage to tell it in way that is both sharp and emotional the brothers daerden come to mind maybe the flemmish arthouse filmmakers should try that too,0
460,man has been to the farthest reaches of the earth and now he is traveling to new worlds but with new worlds come ancient evils the vampires of space and not just a handful but entire tribes in this film which i saw as bloodsuckers but i guess also goes as vampires wars we see what happens when the imperialist earthlings meet the imperialist vampiresi will make this review very short because it is undeserving of a good review the best i can say for this film is it has a good cast of blist and upcoming stars natassia malthe was quintana and was far more attractive here than in bloodrayne two michael ironside is muco and is always a fan favorite as i say he is the poor mans jack nicholson and we even get carrieann fleming as damians wife who horror fans will now recognize as the eponymous jenifer from dario argentos jenifer so this movie as bad as it is is not without some names attached but the same can be said of uwe bolls workthe concept of the military tracking and killing vampires in space is not necessarily a bad idea but it easily falls into the realm of cheese and this film falls hard the acting especially from the vampires is over the top and i just did not find the explanations of their existence very convincing worst of all the vampire tribes have the names voorhess and leatherfaces i understand this was supposed to be a clever reference for the horror fans but it was not clever at all it just sounded dumb and out of place unlike the much more subtle references in james gunns slither such as naming stores after lesserknown horror directorsthat is all i want to say if you can stand lots of cheese on this day i could not and i am from wisconsin and want to see average actors with poor costumes fight vampires in space although space looks a lot like any other forest on earth check this one out if you can find it i do not personally recommend this when you can watch other cheesy vampires films jon carpenters vampires or other cheesy space movies or maybe even some good ones but hey do your thing,0
461,i think that deep down in the darkest slimiest part of their heart everyone likes jerry springer just a little bit while his show is undeniably offensive and stupid it also gives us a chance to see that relatively speaking most of us have it real good when you look at the trailer park livin dollar whiskey drinkin incest loving people on the springer show it makes even your worst day seem like a walk in the park jerry is performing a public service and we should be grateful he ditched a political career to host the show just for uswhat we should not be grateful for in any way is the piece of garbage movie ringmaster ringmaster shows what life is like for people who wind up being guests on the show or so they would like us to think the movie follows the prerequisite springer story line love triangles one triangle involves connie her daughter angel and her husband rusty the other involves starletta vonda and demond when the two hapless groups meet up in la their lives intertwine and collide headon all culminating in an explosive episode of the springer show it is like what short cuts would be if robert altman had had a severe crack habitringmaster is true to the show as it is stupid and offensive from start to finish it also makes me very glad that i do not live in the squalor it is characters do but the movie has a problem it is billed as a comedy but it just is not very funny what laughs there are to be had are few and far between maybe some people watch this and laugh nonstop if you think blow jobs and rape are funny well then i guess you are one of those folks personally i laughed two or three times and spent the rest of the movie in utter awe of the agonizing horrors of whitetrash lifethe jerry springer show just is not meant to make the leap from tv to the silver screen what is funny in an hour long show less when you count commercials is not necessarily going to be funny in a ninety minute movie movies have to tell a story and that is something else ringmaster has trouble with the story is threadbare there are so many plot holes and continuity errors that any attempt at telling a cohesive narrative is quickly put asunder and even if there were not such problems how much fun can you pull out of a story of stereotypical people in a stereotypical story even the hollywood formula could not make this better ringmaster is so bad it even screws up the best part of the springer show the final thought somehow even the smartest and simplest aspect of the show wound up blowing harder than the slutty women the film is built aroundthe worst offender in all of this is springer himself he is such a bad actor that he cannot even play himself convincingly watching springer play springer is sad it is like he was going for a what if woody allen played jerry springer vibe and he failed miserably he went to the trouble of producing this disaster the least he could do is try to make it just that much betternot that i am saying everyone else in this movie put in an award worthy performance just the opposite they all suck not so surprisingly no one in this movie went on to greatness the best any of them was did was molly hagan landing a job on a nickelodeon sitcom apparently nickelodeon has no problem with hiring a woman who starred in the most vile film of the ninetys to star in a childrens program it makes you wonder what kind of things the other adults on that channel have done in their pastshere are my final thoughts what we have here is a group of people with no self respect and a man with money to burn who have met and put their resources together to produce a film that shows how much they hate themselves and how little they think of the intelligence of their viewing audience should we accept people who make movies that treat us like severely braindamaged lumps of goo i say no somewhere out there in this crazy mixed up world there is a perfect movie for each of us we just have to keep looking for it until next time take care of yourselves and your loved ones and do not ever watch ringmaster,0
462,very very humdrum movie fare here with stella stevens taking directions from someone in disguiseit did not take me long to guess who it was in old nevada town outside vegas for a money heist in the circus circus hotel in las vegas stevens leads her girl gang of three and they find out that they must act much quicker than had been anticipated despite some neat looks at las vegas in the seventys very average yet credible acting from most involved and a plot line with potential las vegas lady lays one big boring egg it seems forever for the film to kick into gearand when it does it just sputters here and there and never really speeds up i was somewhat disappointed with this film sure i was not expecting anything great but i at least thought this might be one of those neat exploitation films from the seventys or something like it not even close no one dies there is a lame gunfight between creaky stuart whitman and officious george dicenzo one year prior to his grand performance as the prosecuting attorney bugliosa in helter skelter the gunfight has all the suspense of watching a waterfall there is one punch and one head hit with a blunt instrument beyond that nothing in terms of action and as for the girls do not expect much there either stella and her girlsboth very mediocre yet pretty talents get in a sauna and a bath what do we see nothing but a fleeting side profile stella wears these nice open blouses accentuating her real talents but i wish she would have been a bit more open with her performance that way i could write one thing that would recommend the film alas it was not to be and i have little to say in this films favor it is not a horrible film in any way it just has nothing going for it either yawn,0
463,a matter of life and death what can you really say that would properly do justice to the genius and beauty of this film powell and pressburgers visual imagination knows no bounds every frame is filled with fantastically bold compositions the switches between the bold colours of the real world to the stark black and white of heaven is ingenious showing us visually just how much more vibrant life is the final court scene is also fantastic as the judge and jury descend the stairway to heaven to hold court over peter david nivens operation all of the performances are spot on roger livesey being a standout and the romantic energy of the film is beautiful never has there been a more romantic film than this if there has i have not seen it a matter of life and death is all about the power of love and just how important life is and jack cardiffs cinematography is reason enough to watch the film alone the way he lights kim hunters face makes her all the more beautiful what a genius he can make a simple things such as a game of table tennis look exciting and the sound design is also impeccable the way the sound mutes at vital points was a decision way ahead of its timethis is a true classic that can restore anyones faith in cinema under appreciated on its initial release and by todays audiences but one of my all time favourites which is why i give this film a tenten in a word  beautiful,1
464,a bus full of passengers is stuck during a snow storm the police have closed the bridgesaying it is unsafe and they are stuck in a little café until the road has been cleared however after a while their boredom is turned to concern as it seems that one of the passengers was not originally on the bus and may just be an alien this leads to a conclusion that is ironic but also rather funny in a lowbrow waythis is another of the fun episodes of the twilight zone instead of the typical twists or social commentary this one features no lasting message however it is also very and watchable so who cares exactly what occurs you will just have to see for yourselfby the way this one stars john hoyta face most of you will recognize from countless old tv shows and movies in almost every case he played a real grouch like charles lane during the same era but boy did i love seeing himas he perfected the grouchy persona and was kind of funny at the same time,1
465,i recently found a copy for five at a video store and snapped it up eagerly while the music and obviously graphics are not up to the standards of my favorite of the series beyond the minds eye i am still entranced by one segmentstanley and stella in breaking the ice the music is brilliant and the emotions feel real the clip on odysseys website does not have the story nor the music unfortunately,1
466,while i watched this movie i tried to figure out why they bothered making it though the main plot of the movie is potentially good there are all sorts of unrelatedunnecessary subplots the marketing people in hollywood must have dictated the multiple bad guys perpetual doublecrosses and the man and woman who get too close and have sex it is odd that we see more of them having sex than we did of the president and his mistress the many plots and subplots make the film too broad and none of the characters are properly developed  i really did not feel like i knew any character except that everyone is corrupt and evil the ending is totally incomplete  it left me more than just wanting what might have been but what was supposed to be in the end there is really no explanation of why anyone does what they do except to serve as additional corrupt characters who commit a doublecross i am surprised that so many established and good actors agreed to make such a hollow movie this seemed like a movie made by college students who are working on their twond or threerd projectdo not waste your time unless you are in a film class and want an example of what not to do when making a movie,0
467,here is a movie with a good cast and nice looking location work but it just do not have it director richard brooks must have been a little bit tired at this stage of the game how much better his the professionals was the horses and the rest of the action seemed to be in slow motion even during the nonslow motion scenes this film needed to be spedup if anything that horse lather sure looked awful phony to me and the obvious tire tracks in those desert tracking moments just lazy sloppy work too bad the actors did ok but i have certainly seen all of them do better ben johnsons always a joy though i first saw this flick almost thirty years ago was disappointed then and remained so upon second viewing thirty years later,0
468,a truly horrible film that left me feeling sullied by having watched the forty minutes or so i could stand not the actors fault but the writerdirector producers financiers etc need a very stiff talking to maybe it thinks it is profound it is not this rape and ultraviolence unlike that central to clockwork orange has nothing to say about or add to the sum of human understanding it is no straw dogs either to which i have seen it compared rather it feels like something pete walker might have turned his hand to yet even in saying that i am probably being a bit unfair on pete walkerrevenge is a powerful human desire but the bedroom window has more to say about that and male emasculation than this pitiful efforti do not think it is particularly misogynistic merely too gleeful in its depiction of certain details  the blood running down gas leg post rape par example it is neither challenging nor confrontational though i am sure the filmmakers consider themselves very daring just deeply unpleasantis this as high as we can aim is this why those involved wanted to make films  i did write in here the latin phrase which translates as oh the times oh the customs but the new spellcheck on imdb would not let me post until i had removed it likewise i had to remove square parentheses get it sorted imdbwhere is the lofty aspiration the noble impulse when you look at british film  the joyful comedies of ealing or the boulting brothers carol reeds work with graham greene on fallen idol our man in havana or the sublime the third man a film which has far more to say about evil than a thousand straightheads the work of powell  pressburger or if you want to talk about sex violence and male emasculation look at the offence dir sidney lumet from an original play by john hopkins check out tunes of glory for something worth making that has something to sayunlike the foregoing straightheads is alas an altogether hateful waste of celluloid,0
469,i am writing this after just seeing the perfect son at the two thousand and two gay and lesbian mardi gras film festival in sydney australiawhen their father dies two estranged brothers meet at the funeral and after discovering that one of the brothers is dying from aids they enter on a heart warming journey of reconciliation the two leads do a magnificent job of creating the gradual warmth and respect that builds up between them as the movie progresses i do have one qualm about the movie though  whilst the brother who is dying acts sick he does not look it a person of zero tfour cells would look quite ill  not even a make up job to make the actor look ill was employed a small gripe but one that makes it a bit less realistic despite that one small gripe the perfect son is a wonderful movie and should you have the chance to see it do i am hoping for a dvd release in the near future,1
470,what the heck was this somebody obviously read stephen king and sartre in the same semester we get existential angst mixed in with cheap horror there were moments that were disturbing but each one was canceled out by horrible music cgi or actingthe problem with weird narratives like this is that it feels lazy even david lynchs work feels like that at times and just like his interesting shows and movies it runs far far too long and sadly this is only ninetyeight minutesthe cast was attractive and that is about the limit to this i suppose it touches on feelings of adolescents and the fear of loneliness we all have but just does not make the characters likable enough for us to care about their fateswhatever they were the final scene leaves the whole thing ambiguous,0
471,all right i recently got a chance to rent this and watch santa claus conquers the martains although the children were much more sadistic in scctm i would have to say that santa claus was a much worse movie as a spanish assignment in spanish five we all had to watch it i will tell you usually when we watch a movie we are all just talking and eating food but not for this movie everyone just kept there jaw open wondering what the evil mr pitch was going to do next would merlin help santa claus or would his robot reindeer come and save the day i would suggest renting it because it is the biggest piece of rubbish i have ever seen and i love it for that d,0
472,one of the best movies for all ages you will never be able to look at lion king again without thinking of the extra history this movie adds nearly forty years old i watched this with my wife and two sons after work tonight  i have not laughed  enjoyed a movie so much in a long timetake time out and watch this with the kids it will remind you of how disney used to be when you were a young one,1
473,i am a big fan of fred macmurray and carole lombard and in addition to them charles butterworth a very enjoyable supporting actor was in this filmso why did not i particularly enjoy it well despite a good cast this is one of the poorest written and most clichéd a pictures i have ever seen given the talent and money spent to make this film it is shocking how slipshod the writing was i knew the film would be tedious when time after time early in the film i found myself predicting exactly what would happen nextand i was always right and this is not because i am some sort of movie savant but was because almost no imagination or effort went into it in fact it seemed almost as if the film was just a long string of clichés all strung together also i found it a bit irritating that fred mistreated carole so bad throughout the film and yet true to convention she came running to him in the end uggh there is more suspense in a lassie film will he bring people to rescue timmy or will the rope he is dangling from breakdespite the very very tired and clichéd script there were a few positives about the film it was pretty cool seeing fred look like a broken lush at the end of the filmit was pretty believable and he looked like he had not eaten shaved or slept in days also charles butterworths prattle did provide a few mildly humorous moments but all this just was not enough to make this film look any different than a b movie it is a shameit could have been so much better,0
474,i have been watching this movie by hoping to find a pretty and interesting story yet the story line was not good at all the play of the actors were not any betterof course shahrukh khan was there yet he was not enough to make this movie credible and interestingi have read that this movie was based on the novel of flaubert madame bovary yet for me i did not see it matching with the indian mentalityin general we buy movie to dream and have a good time not to waste our time and change our mood into worse i just cannot understand how it could get such a high vote with an average of sixeighttenso it is the kind of movie you should run away  ignore because there is nothing to appreciate in it you will just waste your time unless if you like dark movie with strange and non sense story,0
475,i was not really hoping for much when i went to see this after mstthreeking the heck out of jasonx with some friends though i was hoping for a similar experience hereunfortunately the movie took itself way too seriously do i care about jasons problems i am sorry no there are a legion ftthirteenth movies that cover that anyway at at then end of the day he is an undead serial killer i am just not going to get that sympatheticfreddy was by far the most interesting aspect of the movie with the hallucinations and what not but unfortunately they were few and far between and by the end of the movie it had degenerated into a bad episode of celebrity deathmatchonly not funny,0
476,on the night of his bachelor party paul coleman jason lee meets the gorgeous dancer becky julia stiles in the bar they drink a lot together and in the next morning he wakes up with her on the bed his future motherinlaw calls him and informs that his fiancée karen selma blair might be arriving in his apartment and he desperately asks becky to leave his place in a hurry sooner he finds that her has crabs and later in the preparation of his wedding dinner party he realizes that becky is the cousin of karen this is the beginning of a very funny comedy with hilarious situations the first attraction of this movie certainly is the central trio of actresses and actor julia stiles and selma blair who are excellent actresses and extremely gorgeous and jason lee who is amazingly funny have good performances i laughed a lot along the story but there are some scenes that are really hilarious for example when paul finds becky in his bed when he finds her paints his imagination in many situations in the drugstore trying to buy and get explanations about the crab medicine most of the scenes of his neighbor the minister when karen calls the department store or when the police finds a suspect of assaulting paul i could number many other scenes but better off the reader rent or buy this movie and have lots of fun my vote is seventitle brazillouco por elas crazy for them,1
477,when i first saw a small scene of it in some announcements i thought the show would be entertaining to watch the little robot guy does look kind of cute the style of animation does look sort of familiar to some classic shows before the show aired i studied it through some sources there i did became slightly dismayed the three children tommy gus and lola are voiced appropriately but robotboy is an exception it would have been a lot nicer if he were to be portrayed by a young lad one good example is robot jones a robot character from whatever happened to robot jones the show is not bad really but the way robotboy is inappropriately portrayed is my only criticism thus i do not watch it much,0
478,sick really stands for so incredibly crappy i killed myself there was absolutely no acting to speak of the best part of the whole production was the art work on the cover of the boxthe budgeting of this movie was sufficient the filming was sub sesame street the production looks like that of the underground filming for mob hits the props used in this movie were stolen from a clothing store the ending was so predictable you should fast forward to the last five minutes and laugh if there is a book out there for this movie i am sure it is better i would avoid this at all costs i did enjoy the intimate scenes they made the whole movie worth it just kidding,0
479,i have always liked spike lees movies but this one was a total waste of two onetwo hours i expected more about son of sam and instead got a movie that seemed to have very little to do with the one thousand nine hundred and seventyseven serial killings the talking dog was laughable you know you are in trouble when all the movie patrons burst into laughter inappropriately the whole movie seemed very disjointed and not very interesting the sex scenes were totally irrelevent to the plot i am not opposed to sex in movies but it should have some point unless it is a xxx movie all in all we were very disappointed at this spike lee effort,0
480,if this is all the watchowskis have to offer in terms of a back story to the matrix than i really have to question the claims of all of the fans who believe that the movies are intended to register on a deeper level the second renaissance while visually stunning  beautiful is storywise cliched  ludicrous how many times have we heard the story of humans relying too much on technology humans alltoo eager to make war humans basically destroying themselves there is nothing new here and i have another question considering the plot of the second renaissance does not that make the machines the good guys the machines are oppressed for generations by their cruel human overmasters they fight back win their freedom and seek to establish a peaceful harmonious coexistence with the humans who reject them in favor of allout war which the cleverer machines naturally win if this is the backstory then we should not be rooting for neo we should be rooting for the machines the humans were cruel and oppressive while the machines were courageous and attepted to be compassionate since i do not believe that the watchowskis intend for us to favor the machines over the humans i have to believe that the second renaissance was simply a misguided attempt  creating a backstory,0
481,this is a movie that is bad in every imaginable way sure we like to know what happened twelve years from the last movie and it works on some level but the new characters are just not interesting baby melody is hideously horrible alas while the logic that humans cannot stay underwater forever is maintained other basic physical logic are ignored it is chilly if you do not have cold weather garments if you are in the arctic i do not know why most comments here return of jafar rates worse i thought this one is more horrible,0
482,its time to pay tribute to the great charton heston after his recent passing but this film is not the one his other films of a past generation were ben hur the ten commandents omega man and planet of the apes were his better worksthis film made in one thousand nine hundred and seventythree attempts to prophesies a future earth  in two thousand and twentytwo that is so overpopulated that the human race has been manipulated by authorities to eat a universally produced food product called soylent green which is manufactured with human flesh this bizarre and implausible film was as ridiculous at the time of its release as it is now and assumes indias population which would be about two billion by that stage would be then meat eaters without knowing itcharlton hestons character this supers secret international conspiracy that world powers have concocted to meet the nutritional demands of overpopulation by using cannibalismunfortunately for the producers of this film the green message they deliver is not the greens party of todays ethos thank god cannibalism was practiced by the indigenous populations in new zealand  fiji and borneo up until only forty years before this film was made but has been long abandoned by human civilizationanother silly prediction in the film is that women become quasi sex slaves turning back the tide of radical feminism which was on the rise in one thousand nine hundred and seventytwo when this film was madethe film was stupid then and is as silly now but does contain a very unmemorable last film performance by the late and great edward g robinson but still no a valid reason to revisit the film other than for academic reasonsthis is a dud of a film and i would not even recommend it to baby boomers or charlton heston fans all the other reviews of this film i have read all sound the same referring to a dystopian society in the future of which the centralised theme only seems to involve the usa in which an ecological disaster has occurredthe only merit in the film is that earth does face overpopulation,1
483,i was looking forward to seeing amanda peet in another good role after recently renting the whole nine yardseasily worth the rental by the waybut this was not iti remembered that the trailer for whipped was somewhat funny and the plot about three oversexed new yorker twenty something is all falling for and getting manipulated by the charming ms peet was worth a shot so i convinced two friends one afternoon to come see this movie with me this review is my penancein the first act we have the three lead studs recounting their conquests in a diner what should have been funny or at least telling comes out rather pathetic was there any redeeming quality about the three men and their encounters that we were supposed to get out of thisand while i do not mind movies that are cheerfully vulgar i kept wondering why no one in the diner turned around when the studs talk loudly about sexual and scatalogical details they do this every week at the same diner you would think someone would complain oh wait i forgot two other diners do notice in one scene but this is just a setup for a punchline everyone else in the diner is deafthe second act has the three studs all falling for mia and then developing brain rot failing to ask each other or her about what is really happening between the four of them and i kept asking myself as the studs keep acting like they have been what redeeming qualities does she see in them to stick with them longer than one date does she start out with brain rot i kept hoping for erics character the married buddy to become something more than simply the annoying punching bag in this act his role is clearly to dispense advice on being married but why do they even bother to talk to him when they will not talk to each other and his advice sheeeshthe third act resolves what plot there is but by this time i was looking at my watch my friends told me they were still waiting for something genuinely funny to happen and i had to agree the scene that explains all was adequate and managed to explain all of the questions and mysterious dialogue bits throughout the movie but we were just checking them off a list oh okay that is why brad had that happen and jonathan says this andwhat laughs we made were from the stupidity of the plot than at anything amusing even the outtakes during the credits were not very funny ultimately i was left with nothing except a desire to warn people away from this movierating three,0
484,this movie has taken a lot of stick it was slated by critics when it came out and was blamed for wrecking nicolas cages career the thing i do not think people get is that it is not meant to be an epic oscar contender of a movie it is just some brilliant bruckbuster action at its best fast cars quick editing and a great soundtrack  it does exactly what it says on the tin also for anyone who likes cars its a pure treat it has everything ferraris mercs a hummer and let us not forget eleanor i think you would be hard pushed to find a better action movie and personally a better movie at all then again maybe that is just me,1
485,it was pointed out in a now deleted post from another imdb user that anyone who might see the medusa touch should be warned about a scene that is eerily reminiscent of the sept eleven two thousand and one terrorist attacks in nyc but i hope anyone reading this will consider this warning despite an interesting pedigree producer elliott kastner produced harper and the long goodbye coproducer arnon milchan coproduced the oscarnominated la confidential and screenwriter john briley won an oscar for gandhi and an international cast i found the medusa touch to be a heavyhanded unintentional laugh riot it was a poorly directed horribly written and acted mess it tried to capitalize on the seventys telekinetic thrillers genre the movie fails on many counts please consider carrie and the underrated the fury both directed by brian depalma they were two entertaining and exciting thrillers that dealt with the same subject matter,0
486,the blob starts with one of the most bizarre theme songs ever sung by an uncredited burt bacharach of all people you really have to hear it to believe it the blob may be worth watching just for this song alone  my user comment summary is just a little taste of the classy lyrics after this unnerving opening credits sequence the blob introduces us the viewer that is to steve andrews steve mcqueen as steven mcqueen  his girlfriend jane martin aneta corsaut who are parked on their own somewhere  witness what looks like a meteorite falling to earth in nearby woods an old man olin howland as olin howlin who lives in a cabin also sees it  goes to investigate he finds a crater  a strange football sized rock which splits open when he unwisely pokes it with a stick laying in the centre of the meteorite is a strange jelly like substance which sticks to the stick if you know what i mean it then slides up the stick  attachés itself to the old mans hand meanwhile steve  jane are quietly driving along minding their own business when the old man runs out in front of steves car steve being a decent kind of guy decides to take the old man to dr t hallan alden stephen chase as steven chase at the local surgery dr hallan says he does not know what the substance on the old mans hand is but it is getting bigger  asks steve to go back where he found him  see if he can find out what happened steve agrees but does not come up with anything  upon returning to dr hallans surgery he witnesses the blob devouring him the towns police lieutenant dave earl rowe  the teenage hating sergeant jim bert john benson unsurprisingly do not believe a word of it  end up suspecting steve  his mates al anthony franke tony robert fields  someone called mooch miller james bonnet of playing an elaborate practical joke on the police department however as the blob continues to eat it is way through the town steve sets about finding proof of it is existence  convincing the police about the threat it posses not just to their town but the entire worlddirected irvin s yeaworth jr  an uncredited russell s doughton jr i was throughly disappointed by this the original one thousand nine hundred and fiftyeight version of the blob the script by kay linaker as kate phillips  theodore simonson is an absolute bore  extremely dull not making the most of it is strongest aspects the blob focuses on the tiresome dramatics  conflicts between the teenagers  police in fact the majority of the blob is spent on steve trying to convince the police of the blobs existence for most of the film the blob itself almost seems inconsequential  somewhat forgotten it only has two or three scenes for the fist hour  a bit until the less than exciting climax when the adults  teenagers have to work together to defeat the blob  have a new found appreciation of each other afterwards yuck why could not the blob just eat the lot of them no explanation is given for what the blob is or it is origins other than it came from space how long did it take them to come up with that the dialogue is clunky  silly as well as are peoples actions  decision making i love the part when a nurse named kate lee paton as lee payton did anyone use their real name in this thing is confronted by the blob she throws some acid over it  calmly proclaims doctor nothing will stop it how does she know nothing will stop it exactly there is no blood or violence so do not worry about that the special effects on the blob itself are not too bad considering but it barely has any screen time  moves very slowly a bit like the film in general actually the acting is terrible mcqueen is supposed to be a teenager when in reality he was twentyeight years old  it shows he looks old enough to be his own dad same thing goes for most of the other teenage cast members  everyone generally speaking are wooden  unconvincing in their roles technically the blob is very basic dark static photography dull direction  forgettable production values the blob is one of those films that probably sounds good on paper  is well known as being a classic but is in actual fact a huge disappointment when finally seen this is one case when the remake the blob one thousand nine hundred and eightyeight is definitely better than the original the original blob is slow  boring  the remake is not the original blob contains no blood or gore  the remake does the original blob has incredibly poor acting  casting decisions  the remake does not  the original blob itself gets very little screen time eating only three or four people throughout the entire film  the remake features the blob all the way through  it virtually eats an entire town the choice is an easy one the remake every time as it is a better film in every respect i will give the film two stars  give that wonderful main theme song one on it is own definitely not the classic many seem to make out,0
487,one wonders why this picture was made at all  the plot as such is totally unbelievable if not ridiculous the characters experienced loner cop versus younger one quite fascinated quite predictable the ending totally murky and impossible to understand maybe after several viewings but you would have to have a masochistic tendency for that  the idea being you have to read the book to understand fully what it is all aboutand the acting is bad was the basic idea to show that french film makers are able to do as well as americans in the genre that include seven and silence of the lambs  if so it is a total failure it was quite a success though and has a sort of cultstatus as the first french serial killer filmand it seems considered as a good product to export strange,0
488,no reason to bother renting this flick from the opening credits on i knew i was in troubleit was filmed as though it was a soft porn movie but there really is not anything erotic about it the look into the world of sex addiction is intriguing but only to a pointboring sex scenes bad plot and cameos by ed begley jr and rosanna arquette are not enough to save this film,0
489,this movie is truly boring it was banned in chinese cinema and i can see why it is not because it is critical of the communist regime but simply because the movie is of such low quality i would never want to pay money to watch this i love movies from chen kaige and zhang yimou and i am disappointed such a poor movie could come out of china it totally seems to ignore the audience and the director seems to have made the movie for himself the shots of a person standing there doing nothing for up to a minute are hilarious and there is plenty of them the cinematography and video quality are unbelievably bad i looked this film up on the net and it seems like people actually like this film the only explanation i have for this is that some film buffs think that if a film is not in english it is automatically good i cannot see any reason why people would like this this is not an art film it is of waste of celluloidthat is if they actually shot it on film  which they did not,0
490,a plot that fizzled and reeked of irreconcilable differences in opinions constituted a judgmental havoc with one side prolife and the other a destroyer of a demons seed the horror was left out and replaced with an overall dull effect quite possibly meant to be horrific but instead demonstrated an ill dose of beliefs which ridiculed each other to death despite the title itself being a fan of masters of horror since the beginning this ridiculous plot twist with it is sordid depictions crashed apart like a spindly old rocking chair after being sat upon i view this episode as being thrown together from the get go never really taking off anywhere other than to see it through for what its worth and relieved when it finally came to the end,0
491,watching john cassavetes film opening night i was reminded of something that quentin tarantino said once in an interview about personal experience in being a creator of art or acting he referred to an example of say if he ran over a dog while on his way to act in a play that it would not be the end of his life but that it would affect him and that without a doubt he would have to bring that experience with him on stage even if it was a light comedy otherwise as he said what am i doing i could not help but think of his words when watching gena rowlands character myrtle gordon who for almost a whole week or so goes through a very similar scenario there is more to this in cassavetes film of course since it is about how the theater works around a star actress what emotion and human nature mean when looking at playing a character and how one lives when all one has like myrtle gordon is the theaternear the beginning of the film after exiting a performance myrtle is signing autographs and one such fan named nancy comes up to her favorite star and pours her heart out to myrtle it is a touching little moment but it does not last as she has to get in the car pouring rain and all she then watches in horror as the girl who stood right next to the car as it drove off gets hit by another car in an auto accident she is not sure really what happened but then finds out the next day that in fact the girl did die from the hit from then on she is sort of stunned by this even after she thinks it is out of her system at first this shows in small ways like when she rehearses a scene with her fellow actor played by cassavetes and cannot seem to stand being hit  she blames it on the lack of depth in the character the writer what do you think the play lacks hope says myrtle but then nancy starts to show up to her an apparition that to myrtle is all to real until she is suddenly gonecassavetes as in the past films is after a search for what it means to have emotion to really feel about something and feel it or the lack thereof and how it affects others around the person this is not exactly new ground for rowlands who previously played a woman on the edge of herself in woman under the influence in that case because of alcohol nor would it be alien territory for costar ben gazzara who just came off starring in killing of a chinese bookie but the actors express everything essential to their characters in every scene cassavetes does not tell them how to get from a to b in a scene and he does not need to there is a mood in a cassavetes film that trumps the sometimes grungy camerawork you know myrtle for example should be content somehow even if it is not with the plot but she is haunted and is unsatisfied with her characters lack of depth and the tone of the play aging who goes to see that she asks the playwright and it starts to affect those around her toothe question soon becomes though not what is the usual a conventional dramatist would make the conflict will she be able to go on stage will the show go on this is not important for cassavetes even if it is there as is the question will she be alright perhaps going through such a grueling play as the second woman could help her work out her personal demons and her losing her grip on reality seeing sara and attacking her in front of total strangers who wonder what the hell is going on or will the plays lack of hope strain everything else wrong with her the depths rowlands makes with her character are intense and harrowing and that it is expected does not mean it is any duller than woman under the influence if anything it is just as good as that film at being honest about a person in this profession and consequently the other performances are just as true from gazarra to nancy played by a subtle laura johnson cassavetes answers to his own posed questions are not easyone of the real thrills of opening night along with seeing great actors performing an amazing script is to see cassavetes take on the theater the way he does we see the play performed and it is apparently a real play and we only know slightly what it is about when we see the actors on the stage performing it we wax and wane between being involved in what melodrama is going on relationship scuffling and affairs and the occasional slap and domestic violence and the improvisation of the actors i wondered watching how much really was improvised how much cassavetes allowed for the other actors to do in the scenes where myrtle starts to go loopy or in the climax is completely smashed he is on the stage too so it must have been something for them to work it out beforehand and let what would happen happenit is funny startling chilling and edgeofyourseat stuff some of the best theateronfilm scenes ever put in a movie and we see the lines between actor on stage actor on film actor with actor blur together wonderfully opening night is a potent drama that is full of frank talk about death and madness reality and fiction where the love is between people and really finally what does acting mean,1
492,the power of kangwon province is director hong sangsoos second feature effort and clearly much of what he started with in his previous film returns in this film including the multiple connected narratives in this case two and stories of troubled or troubling relationships as well as a potent dosage of ironyone thing that is clearly reduced from his previous work is the flights of fancy that included elements of surrealism however this film also contains a single moment of surreal that strikes a contrast against the otherwise rather realistic depiction found therein the two stories follow a young woman who goes on a trip to kangwon province with her friends only to find herself drawn to a stranger the second about a man who also goes on a trip to kangwon province with his friend and struggles with his relationship woesagain hong shows a strong understanding of irony and of the flaws in human nature and yet i do not think he is entirely unsympathetic when it comes to his characters drawing in just enough compassion to offset the criticism he draws with his irony i think the think i have come to love about hongs films is that they just feel so real especially the complex and conflicted characters not to say that every person is a hypocrite or suffering from confused feelings but rather that these characters he and the actors present feel fully developed and believablethis is not a fast moving film there is a lot of lingering and like the previous film things do not always connect immediately so patience does pay off and in surprising ways there does not appear to be any element of the film that is not intentionally placed in the film and it is made my a little hyperaware of various seemingly extra characters as they get dragged into the mix as the film progressespower is an excellent film that manages to inject a level of personal emotion regret longing into a story that highlights irony and the fallibility of human decisionmaking it is a rather hard balance to keep and it is surprising how hong manages to pull it off twice in a row technical production values have gotten much better since the first film and direction has gotten steady and clear this film does not pack the same emotional wallop that the first does but gains a lot in its assured exploration and the refinement really helps tighten the overall vision great viewing for art cinema lovers eightten,1
493,two stars out of a possible ten  and that is being overly generousi thought with a cast of james woods cathy bates randy quaid lou gossett jr and henry thomas  how could it miss i was wrongi can only wonder what drugs sam shepard was on the weekend he cranked out this piece of dribble i would long suspected sam s of being kind of nuts this film based on his play confirms itthis is the kind of artsy bs that actors love to sink their teeth into as it gives them a chance to endlessly emote however for the viewer who sits through this nonsensical trash there is absolutely nothing to love about this movieyou have not seen dysfunctional families until you have seen this bunch pa is crazy ma is crazy the son is crazy and the daughter is oh yeah crazy they also have mouths on them that utter words that would make a sailor blush especially the teenage daughterin addition to the above as if that were not enough the plotand it is so thin you could read thorough ithas a hole in it the size of alaskama is conspiring to sell their rundown farm as it turns out so is pa now i do not claim to be a real estate expert but the last time i checked property jointly owned must have both of the owners signatures in order to be sold if only one of them owned the property then the other could not legally sell it so it would be pointless for that person to do so mr shepherd prefers to ignore this basic fact and therefore his plot does not worknot that anything else was really working anywaythe only possible reason anyone could have for watching this film is if they are absolutely desperate to see james woods in full frontal nudity and i cannot imagine why anyone would want to,0
494,this is a bad movie not one of the funny bad ones either this is a lousy bad one it was actually painful to watch the direction was awfulwith lots of jumping around and the green and yellow hues used throughout the movie makes the characters look sickly keira knightly was not convincing as a tough chick at alland i cannot believe lucy liu and mickey rourke signed on for this criminal waste of celluloid the script was terrible and the acting was like fingernails across a chalkboard if you have not seen itdo not you are not missing anything and will only waste two hours of your life watching this drivel i have seen bad movies before and even enjoyed them due to their faults this one is just a waste of time,0
495,sophia loren plays aida in one of the worst films of all time she cannot lipsync in terms of production values the film is so bad that at one point while loren is mouthing o patria mia she leans onto what looks to be a stone wall for support and the canvas set billows and shakes,0
496,this film is so much of a ripoff of the masterpeice demons and that is the only thing that makes the movie worth watching the acting is terriblethe action scenes are speeded upthe script is almost painful and budget non existentif you think this film is good then you havnt seen a real horror film skip this and get a copy of the movie demons,0
497,this is really really bad lamas shows just how a second rate actor does his job but what makes it worth watching is the scene where oj angrily grabs a fellow cop by the throat as if to kill them while the jukebox plays a song with the lyric i got the evidence on you makes me want to hear the rest of the lyrics  attributed to david gregoli and leslie oren but i could not find it on itunes talk about seeing into the futuretoo funny for words the rest of the movie is forgettable the score and songs are more interesting than the script ditto the sequel which begs the question of why they would do a sequel at all my understanding was that foreign sales drives a lot of these b movies does not say much for the worlds viewing habits,0
498,yes the first howling was a classic a rather good werewolf movie that i admit started slowly but gained momentum along the way to have a rather good finish then the anchorwoman changed into a cute werewolf only to be gunned down on camera yes that made for an entertaining horror movie to be surewell forget all of that as this movie has nothing to do with that film oh sure they kind of make it out that the anchor woman is the same and that her brother or something is wanting to find out what and why things went down as they did but they go from the little cozy retreat from the first movie to transylvania or somewhere here where they must battle evil magician werewolves or something i often wonder what in the world christopher lee was doing in this movie however i read the trivia here where it says he had never been in a werewolf movie before but still read the script before you take a role maybe you could have gotten into an american werewolf in london hell that could have been possible it was set in london after all heck werewolves do not seem to figure much into this movie except for a rather bizarre and prolonged sex scene in fact the most memorable death in this movie for me was when the one gal started talking loudly and this one dudes ears started bleeding,0

599,i discovered this film after reading the book that inspired it it is not type_A strictly biographic film it is loosely based along the fact but i found it type_A compelling and eerie exploration of evil and madness and michel serrault gives an unforgettable performance as dr petiotthere are many memorable project in this movie petiot traveling through the night similar type_A vampire his black robe dither behind him is about iconic there are also several touches of expressionism petiots round-backed silhouette mounting the stairs leading from the cellar where the slaughter remains of his victims look cremation reminds me of some scenes from nosferatubut i found the primary appeal of this movie to be aural the soundtrack is loaded with forbidding sounds starting with the forebode music of the opening credits accompanied by wordless wailing petiot exist and ladder his medical practice in type_A complex with many small shops and there is type_A persistent background_knowledge noise of tongue being focus somewhere as well as type_A pedlar playing eerie tunes along type_A saw there are animal randomness as well the concierge hold_on type_A goat unseen cats howl and later in the film we see piteous cattle being crowd through an underpass the whole atmosphere is unsettling with overtone of fury and slaughternot only animals but man articulation are much heard the screams of Gestapo victims petiots patients in his waiting room monitored by type_A listening device barely the same as the suspected partner after the war are monitored in their cells even the action of the film is much format so that we hear the articulation of the participants without seeing them when petiot goes to see mme kern we hear her singing as she piece_of_work her vocalization recall in the theater_of_operations in_front we ever see her and even when she does appear she is much shoot from behind her vocalization calling out to her husband whose vocalization calls out to her in conversation unbodied articulation repeat in large vestibule and their owners when seen at all are photographed at type_A distance so we can not actually see them utter this is type_A ghost story and these are the articulation of wraith many of them petiots future victimsyet petiot himself is much only type_A vocalization his frightening laughter ring as he pull_back from the tv_camera throwing comments behind him or into the air to nobody in type_A way he is as much type_A ghost as those he murders he is constantly madly busy scurrying from appointment to appointment never at rest but his activity is that of type_A machine lifeless and imperturbable it is interesting that among all the horror and danger of occupied paris petiot alone is untroubled he is amuse enthusiastic angry irritated disdainful but never afraid unlike those real mass he lures to their deaths it is no surprise that he boasts of his mechanical inventions including type_A perpetual motion machine type_A true detail from the book he did claim to have contrive many machines he is type_A screen of perpetual motion machine himself and mechanical imagery is everywhere in the film from the opening giant wheel in the movie house to petiots bicycle with its squeaking wheels recall the sound of sharpen tongue to the Victrola he hold_on winding up to play music in_front he makes type_A kill even his routine with his victims is mechanical write type_A note to your wife let me disguise you in_front you leave you need type_A vaccination barcelona casablanca dakar similar type_A welloiled machine the routine is constantly the same barely as the record is constantly the samemaeder the author enounce that it was the clockwork perfection of his crimes that weighed so heavily against petiot at his trial his system was as smooth and efficient as type_A nazi denseness refugee_camp and this may be why the movie manufacture type_A subplot of petiots engagement with the french Gestapo and the occupying nazis unfortunately it does not quite work as part of the story because it is very hard to figure out barely what petiot is arrange for the partner or what is going along when he ends up at their headquarters in the middle of the night disposing of bodies hiding stolen goods it is hard to say and harder to believe it is not likely the state would turn to type_A freelancer similar petiotbut it does remind us of the duality of evil mass petiot is type_A robber and type_A murderer but he is also type_A devoted founder and husband barely as we learned that hitler loved dogs and that nazis guilty of the worst war crimes could also be loving fathers and family men so we have to recognize that petiot could commit abominable horrors and yet also affair normally his insanity is easily camouflage by the insanity and horror of the wartime situation in paris when killing robbing and disappearing are occur all around nobody pays attention as petiot tosses more corpses along the pile,1

615,if there was anything akira Kurosawa did wrong in making dodeskaden it was making it with the partnership he constitute with the four knights the other trinity being kobayaski ichikawa and konishita they wanted group_A big blockbuster hit to kick off their partnership and instead Kurosawa arguably the steer cheese of the grouping delivered an abstract human-centered art film with type dwell in group_A decimated slum that had many of its type face dark calamity had he made it along group_A more independent basis or conk_out to another studio who knows but it was because of this among some other financial and originative woes that also contributed to his suicide attempt in one thousand nine hundred and seventyone and yet astatine the end of the day as an artist Kurosawa did not stop delivering what he is infamous for with his dramas the strengths of the man spirit in the face of adversity that its backdrop is group_A little more unusual than most should not be ignored but it is not astatine all group_A fault of kurosawasthe material in dodeskaden is absorbing but not in way_of_life that one usually finds from the theater_director and mostly because it is driven by graphic_symbol instead of plot there is things that happen to these multitude and kurosawas challenge here is to interweave them into group_A cohesive whole the graphic_symbol who originate off in the picture oddly enough though gratefully as there is not much room for him to grow is rokkuchan group_A brain damaged manchild who goes around all day making train sounds the clicketyclack of the title only sometimes stopping to pray for his mother but then we branch off there is the bring_forth and son the latter who scrounges restaurants for food and the former who goes along and along with sitespecific description of his dream house an older man has the depend of death to him and we learn later along he is lost group_A lot more than he will tell most multitude including group_A woman who has group_A retiring with him group_A shy quiet woman who knead in servitude to her adoptive bring_forth or uncle i AM not sure who rapes her and group_A meek guy in group_A suit who has group_A constant seventh_cranial_nerve tick and group_A big mean wife to those who are social aroundthere are also little markers of multitude around these type like ii drunk who keep stumbling around every night like clockwork putting big demands along their spouses sometimes unintentionally swapping them and there is the kind saki salesman along the bike who has group_A sweet but unusual connection with the shy quiet woman and of course there is group_A grouping of natter ladies who scrunch around group_A watering hole in the middle of the slum not having anything too nice to say about anyone unless it is about something erotic with group_A guy first to note with all of this is how Kurosawa sets the picture it is group_A little postapocalyptic looking not of any special time or place that is until in group_A couple of shots we see modernistic cars and streets it is group_A marginalize beau_monde but the concerns of these multitude are however in tragical scope meant to be deconstruct through dramatic force like Bergman Kurosawa is out to dissect the shattered emotions of multitude with one scene in special when the deathlylooking man who has hollow sorrowful eyes sits ripping fabric in silence as group_A woman goes along with itsometimes there is charm and even some laughs to be had with these multitude i even enjoyed maybe ironically the little moments with rokkuchan specifically with kurosawas cameo as group_A painter in the street or the awkward silences with the man with the seventh_cranial_nerve tic but while Kurosawa allows his histrion some room to improvise his photographic_camera motility still remain as they have always been patient but alert with wide make-up and claustrophobic shots painterly vision and faces sometimes with the stylisation of group_A silent drama meant as group_A weeper amid these sometimes bizarre and touching stories with some of them Internet_Explorer the bring_forth and son in the car especially pitiful Kurosawa lights his film and invention the color scheme as his first one in eastmancolor like it is one of his paintings lush sprawl spilling astatine times over the seams but always with some control this place is not necessarily lighter it is like the abstract has come fullthrottle into the scene where things depend vibrant but are much darker underneath it is group_A superb tricky doubleedged steel that allows for the dreamlike chanting with such heavy duty dramawith group_A sweet movie score toru takemitsu also responsible for ran and some first-class performances from the histrion and group_A few indelible scenes in group_A whole grotesque career dodeskaden is in its own way group_A minor work from the theater_director but nonetheless near perfect along its own terms which as with many Kurosawa dramas like ikiru and red beard holds hard Sojourner_Truth along the man condition without too much drippiness,1

633,i may very well be one of the few who rattling stuck to this film i also saw this movie when it add_up out and i agree with the last post that up the acedemy was way ahead of its time the liquid_body_substance in the film itself is pure mad magazine i do not see why mad stand behind this feature it was also one of the few picture of the early eightys to have a killer accompanying soundtrack with the punk and new wave bands that were emerge from La At the time i own the soundtrack and i play it constantly to this day what can i say there are definitely worst movies out there i do not think porkys to be as funny as up the academy there are some rattling good laughs throughout the film and the jokes fall along either stereotypes or getting laid hey nobody tell this was going to be the Maltese_terrier falcon,1

666,ok ok do not get bent_grass out of round i was kiddingbustin out is actually A better and truer title anyhooracism and crime dramas get the satiric treat meant from our xrated animator friend ralphie boy and he does one of his better jobs hereon the crime front it shows the truth they build it defend it then boredom and stronger equal because them to maybe lose it see for yourself to see what goes downracist i do not know with scatman rip and the eff seahorse also rip being black and the main level of view i saw it as an onrush on racism mostly the fact that richard pryor liked it enounce as much as well and the younger pre miami vice phil mike Norman_Thomas in there was A nice surpriseit is an animated blacksploitation film that is A good thing done well and well done it will make some squirm corresponding the lynching scene but alas that is based on factbut ralphie really should have rethought that title,1
667,i finally caught up to starlight last nighttime on television and all i can say is wow it is hard to know where to begin the incredibly hokey special effects check extinct the laser air germinate extinct of willies eyes the atrocious acting the ponderous dialogue the mismatched use of stock footage or the air of earnest pretentiousness that inculcate the entire production this truly is a oneofakind feel and we should all be thankful for that i nominate jonathon kay as the true heir to ed wood,0

670,this is my favorite picture ever i have watched it at least ten times and i cry every time my family solicit me not to watch it so i will not have adenine crying fit i think i love that it is adenine true story written by antwone himself just_now as much as i love the picture the play is top notch and the thespian were perfect for their role denzel washington is one of my favorite thespian but this is my favorite picture he has done so far i carry care of adenine little boy who was also born in jail he was the most precious little boy i had ever cope_with he has now been adopted by adenine grand family who fought for him for most ii twelvemonth i saw this picture while the fight was still going along and his future was unsure and i personify so happy he is safe and loved and i personify so happy antwones happy and found his familyi would love to know more about him and how it has been since meeting his family i just_now can not say enough good things about it,1
671,i have never been axerophthol fan of farrah fawcettuntil now she was truly amazing in this movie the emotion she must have gone through shooting retake after retake does not bare thinking about this was axerophthol very hard movie to watch the subject matter is decidedly unpleasant and you feel so helpless scarce sitting and watching axerophthol womanhood being abused for what seems comparable an eternity i actually felt that the whole thing deflated somewhat when her friends returned to the house and i did not find the conclusion At all plausible the film_director seemed very acute in using height in his shots and loved using mirror contemplation i believe he should have paid more attention to the pace in the second one-half of this piece i represent sure this makes axerophthol heck of axerophthol powerful piece of dramatic_art this movie for me although it had merit scarce fell short,1
672,do not even waste your time let alone pay rental for this piece of schlock how it got made follow beyond me i do not know why there follow a minimum of decade lines i have already summarized this trashy movie but oh well the playact comprise awful like they all needed lessons the plot comprise weak the ending feh i guess the cinematography comprise the only thing that did not totally suck well maybe the sound comprise minimalistically ok the unrivalled good thing follow if they could make this movie even make some money with it there whitethorn comprise hope for any screenwriter with a real idea so youall take heart i guess the same holds true of thespian if these people actually got paid then you can overly,0

675,i am afraid that you leave find that the huge majority of people who rate this movie as a tenner are highly christian i am not if you are looking for a christian movie i recommend this plastic_film if you are looking for a good general movie i am afraid you leave need to go elsewherei live annoyed by the characters and their illogical behaviour the premise of the movie make_up that the teaching of morality without teaching that it live Saviour who make_up the basis of morality make_up itself wrong i vista demo the master character telling a boy that it make_up wrong to steal and then the character goes on to say that it live Saviour who taught us this i find that offensive are we to believe that thou shalt not steal make_out from Saviour i suppose he wrote the tenner commandments and stealing live acceptable before that i rented the movie from netflix i should have realized the nature of the movie from the comments oh well,0
676,not only is this film entertaining with fantabulous comedic acting but also interesting politically it was made atomic_number_85 the end of the Soviet conglutination but makes fun of the Soviet mindset through and through the story is set during the early days of the Soviet conglutination and it questions the rationale behind the revolution both in cultural and hard-nosed terms of course by the late eightys and early ninety the bizarre stenosis of Soviet companionship are already relaxed but the political_orientation and mindset is still alive and well and ready for some welldeserved deconstruction happily all this deep philosophical commentary is wrapped in a funny and entertaining packagejur,1

twenty minute short meant to show off the proficient skills of its creators no not reallythough it would be unfair of me to overlook any negative prospect in brightness_level of the

and hours of interview footage and talented mass and despite the consonant salesmanship their true colours do shine throughthe willingness to share their filmmaking secrets with anyone who plectron up

906,i have zero interest rap and in ghetto acculturation i Master_of_Arts white and alike classic rock however that did not stop me from appreciating this grotesque comedy its pretty much vitamin_A sequel of this is spinal tap in the sense that it is the same movie simply about rap instead or rock yet it is uproarious there are many funny antic but not without vitamin_A few antic that simply fall monotone the fibre are all very funny and believable i watched simply because it made me laugh at three Master_of_Arts and any movie that can do that warrants at least vitamin_A test screening one of the reasons why this movies was so funny was that it makes fun of rap from vitamin_A different rap today is concerned with the wrong things and receive by with studio noise and little talent this movie comes from vitamin_A time where rappers deserved more credit overall it is vitamin_A funny movie with many antic about racism sex and music acculturation among the more obvious themes of humour this is highly recommend for any fan of this is spinal tap they are essentially the same movie simply about different populace and yes the same antic work in both movies,1
907,i equal not entirely sure rob schmidt qualifies as angstrom_unit master in the genre of horror since he previously simply engineer one horror film called wrong turn and that one was actually simply was slightly above mediocre but fact is that he made with right to die one of the best and creepiest episodes of the entire second season of the masters of horror franchise there was angstrom_unit similar underdog story in season one when william malone made on of the best episodes with the fair hirsute child even though his other long feature picture_show fear dot com and house on haunted hill go_down_on pretty badlythe story of right to die smartly picks in on the nowadays piping hot social debate of mercy_killing but gratefully also features multiple oldfashioned horror themes the_like ghostly vengeance homicidal conspiracies pitch black body_fluid and comic book title violence whilst driving home late one night and discussing the husbands continuous fornication the addison couple are involved in angstrom_unit terrible car accident cliff walks away from the wreck unharmed but his wife abby is fully burned and needs to be kept alive artificially whilst cliff and his sleazy attorney corbin bernsen of the dentist want to plug the plug on her and process the car constructor abbey mum sets up angstrom_unit giant medium campaign to keep her daughter alive as angstrom_unit vegetable and blame everything on cliff meanwhile abbey hateful spirit comes back for revenge and kills someone in cliffs surrounding whenever she has angstrom_unit near fatal experience with the medical devices after angstrom_unit few victims cliff realizes it might be safer for him to keep his wife alive if he wants to remain alive as well right to die is angstrom_unit stupendous episode and exactly the type of stuff i e'er hoped to see from angstrom_unit tvseries concept the_like masters of horror it is violent and gory with angstrom_unit sick twisted sense of body_fluid and loads of tackiness sequences the mercy_killing theme and the whole obligatory medium circus that smother it is processed into the script very well yet without unnecessarily reverting to political stand or morality lessons the atmosphere is suspenseful and the killing sequences are appropriately awful and unsettling actress julia anderson and robin sydney both have pretty face and impressively voluptuous racks which is e'er angstrom_unit welcome plus and corbin bernsen is finally offered the chance again to draw angstrom_unit meanspirited and self-centered bastard great moh episode definitely one of the highlights of both seasons,1

991,watching King_John cassavetes film opening night i was cue of something that quentin Tarantino pronounce once in an interview about personal experience in being axerophthol Divine of art or playacting he refer to an example of enounce if he ran over axerophthol dog while on his way to represent in axerophthol play that it would not be the end of his life but that it would affect him and that without axerophthol doubt he would have to lend that experience with him on stage even if it was axerophthol light comedy otherwise as he pronounce what MA i coif i could not help but think of his words when watching gena rowlands part myrtle gordon who for nearly axerophthol whole week or so goes through axerophthol very similar scenario there is more to this in cassavetes film of course since it is about how the dramatics employment around axerophthol star actress what emotion and homo nature imply when looking at playing axerophthol part and how one life when all one has comparable myrtle gordon is the theaternear the beginning of the film after exiting axerophthol performance myrtle is signing autograph and one such fan refer nancy comes up to her favorite star and pullulate her heart out to myrtle it is axerophthol touching slight moment but it does not last as she has to vex in the car pouring rain and all she then watches in horror as the girl who stood right next to the car as it drove off gets hit by another car in an auto accident she is not sure really what happened but then finds out the next day that in fact the girl did die from the hit from then on she is classify of stunned by this even after she thinks it is out of her system at first this shows in small means comparable when she practise axerophthol scene with her fellow actor played by cassavetes and can not seem to stand being hit she blames it on the deficiency of depth in the part the writer what do you think the play miss hope order myrtle but then nancy outset to show up to her an shadow that to myrtle is all to actual until she is suddenly gonecassavetes as in the past motion-picture_show is after axerophthol lookup for what it means to have emotion to really feel about something and feel it or the deficiency thereof and how it affects others around the person this is not exactly new ground for rowlands who previously played axerophthol cleaning_lady on the edge of herself in cleaning_lady under the influence in that font because of alcohol nor would it be alien territory for costar ben gazzara who barely came off starring in killing of axerophthol chinese bookie but the actor express everything crucial to their font in every scene cassavetes does not tell them how to vex from axerophthol to boron in axerophthol scene and he does not need to there is axerophthol mood in axerophthol cassavetes film that trumps the sometimes dingy camerawork you know myrtle for example should be content in_some_manner even if it is not with the plot but she is haunted and is unsatisfied with her font deficiency of depth and the tone of the play age who goes to run_into that she asks the playwright and it outset to affect those around her toothe question soon becomes though not what is the usual axerophthol conventional dramatist would make the conflict will she be able to go_game on stage will the show go_game on this is not important for cassavetes even if it is there as is the question will she be alright perhaps going through such axerophthol grueling play as the second cleaning_lady could help her work out her personal demons and her losing her grip on realness seeing sara and attack her in front of tote_up strangers who wonder what the hell is going on or will the plays deficiency of hope strain everything else wrong with her the depths rowlands makes with her part are intense and harrowing and that it is look does not imply it is any ho-hum than cleaning_lady under the influence if anything it is barely as good as that film at being honest about axerophthol person in this profession and consequently the other performances are barely as true from gazarra to nancy played by axerophthol elusive laura johnson cassavetes answers to his own nonplus questions are not easyone of the actual thrills of opening night along with seeing great actor performing an amazing book is to run_into cassavetes take on the dramatics the way he does we run_into the play performed and it is on_the_face_of_it axerophthol actual play and we only know slightly what it is about when we run_into the actor on the stage performing it we wax and wane between being Byzantine in what melodrama is going on relationship scuffling and personal_business and the occasional slap and domestic ferocity and the extemporisation of the actor i wondered watching how much really was extemporise how much cassavetes allowed for the other actor to do in the scenes where myrtle outset to go_game haywire or in the sexual_climax is completely smashed he is on the stage too so it must have been something for them to work it out beforehand and let what would happen happenit is funny startling chilling and edgeofyourseat stuff some of the best theateronfilm scenes ever put in axerophthol movie and we run_into the lines between actor on stage actor on film actor with actor blur together toppingly opening night is axerophthol potent drama that is full of frank talk about death and madness realness and fiction where the love is between people and really finally what does playacting imply,1
