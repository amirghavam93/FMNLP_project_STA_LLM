when i unsuspectedly rented a thousand acres i thought i was in for an entertaining king lear story and of course michelle pfeiffer was in it so what could go wrongvery quickly however i realized that this story was about a thousand other things besides just acres i started crying and could not stop until long after the movie ended thank you jane laura and jocelyn for bringing us such a wonderfully subtle and compassionate movie thank you cast for being involved and portraying the characters with such depth and gentlenessi recognized the angry sister the runaway sister and the sister in denial i recognized the abusive husband and why he was there and then the father oh oh the father all superbly played i also recognized myself and this movie was an eyeopener a relief a chance to face my own truth and finally doing something about it i truly hope a thousand acres has had the same effect on some others out theresince i did not understand why the cover said the film was about sisters fighting over land they were not fighting each other at all i watched it a second time then i was able to see that if one had not lived a similar story one would easily miss the overwhelming undercurrent of dread and fear and the deep bond between the sisters that runs through it all that is exactly the reason why people in general often overlook the truth about their neighbors for instancebut yet another reason why this movie is so perfecti do not give a rats ass pardon my french about to what extend the king lear story is followed all i know is that i can honestly say this movie has changed my lifekeep up the good work guys you can and do make a difference,1

this movie was so frustrating everything seemed energetic and i was totally prepared to have a good time i at least thought i would be able to stand it but i was wrong first the weird looping it was like watching americas funniest home videos the damn parents i hated them so much the stereotypical latino family i need to speak with the person responsible for this we need to have a talk that little girl who was always hanging on someone i just hated her and had to mention it now the final scene transcends i must say it is so gloriously bad and full of badness that it is a movie of its own what crappy dancing horrible and beautiful at once,0
i was truly and wonderfully surprised at of brother where art thou the video store was out of all the movies i was planning on renting so then i came across this i came home and as i watched i became engrossed and found myself laughing out loud the coens have made a magnificiant film again but i think the first time you watch this movie you get to know the characters the second time now that you know them you laugh sooo hard it could hurt you i strongly would reccomend anyone seeing this because if you are not you are truly missing a film gem for the ages tenten,1
this movie spends most of its time preaching that it is the script that makes the movie but apparently there was no script when they shot this waste of time the trailer makes this out to be a comedy but the film cannot decide if it wants to be a comedy a drama a romance or an action film press releases indicated that shatner and hamlin made this movie because they loved the script what were they thinking if you like william shatner i do see free enterprise instead,0
after a very long time marathi cinema has come with some good moviethis movie is one of the best marathi movies ever made it shows how a old grandfather tries to save his grandsons eye he tries everything that is possible in his hands to save the childs eye doctor and a relative of his tries to help him in his attemptthe acting by the grandfather the boy and the doctor are simply superb they have shown true picture of a typical marathi life every bit of action has some meaning in it i would recommend to watch this movie as initially i thought this one would be of documentary type but this was above my expectationsthis film is really going to touch your heartsi would expect more marathi movies to come up with performances like this,1
this is a really sad and touching movie it deals with the subject of child abuse it is really sad but mostly a true story because it happens everyday elijah wood and joseph mazzello play the two children or lorraine bracco a single mother who just tries to make a home for them while living with her parents a man who likes to be called the king comes into their life he hits the youngest boy bobby but the two brothers vow not to tell their mother but finally she finds out after the bobby is hurt badly the end kind of ruined it for me because it is so totally unbelievable but except for that i love the movie,1
do not pay any attention to the rave reviews of this film here it is the worst van damme film and one of the worst of any sort i have ever seen it would appeal to somebody with no depth whatever who requires nothing more than gunfire and explosions to be entertainedseeing that this is directed by peter hyams it has made me realise that peter has no talent as a director but is very good at filming explosions and the like however movies need other elements as well for example a story this one did not have one this might explain the awfulness of some of mr hyams more recent films hardly any better than this one reallyone cannot help wondering how some people ever were put behind a camera,0
porn legend gregory dark directs this cheesy horror flick that has glen jacobs kane from wwfwwe whatever it calls itself nowadays in his cinematic debut he plays jacob goodknight a blind serial killer who is forte is taking peoples eyes out the plot be it as it may has a group of troubled youths cleaning up the historical hotel that goodknight resides in and subsequently being offed by him hemmingway it is not starts of as fun dopey bmovie but soon gets too tedious to be enjoyable glad i went in with pretty low expectations but even those were not met how can you have a porn king directing and still suffer from a lack of nudity for shamemy grade d eye candy samantha noble bares her ass briefly,0
this was a great movie something not only for black history month but as a reminder of the goodness of people and the statement that it truly does take a village to raise a child the performances by s eptath was outstanding mos def and his singing was off the hook had to do a double take when i saw that was rosie perez there but the supporting cast of actors and actresses made this worth watching all the different stories they had was amazing and how nanny protected jr and literally everyone else that was in her presence i can truly understand her being the matriarch of that time period and even more so how tired she was in helping everyone cannot wait for it to come out on dvd it would be a welcome addition to any movie library,1
if you are a fan of turkish and middle eastern music you are in great luck this film is a documentary of current music in istanbul spanning the traditional to the modern it is very good you could not do better if you went to istanbul yourself we get interviews with orhan gencebay concert clips of modern musical icons a road show with a romani gypsy audience turkish hip hop surprisingly very very good and much much more some of the best female vocalists i have ever heard a kurdish woman singing in a hamam steam bath who will rip your heart out lots of social and political background if this is your thing you will have a grand time i could barely sit still in the theatrecd soundtrack now available on amazon pricey,1
ok it was a risky move to rent this flick but i thought i had nothing to losewell i was wrong this is next to bloodsurf the worst horrormovie i have ever seen crappy actors crappy technical output crappy story and so on the soundtrack though is not to bad that is why i give it a two on the vote and not just a one and of course the cats are a positive surprise by far the superior actors in this movie do not rent or buy it stay away from it and hope that this horrible horrible film will vanish to some obscure existence and not become a cult classic it most definitely do not deserve any recognition,0
these days writers directors and producers are relying more and more on the surprise ending the old art of bringing a movie to closure taking all of the information we have learned through out the movie and bringing it to a nice complete ending has been lost now what we have is a movie that no matter how complex detailed or frivolous can be wrapped up in five minutes it was all in hisher head that explanation is the directors safety net if all else fails or if the writing was not that good or if we ran out of money to complete the movie we can always say it was all in hisher head and end the movie that way the audience will buy it because well none of us are psychologists and none of us are suffering from schizophrenia not that we know about so we take the story and believe it after all the mind is a powerful thing some movies have pulled it off but those movies are the reason why we are getting more and more of these crap endings every directorwriter now thinks they can pull it off because well fight club did it and it made a lot of money so we get movies like the machinist secret window identity and this movie just to name a few,0

dirty harry goes to atlanta is what burt called this fantastic firstrate detective thriller that borrows some of its plot from the venerable dana andrews movie laura not only does burt reynolds star in this superb saga but he also helmed it and he does not make a single mistake either staging the action or with his casting of characters not a bad performance in the movie and reynolds does an outstanding job of directing it henry silva is truly icy as a hitmandetective tom sharky burt reynolds is on a narcotics case in underground atlanta when everything goes wrong he winds up chasing a suspect and shooting it out with the gunman on a bus during the melee an innocent bystander dies john woos the killer replicates this scene anyway the atlanta police department busts burt down to vice and he takes orders from a new boss frisco charles durning of oh brother where art thou in the basement sharky winds up in a real cesspool of crime sharky and his fellow detectives arch bernie casey and papa brian keith set up surveillance on a highpriced call girl dominoe rachel ward of after dark my sweetwho has a luxurious apartment that she shares with another girldominoe is seeing a local politician hotchkins earl holliman of police woman on the side who is campaigning for governor but the chief villain victor vittorio gassman of the dirty game wants him to end the affair hotchkins is reluctant to accommodate victor so victor has cocaine snorting billy score henry silva of wipeoutterminate dominoe billy blasts a hole the size of a twelve inch pizza in the door of dominoes apartment and kills hersharky has done the unthinkable during the surveillance he has grown fond of dominoe to the point that he becomes hopelessly infatuated with her sharkys mission in life now is to bust victor but he learns that victor has an informant inside the atlanta police department the plot really heats up when sharky discovers later that billy shot the wrong girl and that dominoe is still alive sharky takes her into protective custody and things grow even more complicated he assembles his machine of the title to deal with victor and his hoodswilliam frakers widescreen lensing of the action is immaculate unfortunately this vastly underrated classic is available only as a fullframe film fraker definitely contributes to the atmosphere of the picture especially during the mutilation scene on the boat when the villains cut off one of sharkys fingers this is a rather gruesome sceneburt never made a movie that surpassed sharkys machine,1
i am fifteen usually not kids my age usually watch these old classic movies but this is one of my favorites i was totally addicted after watching it for the first time it is really good if you think about technology and movies back at that time music is great storyline is okchoreography is great must see it i do not know why there is a prequel for this movie not many people like this movie but i love classic love movies they are so much better than movies now this movie will make you smile cry and make you start dancing the music is absolutely ear catching and beautiful i have not seen dirty dancing two harvana nightsprequel prequel should have star the original actors that is what i hate about prequels they ruin the original no one wants a prequel they want a sequel many people will agree that for a movie the original sequel and the threerd one is enough beyond that people will not be bothered to watch it who remembers the movie about the st benard beethoven i think there is five movies altogether,1
the story is a turnofthecentury troupe of actors along with producers and theatreowners have very complicated relationships a resident playwright has written a psychological drama he wants to get a good production on stage but cannot unless he convinces a pariticular reviewer to revisit the production and give a positive review if his production does not go on then the troupe will put on the doll house recently written by ibsen many different relationships among the principals are explored none of them interesting but the involvement of the characters with one another lead to giving the play by the resident playwrght a second shotthis movie is purely an excuse for the director and his friends to get together and put on a movie the story lines are incoherent to anyone who is not a buddy of one of the stars the only reason i did not leave the theatre after about a half hour is that a fat lady was resting a full meal atop her stomach at the end of my row,0
a holiday on a boat a married couple an angry waiter and a shipwreck is the reason to this films beginningi like boobs no question about that but when the main character allies with whoever happens to have the most fish at the moment mostly by having sex with them and playing the role of the constant victim my anger just rises to a whole new level take two guys a husband and another man put a pure bombshell woman in the middle of them ad a deserted island subtract all her moral issues ad a whole bunch of moral issues to the men and mix it in a big bowl of arguments fish and a zippo lighter and you will come up with a piece of junk movie like this the acting is i would say good there are some bloopers but not many as far as i could see the main female character makes me sick this is due to her lack of moral values the man with the most fish gets her attention even though one of them is her husband she sees no problem with being unfaithful with manuel the other man because i must do it to survive how can you justify having sex with another man for fish when your husband is thirtyfeet away and he will not even benefit from it the female character has absolutely no problems to justify anything that she does if she doesent get approval for her actions she is a victimi recommend everyone to see this movie this is the kind of movie that will make just about everything else you see this year a pleasant movie experience,0
definitely a movie for people who ask only to be entertained and who do not overthink their movies lots of action lots of great dialogue eg fun to quote a little intrigue and stuff blowing up all over the place samuel l jackson and geena davis had great chemistry violent but not gory the fact that the female part was the competent action lead is a pleasant turnabouthave seen the movie more than a dozen times and still enjoy it enough to put it back in my favorite films rotation every three or four months i initially rented the movie because samuel l jackson was in the film but was caught up in the events surrounding samanthas quest to regain her memory and have never looked backall you cerebral folks out there  suspend disbelief for once take yourself a little less seriously  you might actually enjoy yourselves,1
if hollywood had the wellbeing of the audience at heart we would see twenty films a year with the kind of wholesome fortitude that is behind this film there are several experiences of personal growth in this movie and while the characters are still very human even the lessons learned are not that greed will profit you or dountootherswhateveryouwantaslongasyouareokaywithit no this is what our sad desensitized lives need more sense more love more dountoothersasyouwouldhavedoneuntoyou more hope thanks ursula this movie has an intelligent wit not yo mama cracks that run rampant in the socalled comedies people need to feel good this movie will make you feel good and possibly inspire you to better your life and the lives of others sidenote every person counts in ticket sales this is a truly independent film if you want more quality films you have to support them,1
i was expecting a lot more of this film than what i actually got the acting was just awful from everyone and the story was far from impressive it took a lot of something i do not to even follow what was going because it was so jumpy an example of the acting is when paxtons character vann is upset the south vietnamese colonel for so he throws some of the sand from the sand map it was impossible to get any idea of what he was feeling and his actions were robotic to make things worse i have no idea how i am supposed to feel about vann he is obviously presented as the protagonist but as soon as he gets to vietnam he starts an affair with an vietnamese english teacher the only thing the movie had going for it was that it was not particularly boring i give it four stars out of ten,0
coming from kiarostami this arthouse visual and sound exposition is a surprise for a director known for his narratives and keen observation of humans especially children this excursion into minimalist cinematography begs for questions why did he do it was it to keep him busy during a vacation at the shore five five long takes consists of you guessed it five long takes they are the title names are my own and the times approximate driftwood and waves the camera stands nearly still looking at a small piece of driftwood as it gets moved around by small waves splashing on a beach ten minuteswatching people on the boardwalk the camera stands still looking at the ocean horizon and a boardwalk people walk across the camera frame their faces too far and blurry to make them interesting eleven minutessix dogs at the waters edge the camera stands still looking at the ocean horizon with a sandy stretch of beach nearby far away at the waters edge six dogs not doing much just relaxing sixteen minutesducks in line gaggle of ducks the camera stands still looking at the ocean horizon near the waters edge dozen and dozen of ducks stream in single file from left to right i assume that kiarostami released them gradually the last two ducks stop dead on their track and suddenly a gaggle of ducks rolls quietly from right to left i assume kiarostami collected the ducks and rereleased all at the same time it is not the first time that he deals with the contrast between organized and disorganized behavior eight minutesfrog symphony oops i mean cacophony for a stormy night the camera stands over a pond at night it is pitch black except for what appears to be the reflection of the moon on the undulating water it is a stormy night and clouds race to cover the moon the screen goes dark what remains for us is the cacophony of frogs howling dogs and eventually morning roosters hit me on the head if this was done in a single take i saw this segment as a sound composition put together in the editing room and accompanied by a simple visualization twenty seven minutes except for the mildly amusing ducks this exercise in minimalism left me cold a nonessential film for kiarostami admirersi thought i would rate five a five but four is what it deservesthe film is dedicated to yasujiru ozu,0
in the early zeros production companies had a shortlived craze for supernatural genre movies in france after the crimson rivers and brotherhood of the wolf turned out to be hits so several movies were greenlit or saved from their directtovideo fate however france as opposed to the us uk or italy has little tradition of fantasy bmovies and it turned out quickly that samouraïs bloody mallory or the crimson rivers sequel were illadvised attempts at recreating a kind of magic that had never existed in french cinema in the first place as they flopped producers have gone back to their usual fare derivative farces or the umpteenth selfreferential tribute to french new wave by a former critic from les cahiers du cinémabrocéliande could only have been greenlit during this short window as it serves no other discernible purpose it is your bythebook slasher movie mixed with vague mythological element and horror references and you will find bimboesque female characters a french university looking like a us campus and plot twists so lazy you do not even care because you had guessed it by yourself an hour before even before the movie startedthese elements make all the fun of a seventys or a eightys bmovie and you expect them in a seventys or eightys movie however we are not in the eightys anymore and nobody warned director doug headline as this tribute to the slasher movie genre is nothing more than a derivative slasher movie headline himself is no rookie and has been writing as a critic about this kind of pictures since the early eightys but as a first time director he shows a lack of skill and ambition that makes brocéliande a borewhen you put together clichés from a movie subcategory and hand them to a skilled and inventive director such as wes craven or quentin tarantino you get a scream or a death proof movies that are imitations from old guilty pleasures but also magnify these clichés and add a great deal to them that is called talent and that is why you cannot confuse these recent movies with their original inspirations shot decades agobrocéliande takes the lazy path and only reproduces the worst elements from past movies unfortunately for the male viewer the gratuitous nudity is mostly missing there are very strong similarities presumably unintentional between the plot of brocéliande and the reviled halloween three season of the witch as both deal with supernatural druidic evil rituals and some silly attempt at taking over the world on halloween night as even the plot of halloween three makes more sense than this one it means that something seriously wrong went with brocéliande,0
i was so happy to learn that hari om will finally be theatrically released in two thousand and seven i saw this film three years ago at the vancouver international film festival and have been waiting for it is release ever since so i could send everyone i know to see it it is like taking a trip to indiacolorful magical thought provoking aside from one rather strange hollywood style auto rickshaw chase scene this movie is very realistic this is not a bollywood style song and dance movie but it does have drama and romance and humor the interactions between the indian taxi driver and the french tourist are a good reflection on the fundamental differences between eastern and western life styles and philosophy the characters are a little broadly drawn but the acting was very good visually this movie is a treat as you really do get a sense of what driving through rajasthan is likedreamlike sometimes it is hard to believe everything you are seeing and experiencing is realthe movie has that same quality great soundtrack too,1
the gates of hell opened up and spit out this film then closed againwatching this movie makes me appreciate other movies i have seen like all other movies nothing makes sense in this movieit would really take too long to mention all the plot problems in fact except as a warning it really is not worth wasting some of the nearly infinite space available on the internet writing about this filmfrom now on i will check imdb before watching any filmhot darn imdb is forcing me to write more about this film i guess i should warn you about edison force while i am at it but if you had to chose between the two pick edison force,0
in love and war is a simple feelgood tvfilm and should be viewed as suchpossible spoilerit is the story of a wwii british soldier newby captured with his commando by the italians and imprisoned in a former orphanage as the italians surrender to the allies the commando is freed and attempts to flee however the germans arrive and the commando is captured again only newby injured remains at large the rest of the film recounts how he is hidden and protected by the partisans and his survivalend of spoilerbased on a true story in love and war is a refreshingly straightforward film half comedy half romance the story is simple and unambiguous the atmosfera is warm and sunny and the various stereotypes the desperately unorganized or romantic italians the serious sternlooking germans and the phlegmatic and pragmatic british although unoriginal are still humorous nicola piovanis musical score also adds to the mediterranean flavouralthough it is far from being a tea with mussolini or a la vita e bella in love and war is a sweet simple film that will put a smile and maybe even a little tan on your face,1
not much to say other than plenty of wirefu and supposed sholin monks egotripping about kungfu and caricature japanese plotting to take over china all of this would not be so bad if not for the utterly fake japanese sword fighting if you watched a samurai movie or two you can tell that the japanese fighting in the movie is simply the same kungfu really circus acrobats stunt men doing the same things except with a japanese sword however there are a couple of fun moments such as when a japanese woman ninja tears off her clothes in midflight to disarm a monk and captures him with a fishing net storywise there seems to be a bit of schizophrenia as far as whether the japanese should be shown as completely despicable or if there could be exceptions the japanese protagonist is shown as largely honourable but not beyond unwarranted cruelty such as when he murders a sedated monk so that he may have his duel quite disappointing with a very silly ending does not for a moment evoke even the semblance of the idea of an epic battle,0
it could be easy to complain about the quality of this movie you do not have to throw cartloads of money at a movie to make it good nor will it guarantee that it is worth watching but i think that is totally missing the point if your expecting fast cars ta or a movie that will spell itself out for you then do not watch this you will be disappointed and dumbfoundedthis movie was thoroughly enjoyable kept us on the edge of our seats and made us really think the writer obviously put a lot of thought and research behind this movie and it shows through the end just remember to keep an open mindnote the school scenes were all filmed at mcmaster university and most of the rest was done in toronto,1
i have always loved old movies but this is one of my top ten favoritesit has all the charm one thousand nine hundred and fortys quaintness and good old fashioned romance and it is hilarious to boot barbara stanwick plays an independent single woman who writes cookinghome life articles for a famous magazineunder the premise that she is a married homemaker even the president of the magazine is under this delusion enter a handsome gi played by the talented dennis morganjust rescued off of a raft along with his buddy his simple wish is to stay at the homey inn the she writes so eloquently about and relax with her famous homecooked meals she now has to frantically find a way to save her job and reputationadd to this that her fiancé is in a hurry to tie the knot does not help the humor is superb and the chemistry between the leading characters a lot of fun throw in the characteractor nicknamed cuddles who fits this name completely it becomes even more adorable this has become my mustsee movie that i snuggle in with a cup of cocoa each christmas season a wonderful enjoyable movie to enjoy at christmastime or anytime,1
i absolutely loved this movie great realistic looking combat footage for one thing and a touching genuine story also the calm understated manner of the lead character franta makes him very likable the human relationships in the story seemed so very typical and possible of what you could expect in war time the bond between franta and carel shows the loyalty wartime comrades can have for each other and that is often described in books and interviews with veterans the subtitles do not detract from the story at all and actually serve to underline the problems the czech pilots had in the raf the postwar storyline is a great reminder that for many the suffering of wwtwo did not end in one thousand nine hundred and fortyfive especially in russian occupied countries the cinematography was also very good wish i could have seen it on the big screen,1
intended as light entertainment this film is indeed successful as such during its first half but then succumbs to a rapidly foundering script that drops it down harry judd nelson a reformed burglar and daphne gina gershon an aspiring actress are employed as live window mannequins at a department store where one evening they are late in leaving and are locked within whereupon they witness from their less than protective glass observation point an apparent homicide occurring on the street the ostensible murderer miles raymond nick mancuso a local sculptor returns the following day to observe the mannequins since he realizes that they are the only possible witnesses to the prior nights violent event and when one of the posing pair flinches the fun begins daphne and harry report their observations at a local police station but when the detective taking a crime report remembers harrys criminal background he becomes cynical there are a great many ways in which a film can become hackneyed and this one manages to utilize most of them including an obligatory slow motion bedroom scene of passion a low budget affair shot in vancouver even police procedural aspects are displayed by rote the always capable gershon tries to make something of her role but mancuso is incredibly histrionic bizarrely so as he attacks his lines with an obvious loose rein although the film sags into nonsense cinematographer glen macpherson prefers to not follow suit as he sets up with camera and lighting some splendidly realised compositions that a viewer may focus upon while ignoring plot holes and witless dialogue a wellcrafted score appropriately based upon the action is contributed by hal beckett the mentioned dialogue is initially somewhat fresh and delivered well in a bantering manner by nelson and gershon but in a subsequent context of flawed continuity and logic predictability takes over the direction reflects a lack of original ideas or point of view and postproduction flaws set the work back farther than should be expected for a basic thriller,0
this is just one of those films which cannot justify much of anything that happens these people are going on a trek the young girl wants to photograph animals there really are no piranhas but i guess the psychotic hunter guy is the real piranha anyway there are lots of animals and there is lots of driving there is considerable antigun talk but we all know where that is going toward the end there is lots of action and a rape thrown in somebody must pay and they do it would have been nice to have a couple of piranhas to sort of fill the thing out there were lots of monkeys if you fast forward through the dull parts you have a tight little five minutes,0
it is really too bad that nobody knows about this movie i think if it were just spruced up a little and if it were not so lowbudget i think one of the major film companies might have wanted to take it i first saw this movie when i was eleven and i thought it was so powerful with the many great yet illegal lengths that mitchell goes to just to keep his family together it inspired me then and it amazes me now if you are lucky enough to find a copy of this movie do not miss it,1
unlike terms of endearment and steel magnolias i left the movie theater feeling very disappointed i started to get into the characters and their complex motherdaughter and fatherdaughter relationships at the beginning i even cried but i had no sympathy for the characters with the ending the final act did not seem in line with the mothers character at all so although the acting was pretty good i thought the movie on a whole was disappointing,0

i recently rented this video after seeing final ascent by the same writer i was not prepared for how intense this film would get i found it engaging from start to finish and was rooting for the teenagers to get away with their attempted crime the ending was definitely disturbing with some of its implied violence but welldone i highly recommend this picture,1
lovely music beautiful photography some of scenes are breathtaking and affecting but the dramatic tension is lost in a film that is so poorly edited it is hard to know what exactly is going on at times the dialogue is incomprehensible then there is richard gere he is supposed to be a factory worker who gets into trouble and gets work on a farm we see dozens of farmhands sweaty and dirty in the hot sun then we see gere looking like he just wandered away from a calvin klein ad sam shepard another glamour guy is supposed to be terminally ill but he looks great nice try but it just does not work brook adams try hard but she gets lost in the scenerythe real star is the girl,0
as everyone knows nobody can play scarlett ohara like vivien leigh and nobody can play rhett butler like clark gable all others pale in comparison and timothy dalton and joanne whalley are no exceptions one thing that i really could not get past was that joanne has brown eyes the green eyes were the most enhancing feature of scarletts good looks and in this sequel she has been stripped of thosethe movie as well as the book had several lulls in it the new characters were not all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever it could be that i am only eleven but i saw no change in her attitude until the last say ten minutes when rhett told her she had grown up if rhett had not told her that i would have never guessed that there was any change in her attitude she really loved cat her baby she likes this child best because she had it with rhett her only loved husband still if you have read gone with the wind you would see that children make no difference in scarletts world quite frankly it seemed to me like there was way too much going on without rhett all anybody cares about is whether or not rhett and scarlett get back together and scarlett took way too long to get to that it is virtually nothing compared to gone with the wind but then again what is not if you have read the novel you will like that better than the moviei would watch it just because it is the sequel to gone with the wind regardless of whether or not it is worthwhile it may not satisfy you entirely but it will get you some of the way there,0
a very sensitive topicfifteen yo girl abandoned by mother as a baby and who goes to visit her continues to be ignored is raped by her moms boyfriend becomes pregnant there was not enough depth displayed of this situation too much of time is taken up on the chase with the truckers transporting the baby interesting this baby with asthmayou never see him cry except once be fed have is diaper changed during the whole truck transport ordeal i would have liked to have seen more of the interrelationships more focus on the fact that this girl was a minorthis should have stood up in court immediatelyand this was a true story it deserved a better telling than thatif it were not for the subject matter i would have given this closer to a zero rating i rented this from the library only later i found out it was a made for tv movie oh well,0
this is about some vampires who can run around out in the sunlight that are causing some problems down in south america casper van dien is sent in with his team of commandos to investigate the movie opens with van dien  co walking through the jungle and there is this huge black guy who just absolutely positively cannot act he speaks all his lines as if he is reading them off the cuecards for the very first time his voice is also so low that well it is positively hilarious great way to get the movie started anyhow they run into some of our vampires shoot them this causes them to appear to die for about twenty seconds and then of course they come back to life van dien notices that one of them was impaled across a tree limb and yells to his buddies to kill them with wood the stunt work must be seen to be believed  the vampires are on wires that pull them up trees which is supposed to make them look like they can climb really easily but it just makes them look like they are bouncing around on bungee cords or somethingyeahanyhow later on the huge black dude is down in south america with some guys van dien not included and they are attacked by more vampires it is really too bad these guys never heard of a crossbow because it would seem to be the perfect weapon to kill the little bloodsuckers with but instead they use big old wooden stakes that they try to impale the vampires with by hand the big black dude ends up getting captured and he eventually becomes some big powerful vampire leader van dien ends up battling him later on it does not help that all through the movie everyone forgets that if you shoot a vampire they are knocked out for twenty seconds or so which would enable a person to stick a stake in them fairly easily they just try to stick stakes in them in the middle of handtohand combat yeah not exactly brilliant tacticsthere is a hot babe remember veronica from the lost world tv show yes it is her who also happens to be walking around in the middle of vampire county on some sort of research mission and she also just happens to be van diens exwife hey what are the odds it is a shame she is not in the movie a whole lot more than she is will her and casper get back together in the end will van dien defeat the huge black dude who cannot act will the circus performer vampires make you laugh through all the numerous action scenes will we hear the three stooges music when somebody does something funny has even lynda carter forgotten how to act in her small cameo she is more convincing in her sleep number bed commercials these questions and more will will be answered if you make it all the way to the end of the moviei do not know it might score some points on the so bad it is good scale but that is about it eh it is a bunch of goofs running around in the jungle i guess it is kind of entertaining,0
this film is bad it is filled with glaring plot holes characters who are ruled by stupidity bad acting and above all a poor script which has been done before in many many films only better i feel sorry for donald sutherland i just hope he had to do this film rather than wanted to miss it,0
this movie is so bad that it actually gets funny one of the worst movies i have ever seen in my entire life the funny thing was that the trailer had scenes in it that was not in the movie just by watching the trailer i would have saved a lot of my time it actually showed everything that happened in the movie except for the conclusion and that was also so obviousit is honestly hard to think of a reason why this movie was made this is just so bad horrible i would give it zero out of ten if that would be possible there is nothing else to say about this movie,0
well where to start describing this celluloid debacle you already know the big fat nada passing as a plot so let us jut point out that this is so pc it is offensive hard to believe that frank oz the same guy that gave us laugh riots like little shop of horrors and bowfinger made this unfunny messso this guy does not know he is gay till this actor points it out ok sure if anyone ever says i am gay i will know the truth even if i currently like girls more than george luca likes a dollarand how to know the true nature of my sexuality well if i like classic litterature dancing and barbra streisand i am gay if i dress like a blind man in a hurry with half my shirt hanging out i am straight oh sureand here is the big cliché of clichés no matter how you look there is always a very attractive hollywood actor who will adore every bit of grease under your skin or a top model who will love your zero iq your buttugly face and your pointingout ears if all those gay common places were not enough to get me angry this did in real world looks matter folks and i know for surei see it coming now you will say relax it is a comedy do not take it so seriously if being a comedy gives anything carte blanche to suck out loud i think the world has a serious problem would not be much better and funnier to make a movie to denegate those old tiresome clichés instead of magnifying them over and over againso one of the absolutely worst movies i have ever seen one out of ten if giving this rating has something to do with my sexual tendence please let me know i am interested,0
i really liked the movie the emporers new groove but watching this was like coming home and seeing your wife having relations with a llama seriously this movie was bad it is like club dread after super troopers i am supposed to write ten lines but i do not even know what else to say i laughed a couple of times but only because i was drinking a movie like that should at least be funny when your drunk it was not maybe llamas are just funny and regular cartoon people are not either way just stick with the emporers new groove if you want a funny cartoon llamathemed movie line ten is this line right here,0

i have done a lot of international travel both on business and as a tourist for both types i assure you the best advice is also the oldest always drink the wine of the country in this movie the archangel michael comes to earth on business wraps it up quickly and decides to hang around for a little touring boy does he drink the wine of the countrycould man be drunk forever with liquor love and fights he would lief rise up of mornings and lief lie down of nightsthese are things you cannot do in heaven so he enjoys them while he is here of course it turns out he had a couple of other jobs to tackle and if he is less direct about them than he was about the first one he is just as successful the final scene is a little schmaltzy but it is also wonderful jean stapleton gets to dance with john travolta,1
late night on bbcone was on my way to bed but curiosity piqued at a contemporaryset irish film so i stayed to watch for a few minutes and then stayed to the end i have to admit that the main attraction was the only english actress kelly reilly who is stunning to look atthis is billed as a black comedy which is one of the hardest things to pull off it should be the perfect blend of horror and horrible laughs so that in the end you do not know why you are laughing  for me martin scorseses after hours one thousand nine hundred and eightyfive is the best example dead bodies is more black than comedy but the plot rattles along and spirals down towards further blackness i did not spot the final twists in the tale as some other posters here did so i was suitably surprisedas a snapshot of the irish film industry in two thousand and three it all seems rather worthy it does not look like they spent too much on the making of it so it had a chance to make its money back the script could have been a whole lot sharper but the acting was on the whole pretty good i am glad i watched it flaws and all though i do not think i learnt much about ireland today especially their policing methods,1
absolute grabber of a movie and given its age years ahead of its time i first saw this the week my dad came home with a neighbors tv that the guy had thrown on the scrap heap a tinkerer with all things electrical dad had it working inside two days this was july one thousand nine hundred and fiftyfiveand then probably only the third house in the street to have television pretty much the first thing we ever saw on that grainy and flickering old twelveinch screen was this film it is pretty old dear i recall my mom telling mealmost fifty years on and it does not seem any older  rather like world war i in that respect terrific little fantasy about a london omnibus carrying thirteen passengers that crashes killing one of their number then in flashback we pick up on the lives of these people and what brought them to being on this bus that very dayreturning to the crash at the end of the film the victims identity is revealed perhaps the inspiration behind the one thousand nine hundred and sixty movie the list of adrian messengerif ever you come across this little gem i suggest you watch it,1
i saw le conseguenze dellamore on the two thousand and five rotterdam filmfestival it was the first of ten films i saw therele conseguenze has left the most powerful impression of the ten films from the first shot you know the movie is going to be something special the beautiful cinematography left me in awe of what can be done with a camera the music is also on par with the visuals complementing the colorful and stylish architecturelike imagestoni servillo plays the main character in the film titta he is a tax expert gone wrong who lives in a hotel every week he brings a suitcase with money to a bank and the story plays around thishe is always very controlled and shows almost no emotion to anyone looks calculated and welldressed he has a habit of ignoring people who are of no significance to him for example sofia played very nicely by olivia magnani who works as a barmaid in the hotel where he lives although she is been working in the hotel for two years he never greets her even if she does greet him on one day she confronts him with this and the next day he sits at the bar instead of his usual spot at a window from here the story really begins and will unfold in a strong tale of love sacrifice and the mafiai will not spoil the rest of the film see this film if you love stylish movies like ones from david lynch the godfather etc do not see this if you are an actionbuff,1
a not so good action thriller because it unsuccessfully trends the same water as early steven seagal films because there is not a very good set piece steven seagal plays the same kind of character that he has played since above the law in my opinion the performance of keenen ivory wayans is wasted in such an average film and belongs in a much better film bob gunton is okay as the main heavy the best acting in the entire film belongs to brian cox who is very frightening in the role of the murderer my favorite scenes are the fight scenes with the russian mafia one of the film reasons to see the glimmer manone thousand nine hundred and ninetysix is for the brief appearence of the beautiful and voluptupus nikki cox its too bad that there were not more scenes with her in them,0
fantastic chaplin movie with many memorable moments as charlie joins the army to fight in ww oneat first he goes to boot camp where he has to learn how to handle his rifle and how to walk in line that is a really funny scene as the tramp is not used to keeping his feet straightnext thing you know he is in france in a trench hilarious scenes here include a starving charlie eating the cheese of a mousetrap and reading a letter from home over someone is shoulderwhen charlie goes to sleep he finds his bunker all flooded and his roommate snoring this is such a funny part i cannot really describe it just watch the movie when charlie wakes up his legs feel numb so he tries to wake them up it had me rolling on the floor when it turns out his second leg still feels numb while charlie actually rubs his roommates footthe movie then turns a bit grim as charlie shoots a couple of germans from his trench although it is done in a very funny way and him personating as a tree to get close to the enemy saving a friend of his from a death squadlast part is him getting a french girl in trouble by hiding in her house he then has to save her and while doing so he captures the german kaiser as well to do so he impersonates a german kolonel or something i love it when charlie is asked something in german and he is like nein nein nein the soldier looks at him in a funny way so charlie changes his mind ja ja ja the kaiser gets captured and charlie is the hero but then he wakes up again in bootcamp it was just a sweet dreamcharlie did one of those dreamsequences before the bank comes to mind but who cares this movie was so funny it had me laughing all the way chaplin also has something to say with this movie as his later work became more of a social comment to several mishaps in the world and is explained best in the last sentence of the movie peace on earth good will to all mankindin short a charlie classic very funny timeless nineten,1
it is to typical of people complaining about something when they no nothing about itso this is about a gay man falling for a straight women first of allthis is a true story so you cannot say its not believable second its written by a gay man so the whole thing about this being against the gays are just plain stupid personally i think this was the best love story i have ever seen and i am very pro gay i think this shows that real love is about personality not just looks and sex and it has nothing against anyone who is gay straight or bi unlike so many other shows maybe we in europe take to it more cus most tv here are a bit deeper and make you think more then american tvplus we do not fear when it comes to showing certain thingsif you want something funny with one of englands best lesley sharp and you want to see a decent believable love story without too much sap this is for you i know i love it,1
this series takes a classic story and makes rubbish of it robin is somehow mystified by an elkman in the forest and is embroiled in all sorts of druidism and outright satanic episodes the story is more about him avoiding the evil sheriff than helping the poor this is barely watchable and to top all the ridiculousness they kill robin at the end of series two and replace him with another actor some people may like this show as a fantasy show but it is not a robin hood show if you want robin fighting in king richards name against prince john and the sheriff and if you want robin feeding the poor and oppressed watch the classic series or the newest from the bbc,0
there is a good running bit about the price tag of a silk negligee the bimbo in the office shows off the bargain she got for twentytwo closeup of tag later mary astor finds the tag in the bosss bedroom proof that bimbo slept with him still later mary astor is about to have an affair with ricardo cortez looks at the price tag of her silk negligee fourteen and is reminded of how disgusted she was about the bimbo as well as the fact that she is spent eight less than the most obvious woman she is ever met it sounds an obvious morality turn but it was well done the film would be stronger if robert ames character had been played by a more powerful actor he is too lowkey for a selfmade salesman and he spends most of the film with his face turned away from the camera and if ricardo cortez had been given more to do than smile ironically both male leads are bland and forgettable and are hindered by the pancake male makeup so popular in this films era however the mary astor character is interesting appealing and believable behind closed doors is well worth seeing,1
i especially liked the ending of this moviei really felt what the characters must have felt which i think is a mark of good directing i was tickled with how the new hire at the record store turned outgreat character development there even though his role would probably be considered minori was also impressed that the entire film while dark in its subject matter was free from gratuitous nudity profanity and violence sadness sexuality and darkness can all be communicated often better by what is left unsaid but it seems that this is often unique to really classy films and actors kudos to the filmmaker for that,1
i remember seeing this film in the mid eightys thought it a well paced and well acted piece i now work quite often in berkeley square and the had to get a copy of dvd to remind myself how little the area has changed although my office is newish it just thirty seconds away from the bank even jack barclays car dealership is still there selling bentleys and rolls roycesit is look like the dvd is due a region two release soon the region one copy i is very poor quality let us hope they have cleaned it uponly the slightly dodgy escape sequence from the court spoils what would otherwise be a great film but i guess is in line with the caper tag the film goes with,1
i was not able to last ten minutes on the this terrible film in and age of dv cameras it looks to have been shot on vhs without aid of any color correction or microphoneas a filmmaker myself i know the constraints of indy filmmaking and even keeping those things in mind i am amazed films can be made this poorlythe only praise i can offer is that this film got distribution as i have seen considerably better films still seeking modest domestic or international release i am guessing the box is what sold itit does have good box art but it all goes downhill from thereside note it seems the director has eleven friends since no one on the this planet would give this film a ten,0
at first i did not think that the performance by lauren ambrose was anything but flaky but as her character developed the portrayal made more sense amy madigan seemed too terse for her role and did not really tie her daughters characters together even though it was apparent that her character was disengaged with the character played by lauren ambrosechristopher lloyd is a hit as usual and carried off his role to encourage the story line his character development left the audience wondering why he was chastised by the younger characters and could have been accomplished more directly with the overwhelming glue to this somewhat vague story line was play by taylor roberts her comprehensive delivery of a simplistic character held the movie together in this pivotal role taylor was able to encourage a realistic family relationship between the characters while acting as the antagonist for all of the other relationships in the film,1
i would like to point out these excellent points in favor of this movieone angelina jolie sex scene two foley artist outdid themselves three plot was quite thick four dvd does includes trailers and chapter stopsfive no animals were harmed in the making of the movie six homages to blade runner through out the film seven burning trash cans eight funny guy with no legs nine voice overs by jack palance added a real dynamic element to the film ten sage advise for example when you dine with the devil bring a long spoon eleven angelina jolie was only eighteen to sum it up an evening of entertainment was provided,1

just above the box i am typing in now i was required to pick a number between one and ten and rate this feature film unfortunately there is no option for a number less than zero and i have to put something if i had my choice i would just put nothing no number because there exist no digits that express the worthlessness of this movieif you do decide to watch this film even after reading all of these horrible reviews make sure there are no sharp or blunt objects in the area this will help prevent you from trying to kill yourself in the middle of the filmi do not know how this film was released to the public it should be locked up and guarded twentyfourseven somewhere in fort knox i am angry that this film was even available for me to watch i feel cheated by humanity i had no idea humans could be this cruel stalin saddam and hitler got nothing on this douche bag cowelldo not be fooled by the movies cover one there are no scarecrows no one knows why there is a legit looking scarecrow on the front twonone of the characters on the back of case are even in the stinking movie three the tag line says something about new moon more victims there were no frigging victims no one even died we do not know if the dam cop died and i am assuming the killer did not die because it sounded like he was being hit over the head with a frigging whiffle ball batdo yourself a favor and stay away from this movie it wasted about four hours of my life that is right four it took an hour for me to watch it i fast forwarded thru the four minute zooming scenes that reveal nothing in the plot i stared at the television for about an hour after it was over contemplating my life and the direction it was heading after watching this crap and then i began to cry for the next two hours because i know someone out there will unfortunately see this movie and there is nothing i can do to stop it,0
nbc should be ashamed i would not allow my children to see this i definitely would tell my church to stay away this movie is proof as to why nbc has always been a threerd rate network the producers actors and writers should get on their knees and beg gods forgiveness for making this work of fiction there were no pirates noahs wife did not parade around on the deck of the ark the ark had no deck lot was not even born when this event took place did anyone attached to this project try reading the bible there were more than two animals of each type taken read the story in genesis how could anyone bring this to any screen small or large,0
film critics of the world i apologize it is your job to give advice to the moviegoing public so that they can wisely choose what to spend money on but i ignored your advice and i have been deeply hurt however my decision to see the cat in the hat was not made haphazardly you see three years ago all of you critics said that we should all avoid the calamity known as how the grinch stole christmas then some friends of mine took me to see it and it turned out to be a colorful funny and almost hypnotic yuletide treat so when the critics unleashed their fury against the cat in the hat another big budget seuss update with a big name star in the title role i thought that it must be the same old song how wrong i wasfor five whole minutes i thought i was in the clear the opening credits are clever the kids are charming and the production values are top notch then the cat showed up there are many problems from this point on but the biggest one was the woeful miscasting of mike myers where the grinch was saved by the inspired casting of jim carrey the cat was destroyed by myers he can be very funny when his energies are applied where they belong comic sketches every movie he is made that was truly funny was really just a feature length comedy sketch from waynes world to austin powers so he tries to do the same thing here it is just that these comedy sketches are more like the stuff that they stick at the end of snl not funny just painful not that the writers helped him out any after the charming prologue the movie turns into an hour of repulsive bodily humor gags poorly timed pratfalls and insultingly stunted attempts at hip humor this movie was the most disheartening cinematic experience i have ever had period so much talent and work went into something so vile i know that the adult stars of this movie will be relatively unscathed by this mess i just hope that the wonderful spencer breslin and dakota fanning will get more chances to show their charms in far better movies if you are a parent please avoid this like the plague with movies like elf and brother bear currently in theaters you have far better choices,0
there are certain scenes in this film like the heros first meeting with supervillainess shirley eaton where it seems to be on the edge of breaking sexual taboos and doing its premise females want to rule the world by making men slaves justice but it never dares to the result is a film with no sexuality and some tame violence despite the choppy plot the film is not overly bad until its climax where its amateurishness runs rampant terrible editing overuse of stock footage worth seeing only as a curio onetwo,0
this movie makes me laugh by even just thinking about it such a smart comedy very precise yet easy the casting can not be any better all actors are the best choice of their roles and they all play precisely the best and there is no stupid laughs or shouting through out the whole movie layers and the progress of story work perfectly together and the rhythm flow smoothly the greatest of all is when the village peoples ymca is cued in it brings out the importance of the indians statute which was only briefly brought up previously in the movie which makes the smartest and funniest climax among many comedies i give it a ten especially a lot of times comedies are so underrated,1
this movie is really bad trying to create scientific explanations for zombies always ends up taking away credibility from the history of the movie there are so many things i could point about the movie that i could almost write a book on how much the movie sucks for instance there were like fifty people on the plane they killed like one hundred and they kept coming apparently the virus gives hepatic complications because everybody had yellow eyes also the virus makes people roar like lions or something and the virus not only regenerates tissue as it also gives superhuman strength not to mention that this virus messes up peoples hair it is also important to notice that if you shoot someone with a pistol probably only happens on planes that person is kicked back in the air remember that if you are escorting a prisoner on a plane and you loose him always look inside the drawers and cabinets the size of a bottle you never know where those bastards are going to hide and if by any chance you can land a plane full of zombies against a mountain and survive happens all the time after watching dozens of people being killed just walk away from the plane watching the sunrise and making jokes about dating the flight attendant ,0
some would argue this is better mainly because of the acting but it is indeed far worse for reasons that outweigh the improvementthe source from which all the problems stem the story aside from one of them people being shot point blank with a shotgun in the chest and surviving for hours without medical attention there is a bigger problem nic the gangsta with the golden heart is willing to do anything for the friend he just met that day and that includes asking an evil spirit for help cece who comes out of nowhere with a past in voodoo is willing to summon killjoy so long as nic can hook her up the acting while improved is still horrid these people could not convey emotion out of a paper bag the script does not help them either stupid lines and i can only assume no direction from the director this script was read like shakespeare in high school with a teacher whipping them as they wentwhile this movie if you can call it that at its eighty min run time thankfully is perhaps even funnier than the first because of all these things it is definitely more painful to watch oneten,0
just a short comment i want to say that i like this movie very much sandra bullock is my favourite actress i like the whole story from the beginning until the end i have it on tape and i can watch it a one hundred times it does not matter,1
when i was young i was a big fan of the naked gun movies but just recently i watched the show police sqaud and i think its great leslie nielsons awesome alan north is cool and who the heck is rex hamilton but anyways it is one goofy showone of my favorite parts of this show when they do the freeze frame scene during the end credits i think my favorite one is when norberg not oj walks in during the scene and he tries to fit in with the freeze frame classicthe only problem to me is the cigarette gag gets very old when drebin shows a cigarette to someone and asks cigarette and the person replies yes i know i think they used it too many times by whatevergood acting good gags great showseventen,1
seeing the names of the starring actors statham snipes and phillippe i thought that the movie should at least be decently funny or interesting instead all i got from it was not just boring ninetytwo minutes but the frustration of knowing everything that was about to happen and hearing tons of lame and shabby bad cop phrasesthe main problem is that the movie does not have a good story to begin with and when you have that than no one can help you not statham not wesley snipesnot even john mcclane could save this movie  it could be cool for the kids if they are not over twelve years of age because they do not care so much about the story and there are some big explosions in the movie,0
i used to always love the bill because of its great script and characters but lately i feel as though it has turned into an emotional type of soap if you look at promotional picturesposters of the bill now you will see either two of the officers huggingkissing or something to do with friendships whereas promotional pictures of the bill a long time ago would have shown something to do with crime this proves that it has changed a lot from being an absolutely amazing police drama to an average type of television soap when i watch it i feel like i am watching a police version of coronation street or something similar i have to say i still like the bill as i am interested in police work and that type of thing but i really miss the greatness that the bill used to have i want to rate it as two out of ten because you have to admit it has been totally ruined by the people who took the bill overas for the script and characters they have both gone downhill most of the great characters are gone now although a few still remain i think and i am not saying that the newer characters are poor or anything because they definitely are not its just that they lack the tough looks personalities and script lines that all of the old characters used to have because most of the new ones are at the moment involved with silly relationships and family troubleoverall being one of the only police programs on television these days the bill will always be a crappily interesting thing to watch but like i say it has lost a lot of its uniqueness if that is the right spelling and would now be classed as a terrible unreal television soaprecommended to watch for a good laugh over the stupidity of the police officers involved  twoten,0
i am a regular reader of kathy reichs temperance brennan novels as such i am extremely surprised she even consulted on this showit is horrible by comparison to the books the temperance brennan character is in the books a down to earth recovering alcoholic and divorced mom of a college aged daughter in bones she is an arrogant rhymes with rich who in typical p c fashion is not a mother the emphasis on her assisting staff complete with lurid details of who has had how many sexual exploits is totally in contrast with the booksin total deference to the p c movement she portrays the enemies of the you s as peace lovers  some of the information is not even correct for example having a character from afghanistan as an active member of an arabamerican friendship group since when is an afghan an arab i am sure if negative references were made to disadvantaged minorities or women or glbts the shows producerswritersdirectors would have to issue an apology however in typical far left fashion all of the racial slurs go to the highest achieving minority groupasians as david boreanaz agent booth continually refers to angela montenegro as a squintforget that stuff and forget this show after the man in the suv episode i thought i would try a second episode to see if it got any better it only got worse i do not even care if the teenager in question was murdered or committed suicide and i will not be watching the show ever again,0
i saw this movie on the strength of the single positive review and i can only imagine that guy is a shillthe acting of the female lead is actually quite good but the entire film is just so excruciatingly boring i could hardly bear to sit through it this is the very definition of dullnessso far this film is rated as eight out of ten on seven votes that must mean the director directors girlfriend producer actress and drinking buddies have given their own film a tenfor the rest of you who simply want to be entertained or enjoy a good story avoid thisthis man on the street shall give it a two out of tenfda note while this movie can be used as an aide to obtaining a good nights sleep no medicinal value is implied or offered,0
this movie is an amazing comedy the script is too funny if you watch it more than once you will enjoy it more though the comedy at times is silly but it really makes you laugh salman khan and aamir khan have given justice to their roles after one thousand nine hundred and ninetyfour i have not come across any hindi movie which was as funny as this,1
i saw this movie and i do like horror moviesi did not know what to expect but as soon the movie was on his way it was nice to watch it the idea was pretty original and the acting was nice especially jenna dewan as the excitingevil tamarathe hardest thing about horror movies is to make a good ending but there the movie failed for a change a endscene in a hospital where suddenly all employees are gone first you see doctors and nurses running around but then they all went homeno cries for help while being chased by tamara escaping to the roof also a smart movenot and off course a kind of open endingnothe movie started great the main part was nice to watch but they really messed up the ending using all clichés from bad horror movies jeffrey reddick failed in my eyes with this movie after making some really quality movies like final destination one and twoif you like a good horror full of cliché endings tamara is a good movie to watch for me i like movies which surprise me,0
a truly masterful piece of filmmaking it managed to put me to sleep and to boggle my mind so boring that it induces sleep and yet so ludicrous that it made me wonder how stuff like this gets made avoid at all costs that is unless you like taking invisible cranial punishment in which case i highly recommend it,0
this is going to be my first review on imdb and i am glad that the standard rating is one out of ten because then i do not have to change anythingfirst there are awful movies movies you can make a laughter out of like island city battlefield earth or conan the destroyer that is totally acceptable they makes a great party enhancer then there are the worst movie ever i cannot believe how utterly crappy this steaming pile of dog turd wasi found it on a second hand store on vhs and bought it quickly because i like scifi terminator postapocalypse and stuff like that everything on the box art was very promising then i loaded in the tape quickly when i got home and the first thing that i noticed was what there was maybe ten minutes or more of switching between present clips and flashbacks in a very annoying blue effect with sounds that makes you puke and it just continues over and over then some acting kicks in and you wonder why you were ever born in a world where this abomination of mankind actually exists and then i realized there are actually two prequels i did not think about it first but the title says three in it and i was horrified but as i actually in great pain and agony watch it to the end i thought nothing could ever make me feel worse about myself and this universe but then a little text showed up saying next and nemesis four no please no,0
as far as i know this was my first experience with icelandic movies it is such a relief to see something else than your regular hollywood motion picture too bad that movies like this one have a small chance of succeeding in the big world i can only hope that people watch this by accident by recommendation or otherbecause it is really worth while i left the cinema feeling really sad i could not get the tragic destinys of the characters out of my head and it impressed me even more when i thought of the complexity of the film not only was it a tragic story it had excellent comic reliefs and a very good soundtrackif you have the opportunity watch it it is really thought provoking and made me ponder a lot,1
all i can do is echo the sentiment already expressed by some of the other commenters this is city of god meets happy days the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a loves diaper commercial is completely unconvincing you can approach it in one of two ways one a gritty realistic movie turned sappy or two a sappy abcafterschoolspecial with profanity violence and animal cruelty either way it just do not fly do it why then has it received so much praise as others have implied it gets the conscience vote from the west show us pictures of poverty to contrast against our fluffy doublewide theatre seats and fortyfouroz cokes and we will applaud in a heartbeat butohdo not forget to candy coat it because the bitter pill of reality tantalizing as it is is hard for us to swallowi am terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there all i can say is beware of any film that receives awards hollywood oscars  sweeping syrupy tripe cannes film festival  beardstroking artless propaganda to find the real gems you will have to work hard at it,0
first the positives an excellent job at depicting urban landscapes to suit the mood of the film some of the shots could be paintings by de chirico sophie marceau beautifulthe negatives the stories are hard to believe unreal unidimensional characters preen and posture one hundred of the time as if they were in some kind of catwalk this is neither the antonioni of his earlier much better movies nor the wenders we have all come to know and appreciate malkovich is excess baggage in this movie,1
now and again a film comes around purely by accident that makes you doubt your sanity we just finished studying the novel northanger abbey at school and decided to refresh our memory of this unexciting piece of humourless garbage with the bbc adaptationthe funny thing about northanger abbey is that it actually makes you want to kill yourself the film is nothing like the book for example the subtly evil characters seem to have been turned into transparent stereotypes john thorpe looks like a leprechaun on acid while isabella plays the role of slut catherine the main character is the most depressingly stupid and irritating actress on gods earth she looks like a coffee addict her eyes are like basketballs whilst mr tilney looks and acts like a retired porno stunt double the plot goes completely off the rails at certain points of the film i do not know what the hell the director was thinking when for no reason at all a seven year old black kid who we have never met before takes the main character out of the abbey and starts cartwheeling in front of her yes that is right cartwheeling nonsense of this kind is occasionally interrupted by catherines fantasies in which she is being carried around a cathedral by an ogrenorthanger abbey is basically visual euthanasia so if you want to murder your boss or something like that bbc have basically discovered a new way to kill someone northanger is a barely laughably bad film do not watch it unless you are in a padded cell,0
what an awesome miniseries the original traffik completely stole me away from anything else that was on far more engaging than the american remake the original traffik boasts an amazing cast formed of lesser known actors to north american audiences juliette binoche being the mainly recognizable actress who plays a drug addicted teenaged daughter of a government official but it is not star power that carries this film though i enjoyed the american version i felt it was dimmed by the famous americans in the picture unfortunately i saw the american version before i found the original bbc miniseries of course there were no picture filters lush locales and the big name starsdirector however the grit and grime of europe through the drugworld perfectly compliments the impending sense of danger which permeates throughout this film the problems such as getting addicts off of drugs by giving them more poor antidrug campaigning and the resistance of foreign governments to assist with destroying their drug cultivators from within all make traffik bold immersive and horrific all at the same timethe truly incredible portions of the movie all come from pakistan my god i never knew how bad the problem really was over in europeeven all over for a real education on the problems of drugs beyond how they affect the human body you must watch both this and the american version each show one very clear and undeniable fact those countries which are leaders in the eyes of the world have a culture that has led to the death and suffering for many drugs are worse than war they work in the shadows the dark secrets of any successful society,1
it has a bit of that indie queer edge that was hip in the ninetys and which places an explicit sellby date on the visual style characters are uniformly apathetic and farcically deadpan street hoodlums in greece wear new clothing out of the box without creases or stains they all appear to visit the same marine hair dresser all uniformly exhibit the same low iq when making their dispassionate underground business deals when things go wrong its all because they are not real greeks  they are pastoral sunshine boys caught in a strange night city world makes a big whine about disaffected immigrants but never bothers to actually investigate the problems with russiankazakhalbanian cultures if giannaris had the proper perspective on this project it might have made a wonderful bel ami production the fleeting glimpses of toned boybeef is the only spark in this generic smalltime mobster programmer,0
i watched pola x because scott walker composed the film score and i admire his music a lot frankly i expected a somewhat pretentious and possibly incoherent french movie i was wrong the vision of the film quickly managed to engage my attention to the fullest  starting with the opening sequence which shows black and white footage of military airplanes throwing bombs at graves at the sounds of music and scott walkers beautiful wailing voice the film explores the identity crisis of pierre guillaume depardieu  a brilliant choice for the role and his consequential selfdestruction the story is divided into two parts  the first depicts pierres carefree life in a beautiful house in the french countryside and the second follows his utter personal disintegration after he abandons everything and moves to paris to live in squalor with his supposed halfsister both parts contain some amazingly stunning photography  the first very colorful and bright the second utterly gloomy and nearly apocalyptic  adding up to a true aesthetic feast pola x is a fascinating and quite unique movie experience,1
you can tell that this is the first offering by the director who also wrote it but you can also see the potential this guy has this is an obviously low budget film in the spirit of boondock saints of course boondock saints came out a few years after this so you could look at this as a diamond in need of some polish the acting was good  if you are looking for deniro or michael madsen in a crime drama remember that these are young guys playing young guys trying to be criminals they are not going to be supercool tm like some of the veterans i would have love to have seen justin pagel joe  the main character go on to make more movies  he was great in this good movie  three stars out of five,1
this film was incredible looked high budget but felt heartfelt and original like an indie the most amazing part of this film were the astonishing performances by david beazely mark hildreth and paul anthony who plays the main role he carried this film with ease humor and charisma balanced with a huge depth the cinematography was really beautiful even though some of the subject was quite ugly it was not very realistic in that way but it did not have to be to make a larger point it was really great seeing alan cumming in this too the script was tight and propelled very nicely with some of the best acting i have seen in a whilego see this,1
i viewed my videotape last night for the first time in at least ten years i found the work itself and the performances just as gripping as they were in my memory george hearn of coursewas the master of the role of sweeney there is never a touch of softness in his determination to wreak vengeance on those he believes caused his wifes death and his daughters disappearance at least not until the end when he discovers that his thirst for revenge has led him to murder his wife angela lansbury on the other hand creates a more complex portrayal as mrs lovett she understood that sondheim wanted that role to be something of a comic counterpart to sweeney and even brings some tenderness into her courtship of sweeney and her nurture of the boy tobias for those with long memories this performance takes one back to her debut performances in the picture of dorian grey and gaslight long before murder she wrote only a year ago i saw the musical at lyric opera of chicago with current opera superstar brynn terfel as sweeney others have commented on the operatic quality of the score my conclusion is that sweeney works better with actors who can at least handle the vocal lines than with opera performers who have limited acting skills as a final note i commend the performer who portrayed tobias with his mixed loyalties and confusion about what is going on around him it seemed appropriate that he had virtually the last word,1
heart of darkness was terrible the novel was difficult enough to understand but when a production company decides to release a film loosely based on it then that just messes everyone up not only did those in charge decide to change certain characters and completely eliminate others but the acting was horrid and the overall impression i got from the movie was that it was a complete dud i watched the film in hopes of understanding the novel a bit better but it just threw me and my fellow classmates off completely i think the movie was a waste of time and i was disappointed to see tim roth in such a disappointing film especially when he has awesome flicks like pulp fiction and resivior dogs under his belt same with the very cool john malkovich,0
i was having a horrid day but this movie grabbed me and i could not put it down until the end and i had forgotten about my horrid day and the ending by the way where is the sequelthe budget is obviously extremely low but  look what they did with it it reminds me of a play they are basically working with a tent a escape pod a few guns uniforms camping gear and a scanner thing that is it for props maybe this is even a good thing forcing the acting and writing to have to step up and take their rightful place in film as the centers of the work instead of as afterthoughts used to have an excuse to make cgi fights starwarsthe cgi is fine it is not exactly seamless but imho it still works why because there is not too much of it and what there is is not taking over with an army of effects house people trying to cram everything they can into the shot it prompts the imagination it is some relatively simple stuff with decent composition especially the heavy freighter shot there is one long shot that must be at least ten secondsthat tracks the entire length of the ship it must be a record for sci fi battle sequence film making in the past ten years to have an action sequence that lasts longer than zeroseventyfive seconds and some relation to the story it might look old or not state of the art but it does not look stupid and it does not take away from the storythe acting is good except the characters die too fast to get to know them the captain was great but a few of his scenes could have used another take i also got confused with his character losing his cool and stomping on a corpse i like to think captains are calm cool and in control what was going on in that scene did the other crew worry about him losing it at that moment did he feel himself losing control now as for the plot mostly it is good why because it does not try to explain itself it just happens it is called the planet its a mystery get it nobody knows why there is a statue and they do not find out either the mysterious cult the weird scientist with the tattoo what do you expect to find out in less than ninety minutes this is not war and peace and thank god it is not star warstrek either no midichlorians no five minutes of expository boring dialog that has no purpose in the story the characters are stranded and are only able to figure out a few basic things it is not a star trek episode where they find out it is leonardo davinci or a child like space wanderer it is mysterious and i liked that i do not know why maybe i can identify with these guys more  since they do not know what is happening and i do not either they do not talk a lot of space gibberish or have magic boxes telling them what is happening in fact i would argue that one of the weakest moments is when the traitor turns on the crew and tries to explain the reason for the planet the cult etc this coincidentally has some of the weakest dialog imho in the whole movie and it interrupts the flow and some of the characters look unnatural in that scene ok sometimes i felt it was a little too mysterious though like why did the guy get fried through his eyes with lightning that was odd just weird the hamlet ending again i would have liked to have known some of these characters better and would it have been so hard to have a thirty second rescue scene at the end this is not a serial show it was a film and we like closure in films even if they can have a sequel imagine hamlet with no flights of angels sing thee to thy restanyways what can i say this was well worth the dollar i payed at the red box machine at the supermarket it was also imho a better piece of storytelling than starwars parts one two or three like i said it sucked me in wanting to know what was happening and i could not stop watching until the end,1
two hands is an entertaining funny story about australian lowlifes the screenplay contrasts the world of fast money and deadly acts with the inexplicability of fate and circumstance in a subtle way we are asked to ponder the concept that major events in our lives are sometimes generated without our being fully aware of the root causes the forces of fate and circumstance take jimmy the main character into situations that bring about the realization of his shallow dreams and ultimately an understanding of a more personally promising worldthe clueless jimmy portrayed with acumen by heath ledger is a kid who grew up without opportunity the high paying world of crime offers the greatest appeal to his blunted senses the love and help of friends guides him to a higher plateauthe film is welldirected and wellacted the band of criminals teeter between likable and despicable keeping us interested in their crazy antics all through the film,1
just watched this today on tcm where the other reviewers here saw itsorry that i was the only one to find davies a weak actress with a truly awful attempt at an irish irishamerican or otherwise accent as she is the star it was sort of hard for me to get past that  especially as the other reviewers have said that this was her finest performanceanother particularly terrible davies performance was in marianne one thousand nine hundred and twentynine which i also watched today in this film given a nine of ten rating here her accent switches from that of a correct french woman to an odd combination of italian and swissinterestingly in tcms onehour bio of davies  captured on film the true story of marion davies two thousand and one  film historian jeanine basinger claims that one of the things that you note about marion davies in her sound work is how good she is at doing accents of course this bio also includes commentary by fans make of that what you willdavies was a very attractive young woman and by all accounts a terrific comedienne in real lifeand because a part of her anatomy added immeasurably to the reallife answer to joseph cottens characters search for the meaning behind kanes final word in the opening scene of the great citizen kane she is earned her spot among the great stories if hollywoods historybut i think welles  mankiewicz got it right for the most part with the susan alexander facsimile of the real articledo not bother voting as to whether you agree or disagree with this post as i really could not care less,0
mr baseball was a fun video rental with my fiancé susan nauss susan said that she had been looking forward to seeing the movie ken takakura oda as a tough yet honorable manager makes sense ken takakura has made so many wonderful asian movies i correct the one reviewer and say takakura is still a cinematic presence with films like hotari of course everyone likes tom selleck yet ken takakura is the better dramatic actor of the two today someone accused me of being yakuza well i say that my great uncle shadow president jack f kennedy myself and others are part of the legitimate human leadership in our universe and thanks to our cocreators humans are free people fighting all the parts of adversity that president kennedy talked about in his inaugural address to be honest someone has kept food prices very low in canada on things like bread in honor of our cocreators please stop eating amphibians reptiles and eggs i hope that there will one day be a sequel to mr baseball with father ken takakura oda still as manager thank you to imdb for supporting freedom of speech like the kind president george w bush and i support support imdb,1
opposing force one thousand nine hundred and eightysix was not as good as dr strangelove and it was not as good as the bridge on the river kwai heck it was not even as good as gi jane which is pretty sadthe film revolves around a basic ethical problem in a simulated prisonerofwar situation how far can you go before you start breaking the law what exactly is the law in such a situation how can you simulate the torture of someone without actually torturing someone can you intentionally inflict pain how about breaking bones mock executions sexual abuse severe blood loss real guns with bullets death somewhere between these is a really fuzzy line dividing acceptable from atrociousnow what could you do if you found yourself in such a training program and the lines between simulation and reality begin to vanish what could you do this movie attempts to portray this dilemmai found it interesting to see the types of tactics used in resistance training i have a brother who went through the usafs pow training program according to him it was pretty close to the mark technicallythe film has a fairly good premise but it does not have a particularly good story i wondered if it might be based on some actual event but it became pretty apparent that it was not when the explosions started they must have changed scriptwriters three quarters into the film because it takes a real extreme turn and devolves into a somewhat pointless shootthemup with lots of distracting explosions i found it to have a rather unsatisfying ending again kind of pointless i am left wondering what the point of the whole thing was  i am beginning to suspect there simply was not one it could have been much better with just a little more story to go along with the fireworks,0
crackerjack is another classic aussie film as so many australian films like the castle the dish and sunday too far away it goes somewhere that has not been widely explored in film before this time it is the game of lawn bowls and bowling clubs crackerjack is a much slower paced sports movie than many you will find such as remember the titans or million dollar babybut the characters involved are athletes in their own right this movie is a show case of a large area of australian culture and features a sport that is popular and on the rise of popularity in australia mick molloy presents a classic unforgettable character it really is a must see,1
clearly this film was made for a newer generation that may or may not have had an inkling of charles bukowskis work the autobiographical henry chinaski character in bukowskis stories was brilliantly portrayed to perfection by mickey rourke in one thousand nine hundred and eightysevens barfly also starring faye dunaway anyone who has seen factotum should certainly see barfly to get a better look at how bukowski wrote his character factotum lacks the greasy seediness of bukowskis screenplay and the fearless hopelessness of his loner hero the inadvertent humor that bubbles through in the dark desperation of chinaskis misadventures does not work for dillon as it did so admirably for the overweight filthy bloodsoaked rourke rourkes character makes the pain and pleasure of the previous nights misbehavior a placesetting for yet another grueling ugly day in the life of a drunken misanthropic unknown writer dillons character misses these marks in favor of a strutting handsome relatively cleanlooking want tobe writer that scarcely passes for any moment in that of chinaskis story dunaways sleazy heroine wanda is the perfect complement to the neverdowell henry the women in factotum cannot hold a candle to dunaways distressed goddess and the use of more profane sexual subject matter in factotum proves to be more of a crude distraction than a tip of the hat to bukowskis raw and unapologetic portrayals of dysfunctional relationships i was stunned at how many of the exact same scenes were used in factotum marisa tomei buying all the stuff and charging it to the old man is an exact ripoff from barflyif you want to see the best bukowski stories on film see barfly and love is a dog from hell which also goes by the title crazy love,0
i have seen some terrible booktofilm adaptations in my day but this one tops them all the bizarrely unattractive cast detracts from the story which is in itself untrue to the book mr tilney is nothing like handsome as for catherine morland a ratlike appearance makes this heroine a difficult one to sell to a sympathetic audience isabella is nothing like the aphrodite one reads about in the original text and james morland appears in the film far too little to leave the viewer with any understanding of his important role in the story also as others have pointed out before this novel was intended to satirize the gothic craze prevalent in austens time but it appears that this soft horror film was designed and meant to be taken seriously i am sure jane austen turns over in her grave each time one of her fans is disappointed by this awful interpretation of what was supposed to be a joke,0
i see that c thomas howell has appeared in many movies since his heyday in the eightys as an accomplished young actori bought this dvd because it was cheap and in part for the internetrelated plot and to see how much older c thomas howell is i do not recall seeing him in any movies since the one thousand nine hundred and eightysin just a few words what a very big disappointment i give some low budget movies a chance but this one started out lame within the first fifteen minutes of the movie this elusive woman is chatting with an asian guy in a chatroom they basically stimulate themselves to their own chat she then insists on meeting the participant in person she meets him has sex ties him up and then murders him in cold blood the plot then deteriorates furtherthe plot is thin and flimsy and the acting is very stiff do not bother renting it much less purchasing it even if it is in the one dvd bin i plan to take my copy of the dvd to goodwill i am truly amazed that any of the prior reviewers here gave this movie a bad rating,0
wow what a movie if you want to blow your budget on the title and have it look real bad ask the guys that made this movie on how to do that they could have spent the money on a good rewrite or something else or they could have spent it on beer when they made this movie at least it would have come out better,0
there are few films that deal with things that i would consider myself an expert on this one isafter some years of fantasy role playing we split me not leaving without a sense of shame of what i had become a dorkyou see these things are really canonical it happens to everybodyfirst you create a character fairly and it dies after the first attackthen you help a little with the constitution and while you are at it why not help with strength intelligence intuition charisma and dexterity too this in turn frustrates the game master who does not know how to deal with this invincible gang and after a while it bores the players too so they start to create ever more exotic raceprofession combinations no matter how ludicrous it isi created a druedain warrior monk yeah not that far from the filmand that is not all to be said about the destructiveness of the inherent dynamic of this devilish game think the hunt for experience points but just watch the film it shows it all  and of course the stupidity of its most basic premissesfor this end in turn there is no better profession than the bard i do not exactly understand why the bard became a character in the first place after all the blacksmith is none but once it became one it had to be mapped into the game flow that is it had to be made lethal at least indirectly the poking of fun out of this never comes to an end and rightfully sosure it is not exactly a professional production but i have not seen a better satire in ages,1
one of the best as being a fan of the civil war i was very pleased with the first installment of the north and south trilogy patrick swayze gives and extraordinary performance as well as james reed and leslie ann down in watching this fabulous story unfold into a time never forgotten the subjects of love passion grief shame harmony and cruelty come to life i was first introduced to this series when i was in the eighth grade being a young boy you would think that i would not have been interested in this civil war soap to be honest this story stole the hearts of every one in my class and this is just the first book i bought the novel and studied the likes and differences and it was awesome i am seventeen now and still enjoy the story characters subject and remember the times of the civil war as a movie director of the future i will always enjoy north and south book one,1
i wish i would have read more reviews and more opinions about this movie before i rented it a waste of money a waste of time very little dialog the dialog was hard to understand in every way the storyline and plot were both weak the only thing that was nice at all was the cinematographythe characters were interesting at the same time you will spend so much time trying to figure things out because of the lack of dialog that you will be rewinding the movie a lot do not watch this movie it was a mess and will leave you feeling like a messyou will say what the heck was that when the movie ends,0
today you die was the fourth seagal movie in a mini marathon i just held wow i do not know where to start he seems to mumble his lines more and more as time goes on and the scenes between seagal and treach where they seem to improv are embarrassing and what did his girlfriends dreams have to do with anything else in the plot i cannot recommend this to anyone but the most die hard seagal fan and even then you are better off with his earlier work of the four films in my marathon submerged into the sun foreigner and today you die today was the worst a previous reviewer mentioned this but the usage of stock footage was quite obvious,0
stop me if you hard this one before some cheerleaders their coach and a couple guys are trapped within a cabin in the woods when an unseen killer kills them off one by one shame on me after i totally wrote off jim wynorski after the horrid busty cops it was a long time coming as his last truly good film was one thousand nine hundred and ninetys hard to die i still for some reason got my hopes up for a supposed sequel to slumber party massacre sadly even my mediocre expectations were not met this outing is not nearly as fun as even the three previous films in the franchise and yes i am including spm two that should tell you something furthermore how can you have a slasher film with this little gore i mean come on now my grade d eye candy ricky ray gets topless april flowers and charity rahmer show boobs and buns in a shower scene april gets nude again later in the film and tamie sheffield gets topless and bares buns,0
great cult flick for mstthreek types richard boone is a mess  bad hair arthritis even his dark glasses are not right about as good as a bad dinoflick can get actually that charging sabertoothed styracosaurus was pretty cool  maybe spielberg should take a couple of notes from that one,1
i have fond memories of watching this when it came out it is one of those films that you know is rubbish even when you are a kid but at that age you overlook the ludicrous acting special effects and plot so there is a race of bigbusted nymphets living underground huh and just enjoy the campy monsters for all they are worth,1
i turned this off within the first five minutes it is very sick and disturbing the moment i turned this off was when the beautiful white horse was let into the slaughterhouse and it is skull was punctured by a small tubed instrument this creature was lying on the floor in a state of shock before it died the narrator said the animal dies instantaneously it did not i do not agree with graphic realism towards animals insects or any living creature i was very disappointed as i had just watched eyes without a face which was a brilliant movie and this short film was attached which spoilt my night  as i could not hurt a fly never mind watching this savage documentaryreading other reviews on this page i had noticed they used words such as aesthetic  this is not art or beauty i can imagine that the documentary would be very articulate and profound but not aesthetic,0
family guy when the show first aired it was fresh original and actually quite funny now i have stopped watching it it has become one of the worst shows on television combining unfunny jokes repetitive drawn out jokes and the hope that each joke can become funny with the inclusion of the word bitch seth macfarlane clearly has issues with himself and he is obviously pandering to the thirteen year old boys audiencei just do not understand how something that started out so funny so different from everything else can devolve into this horrible mess of a comedy show i seriously have heard better one liners from a pud comicit truly is sad to see great shows fail and watch drivel like this continue on either seth macfarlane has stopped trying or he believes that this show is hilarious the way it iseither way god help usi hate this show and will dance an irish jig when its finally cancelled,0
this movie defines the word confused all the actors stay true to the script mores the pity because the acting is fine but the script is a confused pastiche of pseudopsychoanalytic random ideas the pacing is mindnumbingly slow and the softfocuslens cinematography gets on the nerves quickly i give it four out of ten,0
this is without a doubt the most hilarious movie i have ever seen seriously if the makers of this movie are ever discovered they will put guys like jim carrey out of a job rent jacko tonight believe me you will not regret it,0
well it is standard hollywood schmaltz that you can see coming a mile off it is enjoyable in parts but just oh so predictable i must confess i did not really enjoy it but i am pretty tough to please and a lot of my friends loved itit is quite sweet and the actors give good performances it is a nice backdrop and the eye candy is pretty good but the irritatingly predictable unoriginal and really quite dull storyline holds the film back personally i can think of better ways to spend a couple of hours of my lifethe chick flick genre gets some bad press but there are some genuinely good chick flicks out there this is not one of them,0
rickman is sexy and good but the stranger is less convincing  reedus is sort of sexy but he is not a consistent actor  this could be the directors fault in this case  we are supposed to find him alluring in the extreme just because he is pretty  but that is not enough the thwarted wife is almost convincing  seven years marriage and she and rickmans character should be more settled with each other whether their roles are to be incompatible or not  they must have patterns by now i get that although i think the wife is a bit stiff in her role  and not convincingly attracted to the stranger  so that is a failing  the unspoken bonding between the rickman character and the stranger is better done even if we are not sure what it is i miss rickmans sexy english accent luckily he slips into it and out of the american pattern disappointing but with some great acting,1
it was probably watching this tv movie that got me interested in the debate as to whether anna was really tsar nicholass daughter anastasia since seeing it i have made a point of watching various documentaries and also bought a book despite the evidence that has been discovered since the film was released i sometimes still think she was such is the power of amy irvings acting in this twoparter which is somewhat liberal with the historical facts but packed to the brim with tearjerking drama and irvings totally convincing performancei was not consciously aware of irving before this though i must have seen her without realizing it in carrie another favourite film in anasasia i never felt for one moment that it is only a film for me this woman was anastasia and when part one ended with her in the railway carriage meeting members of the royal family i knew that come hell or high water i had to see the second part i just wanted to see how she would prove that she was who she claimed to be and as the story progressed i felt an intense hatred of rex harrisons character though i greatly admire him as an actorwhen i saw the movie listed again in the tv guide i convinced my mother that we should watch it and afterward she thanked me for doing so being almost as keen as i had been to watch part two then i bought the video and can totally recommend it anastasia is one of those rare tv movies that you simply must watch for the sheer enjoyment of watching the finest acting i have ever seen on tv and it does not really matter whether you believe the legend or not,1
i saw this fine flick shortly leaving college as i sat there happily watching alice go from repressed virgin to sexual adventurer i got to wondering why her sexual encounters seemed familiar then i remembered intro psych one hundred and one lecture one of the lectures dealt with the psychosexual stages of developement basically the shift over time on what part of the body and its attendant stimulations gets our main attention as well as the changing emphasis on what gives us pleasure alices first encounter is being bathed with emphasis on the genitals and bottom her next encounter is an oral one with the mad hatters dingaling i forget the rest of the lecture and the order of alices encounters but i do remember how well they matched it is interesting to see a skin flick with some brains behind it rather than the cliche i am here to deliver your pizza let us screwi do not see how kristin debells career could be wrecked by this film as it was her first film and reagans tiresome hypocrisies had yet to mar this land when it was released but in a way he and his stooge meese did affect ms debell when meese was staging his antipornography commission to distract people from his own criminal activities meese hired the services of an antiporn activist named judith reisner reisner was obsessed with images she perceived as child pornography she saw the alice cover ms debell did for playboy and promptly announced she had scientifically proven that ms debell was in fact a photo collage of parts from several grown women and the face of a ten year old yeah right,1
every year there is one cannotmiss muchanticipated redhot bigbudget title with the right combination of star director and subject matter that fails miserably at the boxoffice this year it was superman returns in one thousand nine hundred and eightytwo it was blade runner in one thousand nine hundred and fiftyseven it was billy wilders the spirit of st louis a film that had everything  top director huge star bestselling true story about an american hero  except enough of an audience to cover its costs maybe the public still remembered lucky lindys antisemitism and his loud admiration for nazi germanys achievements before the war neither covered in the film which ends with his arrival in paris before the legend got too tarnished maybe because they thought they knew the story or that it was just going to be one guy stuck in a cockpit for two hours certainly wilder and cowriter wendell mayes are aware of the dramatic pitfalls of lindberghs relatively uneventful flight alternating between a wellexecuted flashback structure to key points in his life and the buildup to the flight itself once the film is airborne it is both surprising and suspenseful finding genuine drama in his attempts to stay awake and to navigate without proper instrumentsit also builds up a quite remarkable sense of dread that is unlike anything else in wilders filmography allied to a real sense of the epic shots like the ominous storm clouds over the hanger the dark dawn before the flight carry a real chill of foreboding to them even the typically muted and problematic warnercolor adds to the film rather than detracts from it along with the superb use of cinemascope there is a remarkable score from franz waxman majestic soaring but filled with understated menace and cleverly used as part of the fabric of the film rather than mere musical accompaniment the film does lose points for implying though never actually saying outright that this was a race to be the first to fly the atlantic  in fact lindbergh was the third man to fly across the atlantic after almost completely forgotten brits alcock and browns astonishing flight eight years earlier  but it is still a remarkably tense and engrossing adventure story that deserved the success it never found,1
billed as a romantic comedy set against the early years of wwii it fails to deliver the problem is that while beautifully photographed it has no consistent story line or narrative starting as a murder mystery it offers no hope to its actors as it meanders through recent history depardieu is wasted in a trivial role he obviously is not comfortable with playing adjani cannot carry the picture the hero is not obviously an imitation of a hitchcock wrongly accused role it lacks balance neither heroic comic nor suspensefulthis could have been a good film i am reminded of the lady vanishes which did combine suspense romance and comedy in a serious film dealing with fascism,0
this interesting film noir features three very good performances sanders patrick and blackmer the scenes between sanders and patrick are particularly outstanding demming as the detective is unfortunately not nearly as good he lacks the intelligence strength and cynical world view of a bogart had humphrey played this part we could have had a classicpace location a library and atmosphere are all good but there are a few plot holes sanders strongly fears blackmer and the ruthless organization nazis he represents yet after mistakenly killing blackmer sanders seems to experience no anxiety or remorse sanders then seizes the library and its occupants by using the ruse that he and his men are detectives investigating the murder however sanders hit man later tries to kill demming by shooting him without a silencer even though the many other detainees could have been expected to hear and become alarmed by the noise finally sanders hit man tries to kill roberts who has discovered the truth but when she faints he inexplicably does not what bothered me the most however was that the chance for a great and unexpected conclusion was wasted throughout the film patrick is portrayed as a smart hardasnails sociopath fearing nothing yet at the end she flees panicstricken from the last surviving nazi a brutish thug by the time the cops find him he has killed her and she ends up being just another weak stereotypical victim what should have happened is this the cops find the nazi thug but he is dead she has cleverly killed him and then vanished  to continue her evil ways,1
wow when i went to this film at the toronto film festival i had no idea what i was in for this movie takes you on an emotional rollercoaster in the best sense of the term sigourney weaver was better than i have seen from her in years emile hirsch was great and jeff daniels broke my heart i can see how this will not be every persons cup of tea as at times it deals with some pretty harsh things that can happen to a family do not get me wrong  it is really funny too  at my screening the audience burst out in applause after laughing over and over again i just think if you are open to examining your own life imaginary heroes will sincerely touch you i cannot wait until it comes out in theaters,1
 some spoilers this movie is sometimes subtitled life everlasting that is often taken as reference to the final scene but more accurately describes how dead and buried this onceestimable series is after this sloppy and illogical sendoffthere is a hey kids let us put on a show air about this telemovie which can be endearing in spots some fans will feel like insiders as they enjoy picking out all the various cameo appearances cowriter coproducer tom fontana and his pals pack the goingson with friends and favorites from other shows as well as real baltimore personagesthat is on top of the returns of virtually all the members of the televisions show varied casts your old favorites as well as later nonfavoritesthere was always a tugofwar pitting qualityconscious executive producer barry levinson fontana james yoshimura and the rest of the creative team against budgetconscious nbc execs who simply wanted a another moronic police procedural like nash bridges which regularly beat homicide in the ratings the pressure told as the show bounced between riveting realism that transcended its form and sleazy sensationalism that demeaned itunfortunately for this movie fontana cowriters yoshimura and eric overmeyer and director jean de segonzac simply threw in the towel they took the most ludicrous story are from the series topped it with an unlikely and artistically unfruitful new plot line and laid the burden of carrying the whole mess on one of the weaker cast membersbriefly some time has passed since the last episode of the show the former heart of baltimores homicide unit yaphet kotto as lt al giardello is now a kurt schmokelike candidate for mayor and schmoke himself makes a cameo appearance but this promising start immediately and improbably takes a tragic turnthe spotlight shifts to giancarlo esposito as giardellos son mike a handsome man who has done good work elsewhere esposito was one of the pretty faces brought in late to supposedly enliven the tv series but the question for viewers always was is mike that uncomfortable as gees son or is esposito that uncomfortable in the roleto be fair esposito does not get a chance to play out the main story without interruption that is because the writers choose this moment to revive another storyline that spat on the intelligence of the shows loyal votersan apparent snuff streaming video was promoted and then seemed to actually take place on the internet after some red herrings the detectives arrested a repellent suspect but zaljko ivaneks harassed and overworked deputy states attorney forgot to file motions in time and the suspect was released only to be murdered laterlet us summarize he forgot to file the paperwork because it was not the most sensational case of his career because the mayor the attorney general the governor the entire maryland legislature the yous attorney general nbc court tv the bbc ap reuters people the sun the washington post the new york times the la times time magazine the times of london the economist the johannesburg mail and guardian losservatore romano le figaro paris match lequipe and computer world were not calling every ten minutes to ask about the status of the casenevertheless the old gang of detectives and associates flocks back to baltimore to help out there is quite an array of talent on display unfortunately with the limited amount of dialogue to hand out some of them are merely on displaytwo of the strongest actors clark johnson and melissa leo are criminally underused while time wasted on jon seda and michael michelle could be better spent on commercials the writers do seem to satirize this presenting jason priestley as the latest bigdeal detective on the other hand they give easycome easygo michelle forbes a very affecting scenethere is some other sly casting with actual lt gary daddario the center of the book that gave rise to the show playing another detective guests drop in from other shows like whitney allen doing her deadpan and clueless miss sally from the childrens show beloved by the inmates on fontanas oz dina napoli of wbal tv turns up as herself even when entertaining though these guests can be distracting ed begley jr actually advances the story in his brief appearance playing dr victor ehrlich from fontanas st elsewhere he is still a vivid character and fits in a hospital setting then you remember did not st elegius turn out to be an autistic boys fantasythe most useful cameo reflects corporate synergy this movie was made when court tv bought rerun rights to the series that network contributed legal waif helen lucaitis who had interviewed the homicide team and later appeared on oz the tv correspondent does an efficient job summarizing the news that is plot points for latecomersalthough she is so thin that she disappears when she turns sideways lucaitis also adeptly handles a bit of physical comedy with esposito he shows more juice in his scenes with lucaitis than with any of his usual colleagues perhaps those two should have done a spinoffas the movie winds down the cream of the cast rises to the top although they are saddled with a loser script andre braugher and kyle secor overcome it their performances remind viewers what made homicide for considerable stretches the best show on the air and one of the best television productions everit is fun to watch top pros do their stuff it is just a shame this movie does not give them more of a chance diehard fans may want to see this movie anyway but you can live without it,0
deepa mehtas fire is groundbreaking bold and artistic a masterful social commentary on the plight of the women from conservative upper middle class indian households this is a film no one should miss shabana azmi and nandita das give stellar performances by underplaying their characters as much as possible ar rahmans music is the work of the genius and almost plays the role of another character in the film mehta uses rahmans score and together they create such amazing sound montages that effectively portray the views of the world around radha and sita whenever they look to each other for support this film is not about lesbianism as many have branded it lesbianism is just a part of the film it is unfortunate that most people tend to write the film off calling it taboo instead of giving it a chance and looking at its real meaning,1
bears about as much resemblance to dean koontzs novel as jessica simpson does to a rocket scientist if you have read the book i suggest you put it as far out of your mind as possible before watching the moviewatchers is your typical boy meets dog dog turns out to be superintelligent government lab experiment dog and boy are pursued by superintelligent and emotionally disturbed monster created by same lab and oh yeah did i mention the shady government agents pursuing the monster pursuing the dog moviecorey haim is the boy barbara williams is his mother michael ironside is one of the evil government guys and sandy the dog is well the dog named furface here einstein in the bookthe monster effects are ridiculously cheesy much of the dialogue is laughable the script rarely makes sense or is believable  a good example is haims characters unquestioning acceptance of the dogs intelligence as if every fido off the street can type messages on a computer keyboard or bark once for yes and twice for no hmm it is got to be the puppy chow right haims performance is enthusiastic but shaky as he carries off the stupid dialogue with the least amount of skill ironside has been the highlight of many a bad movie and this is no exception he easily gives the best performance of the movie although i am compelled to add that the dog who is a pretty darn good actor himself comes in a close secondall in all an atrociously dumb movie and yet    and yet i watched it three times within a week and yet i cannot help liking it hey what can i say i have a taste for junk  and michael ironside not that i have ever actually tasted michael ironside i am sure there are laws against that but any movie that can make me laugh that hard yes even unintentionally cannot be all bad chalk it up to a guilty pleasure a yes i know it is insultingly stupid but i like it anyway movieit is tough for me to rate this on a normal scale i am forced to give it a d but on my own personal cheese scale it gets bumped up to an ayeah i know i am weird like that,1

i have read each and every one of baroness orczys scarlet pimpernel books counting this one i have seen three pimpernel movies the one with jane seymour and anthony andrews i preferred greatly to this it goes out of its way for violence and action occasionally completely violating the spirit of the book i do not expect movies to stick directly to plots i gave up being that idealistic long ago but if an excellent movie of a book has already been made do not remake it with a tv movie that includes excellent actors and nice costumes but a barely decent script sticking with the eightys versionrahne,0
this film was a mexican made horror film from the late sixtys it is not that good but really not so bad either there is plenty of schlock and it is padded pretty heavily with nudity and violence but it had a plot and at least tried to keep to it even if the plot was the same damn frankenstein inspired do not tamper in gods domain bmovie fare there was some padding mixed in with the female wrestling but it was made in mexico and wrestling does seem to be popular in mexicothe plot is that a doctor wants to save his son who is dying from leukemia the other doctors have given no hope for the poor guy but dad has the idea of transplanting a gorillas heart for his sons to save his life i do not know i am a lawyer not a doctor the transplant works but sonnyboy ends up becoming a manape who terrorizes nude women and kills anyone who gets in his path there is also a subplot involving a cop and his girlfriend who is a wrestler this really did not add too much but if they wanted to throw in some masked female wrestlers here is a good reason to do sothe film was kind of cheap but not too bad for a bmovie of the day the plot was basically just recycled and there were a few things that were not tied in that well however this film is kind of fun in its own way i do not know why maybe because it is a mexican horror film and sticks out in my normal bad movie diet i guess it may be because it is a mix and mash of some very weird thingswatch it if you like cheesy foreign films nudity and female wrestlers,0

johnny crawford is great in this movie of a troubled teen coming of age in a generation that was in the middle of a cultural and spiritual upheaval billy graham does a good job of portraying life in this sweet sometimes corny but all the way sincere flick he gives us a look at not only the social scene but gives good solid advice that holds true today about morals decisions the generation gap teen dating some of the statistics that are given in this movie are astounding they sound like todays stats just to see billy in his younger days is worth seeing it is an awesome movie it made me realize that human nature does not change even though hair fashion and language may change humans are still struggling with the same issues they have been struggling with for thousands of years,1
okths film like segals last few films once again goes beyond the knock them down kick them in the groin shoot them in the face get revenge against the bad guys for hurting my sisters nieces cousin stuff seagal was into for a while geepers steven started thinking and using his bucks to make movies with actual ideas in them surethere is plenty of action in this flick but also some thought and heart it is not an oscar flick but well worth the effort unless the viewer is so into brain dead violence that it hurts to have to think for longer than a second it is worth a rentalor two,1

finally third time lucky this film has been always been on my mind but my first viewing i forgot about it and only caught the second half of the film then only a couple months later i had the my second chance of watching of it so i decided i would record it only to discover that my timer went off late and again i missed the first half of the flick i was not going to allow that to happen again so when it came on tv again i thought bugger it i will wait until it comes on then i will record it and it was a good choice i would have just watched the film but they always put on weeknights around midnight after discovering a hole in their crowded cell nine prisoners escape their confinement to track down the key of the universe which a fellow prisoner known as the counterfeit king said he had hidden they think that this key could be an opening for a hidden loot of counterfeit bills on this journey they naturally see this as an opportunity to pick up their lives before they were gaoled although things do not turn out the way that they intended to with most of the criminals plans going astray nine souls is an perky spiritual journey from japanese director toshiaki toyada which flung it is viewers into a film of two totally different halves the first half of the story plays out more like a psychical comedy with the criminals bonds and the situations they find themselves being the selling point but all that makes way to a moralistic and consequence dramapacked second half where the real trouble begins with some quite nasty and bloody moments replacing the goofball tone it started off with while the first half is quite amusing with its on the road screwball doodling and offbeat banter but it is really the genuinely haunting latter half with it is peculiar turn of events that hit you so hard with some surprising touches that make you really sympathise for these very human characters even though they are not truly innocent from their crimes you just become entrenched by these fleshout characters in the first half that when you see them spiral into their downfall you know it is an effective drama when you become she willshocked in the dramatic change the nine characters get enough screen time to truly understand their personal story and what weakness would eventually bring them down the way the plot works out is that michiru and torakichi are the lead characters and we mostly see it from their perspectives the escapism tale is an unquestionably engaging character study that is clear in it is goal and puts to you many questions on society and the path you choice to take to escape life and free yourself from these restraints while the symbolic story is full of clarity and vividly told the visual element does not go by unnoticed because there is just a dreamy and trancelike vibe that channels itself into the unique atmosphere what highly contributed to that factor and gave the film a lift was the sweepingly moody instrumental rock soundtrack the mellow atmospheric gel it was able to create in many scenes left me rather breathless with the everlasting emotions it was able to provoke simply beautiful and downright powerful control on that front the pacing for such an long film  two hours  seems to breeze by and editing is swiftly done because we are just so wrapped up in it all the hypnotic photography is crisp in detail while the performances by the cast as a odd bunch of criminals are that of high quality with each one providing enough personality and features to separate themselves i found nine souls to be a pleasing and quite an amazing surreal film that stirs up the emotions and then it smacks you with an almighty wallop when it changes direction highly recommended,1
this is not a good movie it is a tried remake of the english movie the hitch but it insults the original one this is hardly a movie you expect from a veteran director like david dhawan who is credited to directing good movies like raja babu coolie noone hero no onethe main theme for this movie is taken from the hitch with some changes so as to appeal to the indian audience but somehow the story and the screenplay is not convincing enough plus the acting from the lead roles ie salman khan and govinda is pitiful it seems that they need the slightest provocation to remove their shirts to reveal their bare chest i do not consider this fascinating and least of all comic what was the director thinking  added to this the viewers have to bear the case of govindas overacting it was simply unbearable i advise the viewers to watch it at your own risk my rating of two for this movie could be considered to be a very generous oneinstead i would advise the viewers to watch the english movie hitch which is a lot better,0

a woman in love with her husband he is suicidal decides to have a baby to save his life she is been to a fertility clinic  as has the lover she takes  so both know how artificial insemination works but instead of using the method thousands of people use every year around the world the five turkey baster they engage in coitus we also are to believe that although the immigrant is in love with his fiancée he does not suggest the obvious alternative to intercourse further even though this is a business arrangement the first time she is with her sperm donor she takes off all her clothes as if it is a seduction plus her husband does not notice when thirtyzero goes missing from their bank accounts does all this seem to demand more willing suspension of disbelief than even most hollywood fare far fetched on all counts,0

i was at the premier of the movie last night in rome i am not an expert in the book however there are a great deal of changes from the book to the movie the pacing of this movie is much faster than the davinci code many things were trimmed otherwise this would be a four hour movie many things were also changed to give the movie a fast pace i think what matters is the feel of the movie and that works well for hanks brown and companythere are some things in the book that would appear very implausible in the movie form i am not giving any spoilers except to say the ending of the movie is handled in a slightly different way how leonardo vetra was found is also different those who see the movie might be interested in reading the book to get the full details of the story some minor details are are also cut from the moviealthough they did film in rome they had to recreate interior shots since i went on a walking tour of rome the day before the movie i can say that the interior sites are authentic in look and feel kohler is not in the movie and not much is shown about cern hanks does a good job and there are some interesting scenes involving the vatican archives of course they had no access to that area and i am not sure if anyone actually knows what the vatican archives look like eyelet zurer has her break in this movie as victoria vetra and does a good job as eye candy for hanksthis movie should be received better by the critics and public but you never know ron howard mentioned several times in interviews and as we saw him and the cast before the movie that this is just a movie,1
lights of new york originally started out as an experimental two reel vitaphone short that eventually snowballed into the first all talkie feature film helene costelle was supposedly one of the most beautiful actresses in hollywood and sister to in my opinion the real beauty dolores costello who seemed to get all the breaks poor helene is best known for appearing in this pretty dreary film that bought a revolution to hollywoodtwo bootleggers on the lam in main street convince a couple of small town barbers to try their luck on broadway the barbers eddie cullen landis and gene eugene palette do not realise that their barber shop is soon a cover for illegal bootlegging activities they soon do realise it and regret the day they left their small town the only thing keeping them going is the loan that eddies mother gave them and that they desperately want to pay back eddie becomes reacquainted with kitty lewis helene costello a girl from his home town who has made good on broadway kitty is worried about hawk miller wheeler oakman who is always hanging around her but eddie innocently thinks she is exaggerating as hawk already has a girlfriend molly gladys brockwell but to reassure her he gives her a little handgun to frighten unwanted admirers away hawk who has killed a police officer and has the feds closing in decides to frame eddie meanwhile molly is getting pretty fed up with hawks treatment of her and after a showdown where he tells her he is after a chicken and not an old hen the stage is set for  murderthe fact is it is not completely awful apart from gangsters and showgirls alike speaking in their best elocution voices and that was still happening in films in one thousand nine hundred and thirty gladys brockwell if a trifle melodramatic and eugene palette quite natural were okay and were the most seasoned actors in the cast there was no john or ethel barrymore to be seen  cullen landis and helene costello soon returned to the obscurity from which they had come i also did not notice much of the hidden mike  where people had to be grouped around different objects ie a telephone or sitting on a couch before they could engage in conversation people who saw it at the cinema probably started to think that all policeman talked in that flat monotone as that trend continued in many early talkies ie little caesar one thousand nine hundred and thirty in any case they were probably intrigued by the novelty of a completely all talkie  with some singing and dancing  film in one thousand nine hundred and twentyeightrecommended,1
heath ledgers acting in this film really bugs me but overall its a great watch bryan brown is excellent when i do not normally like him but then his whole gang are a great piece of work jimmy is a hapless wannabe gangster who cannot seem to do a thing right spoilers loses pandos money ackos car and nearly bumbles a bank robbery but still comes out on topdid not know what the two kids were in it for at the start but they ties some storylines together nicelyall in all a damn fine piece of australian cinema nineten,1
i have read several reviews that ask the question why was this film made i myself found that question looming in my mind as the hour and twenty minute feature seemed to drag near the middle only to give off the sensation that it was picking up steam at the end when in actuality it was doing nothing of the sort so why was this film made i think that is a great question for those watching heftig og begeistret to ask themselves this reviewer is proud of director knut erik jensen for giving us this powerful image of hope brotherhood and inspiration with this all male choir but i do not think that jensen did enough to bring a gripping story to the table let me pose this question to you do audience members need more in a documentary than just a straight forward story to maintain interest my answer is yes and this is where jensen failed heftig og begeistret was a good documentary but it was far from great jensen did a horrible job with the story and dedication of the subjects it was great to hear the songs but over time those songs seemed dull overwhelming and a bit precocious from the opening scene where our men are singing their hearts out in a blinding snow i knew that i was hooked but as the film developed i lost interest why jensen never took us the audience members to the next level he kept the playing field level and ultimately hurt the overall tone of the film was this a movie about the music or about the men in the choir the world may never knowagain i would like to state that jensen did a phenomenal job of finding an interesting story about this group of men who have definitely seen hard times and how they coped with that through music but it was as if the all male choir were a bunch of the most boring men ever created jensen gave us the music superbly but it was the characters the subjects that i knew nothing about by the end of the film in the mix we had a ninetyseven year old man who still had his drivers license we had a large man in a tub singing classic american songs we had old men who were once heartthrobs in their youth we had some tension between the youth of the choir and the veteran singers and we even had an exdrug addict that had only been clean for eleven years did jensen develop these interesting stories at all nope he left them on the table it was obvious that these singers were willing to talk further about it see the political man who missed his political days but jensen seemed to clear away from those heartfelt moments and head straight back into interesting places that he could have the choir sing to me the music was defined at the beginning of the film i wanted to be introduced and hear the stories of these individual men they were all captivating yet jensen seemed to ignore them completelyby ignoring the major subjects of this documentary jensen became unsuccessful in creating any sort of tension towards the end without giving the ending away i felt like jensen was coloring in the lines instead of being bold outside the lines he chose to create no moment of sympathy emotion nervousness or sadness jensen took our subjects from point a to point b to point c without asking us to become involved in any way shape or form i can see how national sentiment had made this film into a huge success in norway but for everyone else watching ie me more was necessarily needed i wanted to feel for these guys i wanted to know if they were going to do well as they traveled or just find themselves loved in their own city there was no story mostly in part to no development of the subjects when you watch modern documentaries oddly this film was made in two thousand and one you want it to play out similar to any hollywood feature film you want suspense realism and drama alas with heftig og begeistret you get nothing of the sortoverall i must ask the question again why was this film made my final answer alex is that jensen wanted to show how troubling times and a changing economy can still produce happiness in even the coldest places of earth i think that jensen wanted to show human dedication and how something as simple as singing can unite a population with that said jensen demonstrated that perfectly in this film but he did not create a good documentary when you make a film of this nature i feel that you must look within the group examine the choir participants and hear each one of their stories to bring about an ending that will grip your heart the only thing that this film gripped was my attention span as it attempted to leave the room at rocket speed again i do not want to sound negative about this film because the music was excellent and the men singing did bring about a feeling of honesty but i needed more with documentaries becoming a bigger staple of the film community one expects a bit more than what heftig og begeistret handed to us i want to see reality and people not just another song and dance routine grade  out of ,0
let me break down this film for youthe first fifteen minutes are a showcase for terrible special effects i am not one to nitpick about special effects but what you have got to understand is that if you cannot afford good special effects you should not anchor your film around special effects starships fire blobs of color at each other flaring into stock explosions and careening past moons with polygon counts low enough to count with your fingers you will have no idea what is happening it will not make sensethe second act involves a woman walking in the desert at this point you will be treated to drab scenery and illogical boring fight scenes nobody speaks nothing interesting happens the protagonists goals are unclear and are not very compelling this goes on for about fortyfive minutesthen in a fiveminute montage she sneaks into an enemy base straps herself to a rocket tries to destroy a doomsday weapon fails and diesnone of this has any bearing on the eventual direction of the filmin the last twenty minutes basically the chicks memories get transferred to her daughter who goes into stasis for a very large number of years learning the secrets of mankind after this we see the first and last fiveminute segment of human interaction in the film then the new heroine is forced to choose whether she wants to become part of the material that causes the big bang or not you know because when the universe is collapsing you get to decide if you want to be a part of itshe chooses yes but the memories of mankind survive in a capsule maybe we will not make the same mistakes again huh if you like movies with characters then this is not a good movie for you the lead roles could have been fulfilled nicely by any old windup toy capable of staying rightsideup while walking through sand all of the story is told through painfully dull narrationthe film tries to seem deep by throwing together a whole bunch of undeveloped sciencefiction ideas there are enough concepts here to fuel a number of films but as it stands it is bloated with completely irrelevant details twothirds of this film could have been reduced to a fortyfivesecond montage instead the narrator fills in a novellas worth of backstory without ever giving us a reason to care what happens to the charactersthere are good ideas in here but nobody watches films to see ideas ineptly explained people watched films to be entertained this film does not entertain,0
this film is brilliant it has cute little dolphins in it and its a great storyline and it has elijah wood in it which makes it a great film too his acting skills are very good and if you want a good soft family film this is the one to watch,1
do not listen to what the critics have always said about this cute charming little movie madonna is great in this clever comedy i worked at a video store for several years and suggested this movie to lots of customers no one ever brought it back and screamed at me for telling them to rent it everyone always enjoyed it it is actually a great movie for kids too,1
i thought it will be a ok movie after seeing the commercials about it it was funny at some parts and some very nasty the only person i felt sorry for is horatio sans who got a hot wife who is cheating on him with other women but he never got a chance to have a threesome with until the and that was good but they should have made more bigger thru out the film,0
ukborn australian helmer alex frayne calls for attention with his strange necessitating a meticulous read visually stunning modern love two thousand and six following the steps of a man incapable of controlling a drastic personality change spurred by the death of a close relative pic offers a fascinating examination of human psychology distributed by accent filmaustraliajohn mark constable his wife emily victoria hill and their son edward william traeger arrive in a small southern town to take care of his deceased uncles don barker property while emily and edward check into a local hotel john begins to question the locals about uncle toms death  some say that he committed suicide some are unwilling to talk puzzled john comes up with a theory of his own  uncle tom is alive and well hiding in the nearby bushesif not for the occasional lines of dialog used to ease its heavy atmospheric tone modern love could have been easily mistaken for a sokurov film shot with a sixteenmm camera its washedout color scheme is strangely evocative of the russian directors reflective forays into human agony perhaps it is not a coincidence that it was at the moscow international film festival where modern love had its premierelooking under the surface of this unique collage of intoxicating visuals however reveals a slightly different picture  while sokurovs films tend to remain painfully intimate to a point where they intentionally detach the main protagonists from the surrounding environment by blurring everything into a large splash of the directors preferred yellow modern love very much feeds off the australian countryside johns gradual psychological transformation is dependent on it and the more the story progresses the more it becomes obvious that nature was an integral part of fraynes visionin sokurovs the second circle a young man returns to the russian countryside to bury his deceased father in the shack where the old man once lived everything is covered with dust he gathers the few old clothes scattered around and places the body of his father in a coffin then he bids goodbye and buries it the rest of the film is a prolonged reflection on the collapse of the soviet system the loneliness and dissatisfaction many were left dealing within modern love somewhat ironically love is nowhere to be seen on the contrary it is pain loneliness and dissatisfaction with modernity that suddenly invade johns life unlike the second circle however here the main protagonist has the opportunity to reembrace his modern life his wife and son await him yet he walks away slowly but surely the present begins to disintegrate under the weight of a somewhat confusing pasti doubt frayne intended for modern love to be so strikingly similar to what sokurov did in the second circle yet the pacing and in particular the puzzling framing are precisely what transforms this film into a near meditative experience  a difficult and enormously brittle approach to deconstructing human psychology the two directors have mastered to perfectionmark constable delivers a topnotch performance as john adding even greater depth to his highly challenging character his facial expressions are outstanding both victoria hill and william traeger match perfectly with their performances pics tense visual style,1
before seeing this film i suggest the viewer puts away any expectations that the victims of the crimes depicted will get equal treatment and consideration as the perpetrator there have been many films about crime victims this one is about the murdererdead man walking finds realism in simplicity of the story there are no crack lawyers coming to save william poncelet and no dramatic story twists the film does not attempt to put him in a good light he is guilty he is repugnant is a racist and was responsible for heinous murders given all this we are asked to do something very difficult look at him as a human being despite his crimes in this way the film challenges the notion that the death penalty provides justice whether you are for or against the death penalty the film raises questions about whether the guilty can find redemption inequity in the justice system and the appropriateness of the death penaltygreat performances by both susan sarandon and sean penn in particular the last moments of the film show the true depth of penns ability,1
get smart should be titled get stupid there is not one funny line or gag in the entire film this film is so bad it makes the austin powers films look shakespearean a few more films like this and steve carell can kiss his career goodbye as for anne hathaway what is she doing in this film she is a good actress but is just plain terriblethe writing is pathetically lame there is not one funny clever or witty line there is not one good sight gagthe directing is terrible comedy relies on timing someone should tell the director that every line that is supposed to be funny and is not is delivered with absolutely the worst sense of comic timing i have ever seenzero stars,0
this is a cute little french silent comedy about a man who bets another that he cannot stay in this castle for one hour due to its being haunted and once the guy enters the house it looks much more like a crazed fun house or maybe like the aftereffects of lsd while there are ghosts and skeletons there is a weird menagerie of animals odd special effects and gags as well it is awfully hard to describe but the visuals alone make the film worth seeing however understand that the selfindulgent director also had many funny gags that totally fell flat and hurt the movie his camera tricks were not so much tricky but annoying and stupid ignore these and keep watchingit does get better the film is fast paced funny and worth seeing in particular i really liked watching the acting and mugging of max linderhe was so expressive and funny too bad he is virtually forgotten today for an interesting but very sad read check out the imdb biography on him,1
first off i just want to say that this show could have done well way better than it is doing now what brought it down was certainly the acting miranda cosgrove who acts as the main character carly looked almost worthy of her own show when she was on drake and josh unfortunately icarly was a big let down not only can miranda not act convincingly enough but she is incredibly stiff when she moves she looks as if she is not sure how the character carly would move or stand in the very first episode at the end when she throws the hat up her arm does not ever leave her side from her elbow up even when she was dancing she looked like a stick in the breeze and the singing the theme song was great only because drake had been in it the music was pretty good and mirandas voice sounded fake i have to admit the plot and settings are good unrealistic but hey that is nick they are practically known for stupid lines and characters but wow is icarly the worst of them all,0
tenchi muyo in love two is the third tenchi movie it seemed that its creators took elements from the first two to make this one at the risk of giving out spoilers tenchi is kidnapped and the team has to get him back nothing new there a past love of yoshos is the bad guy that was done in the second movie the battle between aeka and ryoko and is starting to get boring the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy i personally do not know what aic it is makers were thinking i gave this movie a vote of four,0
black dragons is a second feature wwii propaganda film popular at the time it is not as bad as some would have you believe a secret meeting hosted by the respected dr william saunders george pembrokeis interrupted by a mysterious stranger names monsieur colomb bela lugosi shortly thereafter the participants at the meeting begin to turn up murdered their bodies being placed on the steps of the japanese embassy in washington colomb is suspected federal agent dick martin clayton moore is assigned to the case and meets saunders niece alice saunders joan barclay who tries to assist him the reasons behind colombs actions are not explained until the final reel until all is explained at the end the story is hard to comprehend  lugosi who had by this time been reduced to appearing in a string of low budget quickies is actually quite good in this one he is not allowed to over act as much as he ususlly did and credit for this has to go to director william nigh lugosis character slinks through the shadows and is reminiscent of his dracula even to the point of the full close ups of his piercing eyes clayton moore a one dimensional actor at best would become tvs lone ranger in a few years joan barclay makes a good heroine although a little dated now black dragons is not a bad way to spend an hour,0
wagon master is a very unique film amongst john fords work mainly because it is the only one that is based on a story written by john ford himself the story that was elaborated by frank nugent and directors son  patrick ford and turned into a screenplay and because of directors personal opinion regarding it wagon master is the film john ford called the one which came closest to being what i had wanted to achieve to say so is not to say a little but as ford confessed once to lindsay anderson his favourite was nonetheless my darling clementine and not any other wagon master has all ingredients one might expect to find in a john fords film wonderful cast delivering his best thou not featuring any major stars except the most fordian of all actors  ben johnson very peculiar small characters who provide an obligatory comic relief and wagon master has quite a few of them such as horn blowing sister ledyard jane darwell in her shot but very inspired gigs and last but not least legendary monument valley with john fords fifth passage through it after stagecoach my darling clementine fort apache and she wore a yellow ribbon the film starts with two friends cowboys travis blue ben johnson and sandy owens harry carey jr being hired to be wagon masters or guides for a caravan of mormon settlers who are headed to silver valley a place that is for them like a promised land on their way they are joined by a very peculiar dr locksley hall alan mowbray with two beautiful women who are supposedly his wife and daughter and who call themselves actors they are headed in the same direction simply because they were recently driven out of the nearest town and have no other place to go nothing particularly unpleasant happens till they bump into cleggs a dangerous family gang consisting of father and his three sons who are on the run from the marshal of the town where they recently committed murder and bank robbery overall wagon master is no more nor less than one more precious pearl in a necklace of john fords wonderful westerns a must see nineten,1
in this film gary oldman plays a defense attorney who was formerly a prosecutor he is a bit tormented but is more or less playing a regular guy rather than some sort of figurative or literal monster funny thing is he does not quite pull it off i guess you cannot quite get to normal from there kevin bacon was sufficiently creepy the scene in the park was way too long with way too many false scares and the odd sex scene with oldman and karen young seemed to have come from a different movie although the rest of the time miss young did just fine this film suffers from oddness trying to cover up the predictability and failing do not bother,0
was this supposed to be funny this is one of those films that just does not work the first one bruce almighty with jim carey had some very funny moments this one had nonesteve carrell who was brilliant in bruce almighty fails to deliver here his performance is very ordinary and he cannot carry it off like carey didthe one good thing about this is i only paid oneninetyfive to rent it it is a movie for childrenvery young children who have only seen about four films or so in their short livesit is interesting to note that where jim carey stars in a film and they make a sequel without him that it is usually a huge turkey anyone remember son of mask imdb worst one hundred films of all time avoid this one movie lovers,0
it is a shame barry humphries infamous sir les patterson character had it is film debut in this under cooked spycomedythis film reminded me of the beattyhoffman stinker ishtar one thousand nine hundred and eightyseven humphries should have learned from the mistakes that film made  if your going to change gears on a concept do not use spies like ishtar the first twenty minutes or so offer a promise of something different it would have been great to see the anachronistic and boorish patterson sleazing around in the world of australian politics one of characters even point out that patterson is of date with the current times  you would think humphires could of had a field day making commentary on the hawke government i can just picture a scene with patterson and hawkie in a drinking contest but instead of a film that might of been clever and even a biting look into that world we get patterson running around the world as james bond trying to save the world from biochemical weapons that runs out of steam before the half way markdisappointing,0
i really hoped for the best with this one but it just did not happen financed at a very nondutch manner and still looking great with a style and pace that is very much like hollywood what i do not understand is howwith all these great benefits the directorwriterproducer still managed to make this film a completely horrible picture to watch filled with bad jokes cheap nudity and actors that just cannot really talk act in the english language kudos for pulling it off but what was this guy thinking,0
i would say to the foreign people who have seen this movie and who did not understand it that it is normal because it was based on massive plays on words a person not knowing about the french cultural funny references in this film could not follow all the subtleties the movie has been a huge success in france and all the actors are well renowned here,1
this movie was absolutely one of the worst movies i have ever seen the plot could have been made to work had the movie been written better the acting was some of the worst i have ever seen i was very slow and made me want to leaveturn off the movie several times i watched the entire movie in the hopes that the ending would make it worthwhile but it did not this movie i think should be rated in the negative numbers in my humble opinion,0
onest watched twoeighteentwo thousand and seven  four out of tendirleon leonard fair adventure movie based on a novel by the author of moby dick fame herman melville this movie is about the captain of a ship who had stolen the eyesthat were extremely rare black pearls from a native tribes god sculpture and hidden them somewhere that only he knew about before leaving the island of tivi he got very sick and was on a secret voyage to go back to the island to retrieve the pearls for himself while otherslike his daughter thought that he was going back to be treated by the local medicine man others did not know the reason for the voyage a stowaway actually knew the real reason for the trip  to return the eyes to their god the silly part is that the pearls were hidden very close to the statue and all this time the natives ran their tribe without their god having eyescausing them all kinds of problems along the way we are treatedfor some reason to a short underwater nature show with an electric eel fighting a local octopusi guess only herman melville knows what this was all about once they get to the island the captain dies but passes the whereabouts of the pearls to his daughter but she also gets the sickness curse as well one of the bad guys finds out where the god is housed and convinces the daughter to go there and steal back the pearls but at this point the good guys find out what is going on and a fight ensues i will not tell you the results of the fight or the ending i will leave that up to you to find out if you want as i said earlier the movie was ok but some very silly things that i have already mentioned lessened it is impact i wonder if that new pirates of the caribbean got some of it is plot from this one hmm black pearls a curse i wonder well it does not matter those elements did not make for a very good movie in this case or the other it seems they would learn they are lesson but with the money rolling in on that newer movie i am sure they will not oh well,0
this is a great horror movie great plot and a person with a fear of midgets will definately love the evil midget this is a must see for any horror fan finally a lower budget movie with decent effects and a great cast highly recommended,1

having just borrowing the series one dvd collection from my somewhat obsessive brother i was expecting to get through the first couple of episodes and handing it back i have just found myself yelling at the screen for ending the first season on a cliffhanger  a mere week later and i have watched the entire season where i found the time for this i have no ideathis show is great it does not take itself too seriously it has likeable characters who are well acted and the special effects ignoring the odd tacky puppet here and there are special enough to give it that polished feel at first i did not realise it was filmed mostly here and it seemed odd to hear so many aussie accents on a scifi show  it was most amusing for the main character john to land back in sydney midway through the first seasoni believe this shows biggest strength is the vision that the creators of the show obviously had they have gradually introduced new aspects of the characters that have explain previous actions and the continue to smatter johns conversations with slang in an amusing and unforced way on top of that having watched the entire voyager and next gen series i see little plot ripoff  so it has managed to maintain a sense of originality throughout the entire first season i hope the rest of it is as goodfarscape is not like any other scifi that i have enjoyed in the past i heard that the fourth season was not as good as the first three and i am now quite annoyed that they cancelled it before the fiveth i hope that they revive this show  with the same actors in either a movie or another series it would be a shame to leave so many plot lines unfinished as i imagine that with a show that is had so much thought put into it to have it axed without adequate warning will leave me feeling robbedgot to go now heading back to my brothers place to snaffle the twond seasonv,1
steve martin looks like he is had a face lift something very strange about his face i usually like anything steve does but this movie comes off as trashy not funny did not think charlene encouraging him to be rough with his wife was a good message to be sending out to teens watching this film,0
i was not sure where this was headed until the ending when it turned out that this was all a liberal conspiracy to hand the world over to european wimps and the united nations what a load of rightwing crud incidentally the bit about canada joining the us did not really have much to do with the plot at all and the idea was never developed the only point of it seems to be that it made the main character eligible to run for presidentbut they could have just made him american and dispensed with that in any event this was a load of bull and not worth your time if you want to see this kind of thing done well check out the brilliant bbc political thriller state of play,0

okay to be fair this movie did have an interesting concept given a few script rewrites some decent actors and a budget this might have been a fairly decent cult flick instead of the mstthreek fodder it turned out to bestill it was better than armageddon,0
this short was director del lords last and only shemp short the problem it was quite weak and the cafe scene was pretty much a carbon copy of a curly short busy buddies one thousand nine hundred and fortyfour the interrogation scene was pretty funny and the beginning part of the cafe part but there are a lot of plotholes in this short for example why are the stooges hiding in the garbage can when the police come in the remake of cash and hashone thousand nine hundred and fiftyfive director jules white fixes this and the reason for the stooges hiding in the garbage can is because there is a gunfight between the police and the armored car robbers the scene in which moe is having trouble with the oyster was done before with curly in dutiful but dumb one thousand nine hundred and fortyone the spooky house part was not all that great except for the hilarious scene on the outside of the spooky house to top it off the ending had no sting to it rating c,0
i have not laughed so much in a theater in years the only problem is that it was not the intent of the movie to make my throat raw from laughterthis movie is absolutely overflowing with bad cgi absolutely terrible duologue absolutely terrible acting and enough geek references to make the whole thing come off as nothing but complete cheeseas a gamer and a geektype girl myself i did recognize all of the obvious game references in this movie as well as the geek stuff that was just thrown into the background as eye candy the steamboy poster the tshirts from thinkgeekcom and jlistcom and that did not redeem the movie at allthe only thing that might have been good at all were the ghost children type characters that were purposefully badly done in cgi to make it look like they were from a game and who were obviously stolen from japanese horror moviesto be honest it was hilariously bad and something i would expect from a midnight showing of a madefortv b grade scifi channel movie do not expect more than that and you will have a great time just do not get a soda or you will spit it everywhere when you get great lines like why did you bring that game into our lives why,0
there is a serious scene in this movie a scene that let us you know that his film will not be pulling many cheap punches it takes place in a crowded train station and the protagonists are ambushed by assassins with automatic weapons they make a break for it and just manage to get out in a hail of gunfire the main hall of the train station is now filled with corpses of innocent people that were caught in the crossfire some would call that too sad andor grim to put into what is supposed to be an enjoyable action flick i call it honesty most action movies tend to lean toward the safe side of showing violence and plot elements this mostly means that in spite massive shootouts innocent people tend not to die or at least we do not see them die the violence is all purely the good guys versus the bad guys with mainly the bad guys dying a bit of common sense clearly shows this to be absurdrenny harlin showed a hint of this in his first and sadly only hit die hard two the villains intentionally crash a plane full of people to get their point across the scene was also filmed with a backup scene of a cargo plane with only a few people onboard going down but the grimmer and probably more realistic scenario ended up being used however to fit the spirit of the first film die hard two was mostly a fun action movie here that grimmer and more convincing edge is pervasive the violence is bloody the one liners are hilarious but with a certain style that more echoes natural human sarcasm than clichéd film wisecracks at key moments of action the plot is also packed with more malicious intent than most action films the villain is not just some rogue out for revenge or a mad grab at power it is less ridiculous but also more frightening than that from recent films the bourne trilogy almost gets there with its less cheesy than usual action film style but this film is from one thousand nine hundred and ninetysix and seven years before the bourne identity with matt damon made it to the big screenanother interesting aspect is that the main hero is actually a heroine and this is well before the movie version of tomb raider became a hit what is more is that this heroine genuinely looks like she could take down john mcclane and then take his still lit cigarette this movie marks geena daviss second actionheroine role and she still did not manage to score a hit while angelina jolie stars in tomb raider years later and scores a hit the reasons are beyond me completelylastly this movie is not all dark edged there are many outrageous and spectacular set pieces that one can only see in an action film the climatic explosion of a chemical bomb is an absolutely spectacular display of movie pyrotechnics with more than one law of physics taking a convenient break thus there is formula here but it is the antiformula for the everyday hollywood action movie formula  ninetenbscdb classification thirteen  violence profanity,1
everyone knows that lindburgh succeeded in the first transatlantic flight so how can there be any suspense or intrigue in this film well there is do not ask me how but there is partly due to the directors expert telling of the tale but mostly due to jimmy stewarts thoroughly engaging performance we are drawn into the story as if it were unfolding for the first time right before our eyes despite the fact that half the movie is filmed in a cramped cockpit it is as dynamic as any action flick out there so if you are apprehensive about seeing this movie because you think you know the story already give it a shot i think you will be impressed,1
the director seems like a good solid man his parents struggle with the same issues we all cope with they strayed from each other they loved each other they misunderstood each other and the poor audience has to sit through ninety minutes of what is possibly the trials and tribulations of one of the most boring families ever to come out of long islandthere are few interesting choices in this documentarythe music is banal the filming uninspired and the story is the same story that has played out on every birch street in every town in america i do not mean to sound too harshseldom has a sweeter more wellintentioned documentary been made the director is the kind of man with whom you would want to be friends you just wish he had struggled as much presenting the material as his parents did keeping their marriage alive,0
i waited a long time to finally see what i thought was going to be a fun caper flick and was shocked to discover shoddy direction awkward dialogue a lackluster pace unmotivated slapstick gags and an overall coarseness that permeated the film throughout just not funny the sets looked cheap the costumes by the usually excellent donfeld are garish and distracting even the title song is annoying the whole childrens book characters does not come close to representing the married couple whose life is turned upside down when he loses his job for a film that seems to aim a dart at the unfairness of welfare and unemployment systems the filmmakers have no problem in being unfair themselves allowing hispanic black and gay stereotypes played at such a cruel level the look of the film resembles any episode of love american style this is not a compliment tacky seventies fashions abound in this world of white collar theft that only lends an air of implausibility to every situation outside of a clever initial idea and two capable stars in jane fonda and george segal this dated exercise in social commentary comes off as forced and mean spirited to minorities especially to gay people if you want a better caper film you are better off with the hot rock with george segal and robert redford or what is up doc with ryan oneal and barbra streisand now that is funny,0
do not get me wrong i love the tv series of league of gentlemen it was funny twisted and completely inspired i was looking forward to the movie the premise was interesting and i looked forward to see what they had done with the characters and where the bizarre storyline would take themit was a total disappointment for starters the three weakest characters in the series were the leads and it only contained bit parts for the other characters why not pick mickey  pauline papa lazaro or tubs and edward for the main parts it was unfunny throughout half baked gags and poor slapstick humourthe real clincher was the plain ridiculous period drama  comedy and i will use the word comedy loosely it distracted from the main storyline and felt awkward not to mention painfully unfunny the direction of the movie is appalling and often feels that the lines were delivered by the characters within one take very rushedthen  the three headed plasticineesquire monster what the hell was all that about plain ridiculous it felt like the league of gentlemen tagged it on at the endall in all i found myself looking at my watch and sighing with disappointment throughout my experience of the film what was once an amazing television series has been tainted by a terribly unfunny film if i could give it zero out of ten i would do not waste your money seeing this,0
i saw this movie with my mother and i loved it it was such a sweet story not to mention funny because of the supporting cast they never make movies like thisever my favorite part is when graceminnie driver finds out about her boyfriends wifes death and that she has the deceased wifes heart and she screams what was god thinking i do believe everyoneno matter who you believe in has thoughts like that once in awhile but while it is very sappy it just might make you believe in true love and destiny for once and for allsighthe comedic timing between bonnie hunt and jim belushi will just make you crack upespecially in the aforementioned scene it is terrible and yet so funny they make a good pair and i hope to see them again in something soon tenten stars,1
chris smiths american movie is an insightful examination of the american dream the movie focuses around mark borchardt an independent film maker from wisconsin mark has dreamed of becoming a great writer and director since he was a teenager and had an out of focus hieight camera the movie follows mark through his attempt to make his dream feature film northwestern there are a number of hilarious scenes in the film as mark goes through preproduction of northwestern and later his short film coven pronounced coven the correct pronunciation mark says sounds too much like oven which he plans to use to raise money to complete northwestern this films insight and humor is on par with roger and me michael moores great film i first viewed it at a chaotic sundance film festival screening that brought out the spirit of the movie a giant air duct fell from the ceiling at the beginning of the movie hit seven people and caused a twentyfive minute delay half way through the film the sound started fluttering and the projector had to be stopped to fix it and in the last twenty minutes the projector stopped and the film burned up despite the delays the audience stayed through the movie and gave it a standing ovation american movie also won the grand jury prize for documentary at the end of the festival i highly recommend this fine film worth sitting through any hellish screening,1
ok i watched this movie someone needs to kick me why must the olsen twins insist on subjecting the world to this putrid torture this was another movie of watching the olsen twins travel to an exotic location meet some cute guyslook pretty and have everyone drooling over themthe directionthe plot developmentugh the acting i do not know about the yous but in my country it is considered extremely stupid to hop onto the bike of a guy you met liketen minutes back though i am now convinced that these girls will never learn to act i really hope that one day we will get to watch a movie with an originaleven slightly plausible plot,0
gordon scott made some good tarzan movies but this is not one of themas i watched it wincing at the bad obviously interior sets and the hollow wooden clonking sounds as they walked across supposedly dirt trails and cringing at the bad dialog and worse acting among the supporting cast i kept thinking sheesh this is tv show level then i find out it was indeed three tv show pilot episodes woven seamfully into oneit is nice to see scott get outside alone away from the lame sets in a few of the scenes and the fights do have some pretty nice moves but oh ow and ouch as to the dialog and did i mention the acting heck cheetah or cheta in this version was a better actor than most of the humansand that is not saying muchit is kind of a stitch to see a younger sherman ie scatman carothers acting as a native but probably not worth the overall timeinvestment,0
this movie was playing on lifetime movie network last month and i decided to check it out i watched for the first twenty minutes and then shut it off bc i am sorry but plot holes that are integral to a movies plot make the movie nothing but garbagethe movie is about a woman who accidentally runs a child on a bicycle off the road leaves to get help returns only to find out that it is being called a hit and run and there is a hunt for the monster that hurt in the end killed herthis is a movie about a female in an affluent neighborhood who has two small grade school children and who is an active sociable woman and yet in order for this movie to work it needs to be believable that she does not own a cell phone sorry but that is complete bs especially when everyone else seems to have one  they used theirs to call nine hundred and eleven when they found the girl lying on the side of the road  when our lead female left the scene of the crime to go phone nine hundred and eleven at some payphone when the lead female comes back the ambulance is already at the girls side and there is chatter about how horrible the person is who hit and left herjust dumb sorry but i am not willing buy that this woman does not own a cell phone which is needed for the movie to work please do not insult my intelligence movie thanks maybe if this took place in one thousand nine hundred and seventy or one thousand nine hundred and sixty i would buy it but it is clearly a present day one thousand nine hundred and ninetynine at the time movie but wait if she had a cell phone there would be no movie pfftthe woman clearly knows about technology since she had computers in her house ones the kids played games on so all the movie had to do was make her cell phone dead in the car making her resort to another way to call the cops leaving out a cell phone altogether just created a ridiculous plot,0
if you have ever wanted to know more about cab drivers then this is an excellent movie to watch for informational purposes only i can just hear it now wait just wait a second why do not we follow a cab driver through his entire day cabbies are funny and so are the people they meet and they only talk to each other for just a couple of minutes so the other actors should be cheap harry you take care of production joan you have got materials brian you go round up some actors and we will all meet back here tomorrow to start filmingthe first ninety of the movie could not have been any worse had that very thing happened at least with no planning whatsoever there is always the element of surprise to be found some of jim carreys movies have stuff added as they go along and they always do well at the box offices the problem here is that the first ninety is pretty well scripted out and it pretty much sucks paul dillon plays the cab driver in chicago who is working all day we pretty much see what he sees people get in and out of his car and he drives all around town he talks to those people for a few seconds and then we get some more people i will admit there were a couple of funny bits here and there a religious family tries to talk the cab driver into going to church with them he takes a pregnant lady and her husband to the hospital breaks up a rich businessman from his girlfriend a poor girlfriend from her boyfriend and takes a rape victim home i guess the moral of the movie is that a cab driver is more than a cab driver and has a larger sphere of influence over the lives of his passengers than you might originally think for some people he is just a means of getting from here to there but for others his very ordinary words help change the direction of their livesthe last passenger of the day is used to try make sense of the rest of the movie and to a small extent it succeeds it had a bit of that deathbed repentance feel to it where the good majority of the movie sucks and then at the very end it tries to make it all better in just one or two changes i was not too impressed with the movie as a whole but there were a few bits and pieces worth watching again as far as the actors go paul dillon is it john cusack gillian anderson and julianne moore are all in this for about thirty seconds each but do not watch this for any of them or you will most certainly be disappointed i will give the other people invovled some credit that it is not your ordinary movie they have produced here but it was not a very good one either there just was not enough material to keep you going for an hour and a half it was a decent effort but it failed none the same,0
the episode begins with scenes of a dead woman bather washed up on the shore a forlorn jim strolling along the beach lost in reverie and a night ride home that ends in murder and mystery yepthis is an atmospheric little number with a super twist at the end jim does well to unravel what is a priori an inexplicable case of a woman going missing twenty seconds after she enters her home to be sure the eventual explanation is a little farfetched why for example go to the lengths of substituting a woman midway thru a car journey when simply rubbing her and her companions out would have been as easy and left less of a trail however these niggles aside it is a memorable trf episode full of invention even if yet again jim gets put in the frame by an ever suspicious police dept i mean to say have the ungrateful soandso is ever sat down and counted just how many of their files have been solved by dear old jimbo,1
for all of us american deneuve fans this little gem is a little tough to get ahold of fortunately i found myself so wrapped up in the short bits that i saw previewed on youtubecom that i was willing to go to any lengths i found it on ebaycom ordered it directly from france and changed my laptop so it would play region two dvds let me tell you that it was well worth it be warned  there are no subtitles unforunately pathe should not have released this on dvd koch lorber should have  they are good about the subtitles i do not speak a word of french i can utter a syllable here and there order a drink and whatnot that having been said this film was a treat anyway i could not fully appreciate the supposed bawdy humor or the witty dialogue watching deneuve and her cohorts was enough for me i understood what was going on without need of the dialogue it really says something about a film when those who cannot speak the language enjoy it the cinematography is wonderful london is adorable as the smitten sononlaw loved the lesbian mom and of course what can i possibly say about our dear mademoiselle deneuve she is one of a kind those eyes that smile i could watch her films all day she really goes beyond beauty people always say she is gorgeous well yes she is but she is also very talented i believed her every second of the way her conversation about chocolate and vanilla with london is too sweet her character even gets arrested for smoking dope with some fifteen year old in the street not to be missed fly to france and buy this if you have to great ten,1
i have seen many many movies and this just totally blew my mind the trauma the suspense is just amazing i ended so wound up in the psychological fear and philosophy of it and relating it to reality movies that play and challenge your mind are movies you do not forget those that make you doubt your reality a problem could be the quality but that does not bring down the essence of the moviethe idea it self is brilliant and the ending leaves you just completely shocked and with the question for you to seek the answer i just totally loved it so many clues and twitches and puzzles one of the best movies ever hands down,1
how is bear´s paw elephant´s trunk or monkey´s brain for dinner let tsui hark tell you in this wonderful and lighthearted comedy about the art of cooking the traditional chinese waythis movie shares the common structure of an american sports movie but instead of focusing on baseball it centers around cooking which makes it all the more interesting i even think leslie cheung´s character look a lot like charlie sheen in major leaguethis movie also contains a bit of zhao wen zhao vs xiong xin xin fighting love seeing more of that after the blade and a quite funny injoke concerning a leon lai pop songperhaps not the ideal movie for the strict vegetarian though,1
not really sure what to make of this movie very weird very artsy not the kind of movie you watch because it has a compelling plot or characters more like the kind of movie that you cannot stop watching because of the horrifically fascinating things happening on screen although the first time my wife watched this she could not make it all the way through too disturbing for her runs a bit long but nonetheless a worthwhile viewing for those interested in very dark movies,1
i absolutely loved this movie it is my number one favorite although there were a few flaws what movie does not have flaws this movie was very well written directed and produced the characters in this movie are very real and believable they made all of the characters fit into a specific role i think that the most apparent thing about here on earth was the love triangle as well as the other emotional situations brought into the movie it is not one of those movies where you just cannot seem to relate to anything because in it are situations that everyone is or has been in there are so many different things going on in this movie that it is hard not to relate to it i am just eighteen years old and i can even relate to it it was heart warming and wrenching at the same time here on earth will make you laugh cry and sometimes angry i give this movie an excellent review and recommend it to anyone who loves romance and passion,1
it starts a little slow but give it a chance in the spirit of the wackiest ship in the arm and the pink sub this movie is about a not so orthodox group engaged in not so orthodox methods to outwit everyone rob schneider is priceless as a lt that takes himself way too seriously which results in a failed mutiny attempt and pirate crew makes him walk the plank in contrast kelsey grammarsimilar to cary grantdoes not take anything to serious except the job this movie is more about lines than plot from the beered up fisherman in charleston harbor to the whale decoy their antics took me by surprise and i laughed out loud,1
the only reason i rented the movie was to see jeri ryan in it omg that was the most boring pointless movie i have ever seen how lame i mean really give me a break after voyager i would hope she would be offered better rolesif i were one of the last people on earth i would not still be living in a travel trailer in the dessert this is just such a bad movie the thing about the indian tribe and how he compared it every ten seconds really really got old poor jeri better luck next time,0
koyaanisqatsi and powaqqatsi are both beautiful films but this final installment of the trilogy is a major let down they got too carried away with stock footage and photography so little content the executive producer puts his own image in the film its just pretentious maybe if they had more than three million to spend maybe it would have been something i actually thought steven soderbergh directed it because it was so bad but godfrey reggio the director of koyaanisqatsi and powaqqatsi directed this i will have to assume that they just did not have the budget to make a decent film you would think that francis ford coppola would have wanted to be a part of this film and help get more money together,0
this was one of the few shows that my wife and i agreed on watching i was upset to hear that it was canceled especially because i did not realize the ratings were so poor as far as i knew it was doing very well with a lot of viewers almost all my friends and most of the people i spoke to watched the show now we are stuck watching either crappy shows or dvds how bad was the show doing does anyone know the real results of the shows viewings i know that when it went to thursdays it was more difficult for me to catch thank gd for dvrs anyways this was a real surprise to know that there will be no more the war at home if any other networks see this please pick up the show please,1
i keep waiting for peter fonda to start acting for someone who comes from such a talented family it is a mystery to me why peter fonda can only play peter fonda trying to play someone else and that is the good news in this disappointing dog of an adaptation of the tempest a string of loosely connected ideas that only suggest a relationship with the bards great play is what we are served the setting is the civil war and prosperos here guideons evil brother looks like an one thousand eight hundred and ninetys melodrama villain complete with snidely whiplash moustache i kept waiting for him to go uh ha hah which would have been a high point in this dreary presentation none of the supporting cast was memoriable and peter fondas lack of expression and wooden body movements made the lackadaisical story drag on and on the tempest is the bards statement about the rage of mans unjust treatment of man the only believable character was the gator man the caliban counterpart the transferrence to the swamp had possibilities but the civil war setting just did not make it all in all a very disappointing production i saw it on video and would advise if you want a willy shakespeare fix save your money on this one rent something else like branaghs much ado about nothing or kevin kline in midsummers night dream,0
purchased this film for one dollar and figured i could never go wrong my big mistake was watching it enjoyed the acting of icet and the rapping which gave lots of class to this film about los angeles and the world of pimps there is a boxer who kills one of his opponents in a practice ring and who has a career but because of mental problems from childhood and the killing of this other boxer he retires he gets hired by a pimp who is looking for a bodyguard to protect the girls that work for him at their trade and make sure they are not beaten up this boxer falls in love with the bosss girlfriend and all kinds of trouble starts this is entertaining and it then becomes a big laughing comedy,0
when i first saw this film around six months ago i considered it interesting but little more but it stuck with me that interest grew and grew and i wondered whether my initial boredom and response had more to do with the actual vhs quality rather than the film itself i purchased the criterion dvd box set and it turns out that i was right the second time alexander nevsky is a great film it is rousing and i am sure it succeeded in its main aim propaganda against the germansthat is the most common criticism against this film and against eisenstein that it is merely propagandist and nothing else it is untrue he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived by now the world is far enough beyond joseph stalin to be able to watch eisensteins films as art,1
i saw this movie unfortunately because it was the only option at that time and because david zucker was the director i saw his previous naked gun both parts airplane and top secret and i liked at least i had a good time and laughed i am not saying that the movies i mentioned were master pieces but were ok i do not recall any other more stupid movie than this it is incredible how hollywood industry is in total decadence if some studio spends any money to produce this awful picture then is not a surprise that this kind of histories are more common on these days this is a clear reflect of a decadent civilization where sex symbols and stupid plots are produced to entertain the common people i do not have any good to say about this film if you are planning to rent it or buy it please do not waste your money or your time avoid it no matter what even if you are fan of one of the actors does not worth it in fact this could be a very good example of what a director should avoid i will not see a zucker movie again he is planning to direct the fourth sequel of scary movie imagine that pathetic awful,0
joline heather graham married carl luke wilson and about five hundred and some days later carl is very depressed and leaves her expecting to clean the fog in their lives joline faces her marriage as an important commitment to the end of her life and decides to look for carl in texas she is very supported by her brother jay casey affleck who meets her in the border of mexico there joline meets the confused carl and realizes that she can not change his decision while jay knows carmen patricia velasquez and starts dating her and in the end life goes on this movie is very unpredictable having a very different story i believe it is an independent production in some parts it is a little slow and boring but there are certain dialogs that makes this movie worthwhile i liked it and my vote is seventitle brazil rebeldes até o fim rebels until the end,1
i was told about this film from a friend who saw it late night during the week he told me it was so bad that i had to see it so i went on an auction site and bought the film this is probably the worst film i have ever seen it makes you laugh when it really should not terrible acting and terrible storyline plus he looks nothing like michael jacksoni still recommend buying this film as its one of the funniest things you will ever see van peebles is a joke in this filmrobots cannot bluff psychei have to say though the special effects are actually amazing psyche dvds were probably even out when this film came out but if i had my way it would be a straight to vhs release yes people it is that bad,0
like the blair witch project before it hatchet has garnered its own fair share of publicity from the bottomonup as an avid reader of fangoria magazine the fullpage ads are hard to miss even after its middling theatrical run the film is bound to subsist solely on the hype surrounding it and will probably turn into a cult item at some point with a myspace url and a mighty if puzzlingly subjective promise of preserving socalled old school american horror hatchet will draw a lot of curiosity seekers with its dvd release where that claim is emblazoned on the disc itself perhaps it was the largeprint blurb from are not it cool news on the ads that caused me to approach the film with some trepidation it seems that harry knowles and his minions will approve of any film for vip passes and free food but hatchet makes me question what writerdirector adam greens idea of old school american horror really is based on the evidence here it means the insipid lateeightys ripoffs of friday the thirteenth and deliverance the characters are obnoxious stereotypes black chris tucker type survivalist chick topless bimbos requisite old couple asian tour guide whose interactions are marred by painful tryingtobehip dialogues and mostly obvious stabs at humor not quite as bad as cabin fever but still the script has too much padding the rustling bush scene for example and hatchet winds up as typical as any postmodern slasher of the last decade with its only distinguishing trait an expertlycalculated hype machine i will give it some faint praise for the goreif you can wade through the padding in between kills the red vino is definitely a thing of wonder and the only real reason to watch this,0
being a fan of time travel stories i was surprised that there was no device that sent russell johnsons character through time he just appeared in one thousand eight hundred and sixtyfive it was a disappointing part of the episode i enjoyed the premise of the dangers of altering the future by changing the past other twilight zone episodes about time travel such as no time like the past once upon a time etc were more to my liking because of the uses of time travel devices perhaps if russell johnsons character had been the same character he played in execution it would have been more acceptable to fans like myself as scifi fans know no characters really ever have to die in time travel episodes all sorts of plot twists can be applied in these types of stories that was the only flaw i could comment on for this episode,1
a great showfirst to the people who do not like itdo not like it then do not watch itthis iswas an awesome show better than according to jim a favorite of mine it shows a real family household as opposed to eight simple rulesetc where everything goes peachythey are loud they are messyi can sympathize with their dragging all the garbage into the kitchen it happens in real lifesorta like the portal to hell and everyone growling like dogs over the fastfood boxesit is a been there showyou know what is coming but fun to watch because you have been there beforea good cast they work great together a admirable enough show to warrant a dvd release mel gibsons safety videos were a highlight of the series as wellopinion good show really deserving of a dvd release deserving to not be canceled as well,1
this was a very funny fast paced movie i watched it more than once and am keeping my rental around to show others i would just like to take this opportunity to ask anyone in the know how do hk producers choose their subtitle translators i am most curious please direct me again to return to review it is a really rollicking film with plenty of content subtleties reminiscent of the classics though full of slapstick reminiscent say of the mexican comedies of cantinflasthe film does not disappoint fans of the director who have noticed that he chooses distinctly chinese themes trying to get to characteristics rarely explored the directors entire collection is way of getting a look inside the culture in a disarming wayand i do not see how his funny girl in chinese feast could be topped,1
imagine if you will an alternative universe where someone has made seven where instead of a talented cast and crew they have cast a politically conscious environmentalist and a stand up comedian as the leads  if your imagination cannot stretch that far just watch the glimmer man as it is the next worse thing  mild spoilers jack cole is a cop with a hidden past and it is very ironic that he is played by steven seagal since he is also someone witrh a hidden past  but do not tell anyone because it is top secret  perhaps the biggest secret is how someone like seagal became a movie star in the first place since the glimmer man continues in the vein of all of seagals other movies in that it is utter  utter crap  look at the way he is introduced as his partner walks into his office  yoi love beads man  in you are in the wrong office  steven replies with something that is side splittingly witty  or he would if anyone was able to understand a bloody word he said because for much of the movie he just mumbles away  in fact the only time i could make out his dialogue was the scene at the school where he bursts in on the gunman holding the class hostage  do not make me kill you  is this what a cop would say to a suicidal gunman  i am just thinking that in another movie where steven is not the hero  ie a good movie  the cop would say something along the lines of  do not kill me  i have got a wife and a couple of kids waiting at home   so anyway suicidal gunman goes to blow his head off but steven saves his life by hurtling them both through two sets of windows  it goes without saying that you should not try this at homeas the story progresses steven  i have given up on calling him jack though credit to the screen writer for giving steven a sensible name  becomes involved in a case a plagiarism where someone has been stealing bits out of other superior movies featuring serial killers  as steven finds more victims you can see him thinking  what was that movie that starred morgan freeman as a cop   as he inspects the bodies  oh and the action keeps switching back to the heros domestic life just so we know that this guys good as a family man  this guys very good as a family man such a pity he is so bad as a movie star,0
my favourite police series of all time turns to a tvfilm does it work yes gee runs for mayor and gets shot the homicide hall of fame turns up pembleton and nearly all of the cops who ever played in this series a lot of flashbacks helps you who hasn´t seen the tvseries but it amuses the fans too the last five minutes solves another murder and at the very end even two of the dead cops turn up and a short appearance from my favourite coroner juliana cox this is a good film,1
tumbling doll of flesh aka niku daruma and psycho the snuff reels this was on my want list for quite a while and then i finally scored a copy on ebay a while back it is never been on dvd and what i got from ebay was a very good quality dvdr which i am quite satisfied with the movie is i believe the most extreme example of torture porn with an emphasis on porn a woman responds to an ad for a porn movie and goes with the producer to a place where it is filmed the porn is definitely real with the annoying japanese pixelation to try and hide the hardcore shots without much success most of the time after the porn movie is shot and the actress is ready to leave she gets clubbed over the head with a baseball bat and taken back to the room and savagely dismembered in slow shots and in one of the most disgusting scenes the male porn guy screws her in an open wound in her chest this is after both legs have been severed her arm and a few other niceities this movie outdoes the guinea pig series by a long shot in fact they are not even close to the realism although cheap gore effects shown in this movie this is indeed one of the best fake snuff films i have ever seen if not the best now i must warn you that if you are not into this stuff you should stay far far away this movie is very strong and with the real sex it is in a very sick way erotic to an extent and i mean in a very sick way but wherever you come down on this subject material this movie brings the goods home and i would definitely recommend you seek it out after reading about the movie i was expecting something very strong but it exceeded that by a bunch,1
though this film does not stand out particularly from the movie crowd its still a very nice film to sit down and watch with your feet up there maybe the odd one or two mistakes you catch and the cinematic are a little slipshod the film itself is very enjoyable and has a wonderful atmosphere to it the music contributes a lot to the mood of the moviethe acting is none the less impressive especially the dog he he with john travolta taking the lead of the funtroublesomeloving michael other characters feel very genuine and perform very well within the filmso after a long day at work stick michael on in the evening with some icecream and enjoy a very quality film in its own right ,1
