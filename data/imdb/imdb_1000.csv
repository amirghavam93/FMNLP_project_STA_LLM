there is no relation at all between fortier and profiler but the fact that both are police series about violent crimes profiler looks crispy fortier looks classic profiler plots are quite simple fortiers plot are far more complicated fortier looks more like prime suspect if we have to spot similarities the main character is weak and weirdo but have clairvoyance people like to compare to judge to evaluate how about just enjoying funny thing too people writing fortier looks american but on the other hand arguing they prefer american series  maybe it is the language or the spirit but i think this series is more english than american by the way the actors are really good and funny the acting is not superficial at all,1
this movie is a great the plot is very true to the book which is a classic written by mark twain the movie starts of with a scene where hank sings a song with a bunch of kids called when you stub your toe on the moon it reminds me of sinatras song high hopes it is fun and inspirational the music is great throughout and my favorite song is sung by the king hank bing crosby and sir saggy sagamore overall a great family movie or even a great date movie this is a movie you can watch over and over again the princess played by rhonda fleming is gorgeous i love this movie if you liked danny kaye in the court jester then you will definitely like this movie,1
george p cosmatos rambo first blood part ii is pure wishfulfillment the united states clearly did not win the war in vietnam they caused damage to this country beyond the imaginable and this movie continues the fairy story of the ohso innocent soldiers the only bad guys were the leaders of the nation who made this war happen the character of rambo is perfect to notice this he is extremely patriotic bemoans that usamericans did not appreciate and celebrate the achievements of the single soldier but has nothing but distrust for leading officers and politicians like every film that defends the war eg we were soldiers also this one avoids the need to give a comprehensible reason for the engagement in south asia and for that matter also the reason for every single usamerican soldier that was there instead rambo gets to take revenge for the wounds of a whole nation it would have been better to work on how to deal with the memories rather than suppressing them do we get to win this time yes you do,0
in the process of trying to establish the audiences empathy with jake roedel tobey maguire the filmmakers slander the north and the jayhawkers missouri never withdrew from the union and the union army was not an invading force the southerners fought for states rights the right to own slaves elect crooked legislatures and judges and employ a political spoils system there is nothing noble in that the missourians could have easily traveled east and joined the confederate armyit seems to me that the story has nothing to do with ambiguity when jake leaves the bushwhackers it is not because he saw error in his way he certainly does not give himself over to the virtue of the because of abolition,1
yeh i know  you are quivering with excitement well the secret lives of dentists will not upset your expectations it is solidly made but essentially unimaginative truthful but dull it concerns the story of a married couple who happen to be dentists and who share the same practice already a recipe for trouble if it was not for our separate worklives we would all ditch our spouses out of sheer irritation campbell scott whose mustache and demeanor do not recall everyman so much as ned flanders from the simpsons is the mildmannered uberdad husband and hope davis is the boredstiff housewife who channels her frustrations into amateur opera one night as dad  the daughters attend one of davis performances he discovers that his wife is channeling her frustrations into more than just singing he witnesses his wife kissing and flirting with the director of opera one nice touch we never see the operadirectors face dreading the prospect of instituting the proceedings for separation divorce and custody hearings  profitable only to the lawyers  scott chooses to pretend ignorance of his wifes indiscretionsalready the literate among you are starting to yawn hohum another story about the pathetic sniveling little cuckold but rudolph who took the story from a jane smiley novella hopes that the wellwornness of the material will be compensated for by a series of flashy postmodern touches for instance one of scotts belligerent patients denis leary kept relatively  and blessedly  in check will later become a sort of construction of the dentists imagination emerging as a devilontheshoulder advocate for the oldfashioned masculine virtues dump the bh etc when not eggedon by his imaginary new buddy scott is otherwise tormented by fantasies that include his wife engaged in a threeway with two of the male dentalassistants who work in their practice it is not going too far to say that this movie is eyes wide shut for real people or grownups at least along those lines campbell scott and hope davis are certainly recognizable human beings as compared to the glamourpuss pair of cruise and kidman further the script for secret lives is clearly more relevant than kubricks as proof i offer the depiction of the dentists children particularly the youngest one who is about three or four years old and whose main utterance is dad dad dad dad dad dad this is family life all right with all its charmsthe movie would make an interesting doublebill with kramer vs kramer as well one can easily trace the feminization of the american male from one thousand nine hundred and seventynine to two thousand and three in this movie dad is the housewife as in kramer but he is in no way flustered by the domestic role unlike dustin hoffman who was too manly to make toast here scott gets all the plumb chores such as wiping up the childrens vomit cooking cleaning taking the kids to whatever inane afterschool activity is on the docket and all without complaint and without directorial commentary it is just taken for grantedthe film has virtues mostly having to do with verisimilitude however it is dragged down from greatness by its insistence on trendy distractions which culminate in a long scene where a horrible fiveday stomach flu makes the rounds in the household we must endure pointless fantasy sequences initiated by the imaginary ringleader leary whose existence by the way is finally reminiscent of the brad pitt character in fight club and this finally drives home the films other big flaw lack of originality in this review i realize it is been far too easy to reference many other films granted this film is an improvement on most of them but still the secret lives of dentists is worth seeing but do not get too excited about it not that you were all that excited anyway i guess,0
while this movies style is not as understated and realistic as a sound version probably would have been this is still a very good film in fact it was seen as an excellent film in its day as it was nominated for the first best picture oscar losing to wings i still consider wings to be a superior film but this one is excellent despite a little bit of overacting by the lead emil janningsjannings is a general from czarist russia who is living out his final days making a few bucks in the one thousand nine hundred and twentys by being a hollywood extra his luck appears to have changed as he gets a casting callto play an imperial russian general fighting against the communists during the revolution naturally this is not much of a stretch actingwise but it also gets the old man to thinking about the old days and the revolutionexactly what happens next i will leave to you but it is a pretty good filmparticularly at the end by the way look for william powell as the russian director despite being made in one thousand nine hundred and twentyeight with the makeup he does not look much younger than he did in many of his later films,1
i give this movie seven out of ten because the villains were interesting in their roles and the unknown batwoman creates an interesting guess who game the movie however needs more robin in it he appeared in the movie in the beginning and sporadically throughout the rest i always thought the new animated series did little justice to the neat new robin character let alone knightwing this movie just continues that bad tradition the movie spends too much time on bruce wayne and his romance which would not be so bad in one movie if the romance was not so unbelievable it is still a good movie if you are a batman fan and i would recommend watching it,1
really awful lead actor did ok the film plot etc was completely crap and inaccurate it may as well have been a sequel to well anything it had little or no relevance to carlitos way and should be avoided like the plague by any carlitos ways fans no mention of gail in fact he ends up with some other bird no mention of klienfelt no mention of how he got caught no mention of how he ended up in jail they attempted to make it like the original with flash backs at the beginning but to be honest when rating it i was looking for a zero mark unfortunately i had to rate it higherits a terrible attempt to cash in on what was one of the best films of the ninetys overall it was approximately £six and two hours of my life wasted for all the action in it it was truly boring slow and predictable again to any carltios way fans avoid this fiasco,0
good grief i cannot even begin to describe how poor this film is do not get me wrong i was not expecting much to begin with let us face it a pgthirteen slasher flick is predestined to be missing the ummm slashing so no one should be surprised by the lack of gore but it was the level of incompetence and cliché on display in all the other aspects of this movie is what really blew me away we have a protagonist who is quite simply so completely useless that you find yourself rooting for the bad guy and here is a turnup for the books she never changes  hence breaking the cardinal rule of basic screen writing  character development if you think by the end of this film the poor little girl is going to turn around and finally kick some arse then think again on top of this we are handed possibly the least intriguing and definitely the least scary killer ever to grace the genre i am not joking when i say that dora the explorer has scarier villains than this moviefinally because all the potential for tension or gratuity is removed by the inept and apparently thirteenyearold director what could possibly be left to fill up two hours of screen time closets that is what lots and lots of closets big closets small closets mirrored closets closets to narnia so many damned closets you will not want to dress yourself for another year in fact this movie should have just been called closet and had a picture of a big scary coathanger on the dvd case on the back it could have had a photograph of the audience falling asleep and a quote by roger and ebert  something to the extent of what the f did we just waste our time watching,0
home room deals with a columbinelike highschool shooting but rather than hashing over the occurrence itself the film portrays the aftermath and what happened to the survivors their trauma guilt and denialspoilers the shooting itself is treated as a foregone conclusion with no action footage other than the reaction of an almost teenage swat commando after shooting the high school killer the film has three protagonists the detective investigating the crime of which no guilty parties are left to convict and two teenage girls surviving the incident played by a very young erika christensen and busy philippsthe two girls having nothing in common besides the shooting are put together because of it and the drama ensueserika christensen though only twentyfour has been around the block so much that film viewers are pretty much acquainted with her solid and reliable style of acting busy philipps three years older than christensen and altogether unknown to me blew me away with her overwhelming dramatic strength and screen presence this girl was the partit is a great movie and it connects to you with its intimate focus on the fragile yet growing relationship between the two traumatized girls gus van sants elephant two thousand and three though good seems almost superficial and paltry compared to home room when it comes to dramatic flair and acting what i can see this film got very little screen time and exposure  so much more a loss for an equally traumatized americaten out of ten,1
this begins a wager between edgar allen poe and a journalistpoe bets that the man can not spend an entire night in a creepy castle well of course he can but will he come out unscathed hard to say with all these strange people that are not supposed to be there wandering around including the icy barbara steele this is a fairly odd film in that the presentation is both in french and english and switches back and forth a few times perhaps this is done because bits of dialog were lost it is also rather dark and claustrophobic being that one does not see much beyond a small circle of light that candles and such generate plus there is a feel of dread and impending doom pretty much at all times this version on synapse is also uncensored and i wondered what might be censored in a film from one thousand nine hundred and sixtyfour until i saw the topless scene i guess that might be it overall this is pretty good and in gloomy black and white barbara steele definitely makes the movie too eight out of ten,1
last weekend i bought this zombie movie from the bargain bin and watched it with some friends thinking it was going to be a budget version of land of the deadboy was i wrong it seems as if they spent a good portion of their budget on the coverart which is very misleading to fans of the zombie genrewe watched up to the point where the zombie chicks come alive and get in the car with some yuppie who is out in the middle of nowhere talking business on a cellphone they actually speak to the guy before one of the girls kills him but once they started driving the car i could not suspend my disbelief anymoresome people actually consider this a so bad it is good movie they are liars i did not finish the movie but one of the other reviews mention that they actually somehow become police officers at the end of the movie which makes me glad to not have watched it all the way throughthis is even worse than zombiez do not watch,0
well the reason for seeing it in the cinema was that it was a sneak preview else i would never have seen this terrible teenage slasher movie i mean have not we had enough of this yet scream and scary movie at least did not take them self serious the plot sucks and the acting is the worst i have seen only godzilla can compare which is also the only movie that competes in being the worst i have seen in the cinema with this onethere is so many plot holes in the story and the girls are so alike that you do not even now who has been killed and who has not and you do not care the only of them i knew in advance was denise and she was the most talent less actress i have ever seen in this bad excuse for a moviestay as far away from this movie as possible twoten,0
we have an average family dads a famous rapper we have the rebelious teenage daughter the adopted white kid and the cute little kid and we have careless housemaid what show has had a housemaid like that do we have a messedup brady bunch yay when it first came out i thought it was really cool mostly because i was young the music was bad the raps were so bad and they were too grated all of his raps were about his family and friends and problems the dad was kind of the danny from full house type of dad always gave the advice out but he was not a clean freak they had a housekeeper for that remember the plots were basically lil romeo was in trouble of some sort or not that is it oh and maybe some preteen drama yeah that stuff is good not really but its still a good show for kids but nikelodean could do better,0
when my sister said this movie was going to be good i had second thoughts but i watched it and it was actually funny basically the movie is made of a weird girl who goes to a small town where no one likes her and she just wants to go there and get the reading of her aunts will don so she can go but its not all that easy in this movie you will come across hilarious humor a witch a book of spellsrecopies a mentally challenged uncle and a dog you will understand the meaning of the word freak a after anyways i hope you run right out and try to find this really old movie hope you like it in total i will have to give it a zero no i am totally joking ill give it a nine hope you understand that you will laugh you will scream and you may just be offendedlove yours truly dakota you can email me at dakotalovesithot mailcom if you want to,1
i thought this was a wonderful movie it touches every fiber of a human being the love in the film is very intense i thought it was wills best performance to date great directing liked the editing music was great good use of flashback this is the kind of movie everyone should go see i hope people will get something wonderful from this overall excellent movie i think hollywood should make more movies with substance even action films can have a caring story i like the fact that will was very subtle in his acting he had a purpose and a dedication that is rare to see i would suggest watching this alone or with someone that you really care about for me i found that the world stopped and my only focus was on the film the outside world was suspended for a moment it was a nice feeling with all this chaos going on in this world and with this me generation it was great to see somethingsomeone that cared about other people more than himself,1
why on earth is colin firth in this pointless film has he really been that strapped for cashthe film is not clear on what it wants to be about grief exotic places ghosts a vehicle for mr darcy it is a muddled muddy messthere seems to be some sort of idea that italy must be good in itself and that italian has something to offer as a language  but in the end the girls just want to go back to yanklandthere are pointless episodes on the beach in churches on busy roads  but what it is all about or why anybody should care simply is not clearthere was also a yank woman in the film it was not clear what here job was but she seemed only to be there to make vapid inappropriate and maudlin comments to the girl was it supposed to be about paedophilliaa pretty dreadful mess all in all i gave it two rather than one because it does not have the charm of an utterly ghastly film,0
back in one thousand nine hundred and eightyfive i caught this thing i cannot even call it a movie on cable i was in college and i was with a high school friend whose hormones were raging out of control i figured out early on that this was hopeless stupid script a bunch of old guys hiring some young guys to show them how to score with women bad acting with one exception and pathetic jokes the plentiful female nudity here kept my friend happy for a whilebut even he was bored after thirty minutes in rememberthis was a high school boy this was back before nudity was so easy to get to by the internet and such we kept watching hoping for something interesting or funny but that never happened the funniest thing about this was the original ad campaign in which the studio admitted this film was crap one poster had a fictional review that said this is the best movie i have seen this afternoon only grant cramer in the lead showed any talent and has actually gone on to a career in the business nobudget and boring ta skip it,0
it is easy to forget once later series had developed the alien conspiracy plot arc more that once upon a time the xfiles wrote episodes like genderbender and fearful symmetry where the aliens were not all little grey men or mindcontrol goop but could actually surprise youfearful symmetry starts with an invisible elephant  actually an elephant somehow dislocated in space and time not a mile away from the walk  and ends with a pregnant gorilla being abducted and it is very much an episode of wonderful moments the subplot is annoyingly worthy  yeah we get it zoos are bad except when they are not  but the ideas that within it are fascinating visually powerful and very memorable and it covers an angle on abduction that is largely overlooked  why would humans be the only things that aliens are interested inin the end it was not an instant classic but it was enjoyable viewing while it lasted again very memorable and mainly it is something that you could not imagine many other shows doing,1

i am usually not one to say that a film is not worth watching but this is certainly an extenuating circumstance the only true upside to this film is cornelia sharpe looking rather attractive and the fact that this film is really shortthe plot in the film is unbelievably boring and goes virtually nowhere throughout the film none of the characters are even remotely interesting and there is no reason to care about anyone i am not sure why on earth sean connery agreed to do this film but he should have definitely passed on this onethe only reason i could see for seeing this film is if you are a diehard sean connery fan and simply want to see everything he is done save this one for last thoughwell if you by some miracle end up seeing this despite my review or any of the other reviews on this site then i hope you enjoy it more than i did thanks for reading,0
not funny  how can anyone link this to monty python that is absolutely ridiculous  there are no laughs this is not funny over the top but ugly weird just for weird sake and it seems to me these people were on something all the time unfortunately something that did not make them funnyit should be given some points for effort etc whatever actually it appears there is a laugh track  or is there one hummm since there are barely any laughs that is a debatable questionmaybe i am doing it injustice  maybe it is some sort of exercise some sort of art  in that case anything goes never mindbut these guys playing women with highpitched voices turnedup noses come on  not funny there is only one heir apparent to monty pythons intellectual wit and that is stephen colbert and maybe jon stewart,0
okay i rented this movie because of the directorhe has made some interesting flicks in the past if you have not seen waxork you are missing a fun ride anyway i had my doubts about this movie from the beginning but i decided to suck it up and give it a look it is bad very bad if you have not seen the movie and do not mind spoilers read ahead first of all the old saying you cannot judge a book by it is cover applies here the box for this flick seems to indicate that jill is the stone fox with long hair with highlights the back of the box has a cool shot of the redleather jill and some other shots the description makes you want to rent the movie because it sounds good you start watching it and suddenly you find out that the movie takes place inexplicably in one thousand nine hundred and seventyseven jill is a total dog who is not the girl on the cover the movie is not quite as predictable as you would thinkand that is not a good thing characters do so many stupid things without any modicum of motivationit is embarrassing to watch ten minutes before the end of the movie dolph and another lady have sex for no good reason also what was the point of having dolph kill this other lady in cold blood who had been helping him anthony hickox the director should have seen a stinker when he read the script had it been set in the underworld of the new milennium and made the characters halfway intelligent it might have been decent to set it in the seventys makes no sense and has no bearing on the story whatsoever avoid it,0
this obscure de sica delivers the goods and it is said the meek shall inherit the earth this tale of classes on the surface but really an allegory for all the homeless people that populated europe after the great war they are homeless but cheerful in a societies too impoverished and selfish to care for or acknowledge them footmats for the italian carpetbaggers de sica chooses to tell it as a fairy tale a cinderella story i have not read the book it is based on so i cannot foresay if the deus ex machina is the construct of the writer or vittorio it begins with the words once upon a time to exemplify the timelessness of its tale for the story could be set anywhere and everywhere caricature sketches of the aristocracy that cut to the bone whimsical nature of the homeless especially when they begin to grant their wishes and an ending right out of a spielberg picture makes this boulange a delight for all de sicas most accessible picture is also one of his best abandoning neorealism he always dallied between that and pure good old filmmaking he creates a movie that breaks the heart and at the same time fills it with the yearning of hope that one needs to continue leaving in this world gracias vittorio gracias gracias gracias,1
wes craven you are having a laugh at our expense the red eye plot is preposterous we are confronted by a guy who has apparently spent eight weeks watching a girl who then turns up at an airport behind her flirts and chats her up successfully somehow wangles a seat next to her in a two seat space not trapped in the middle of a five seat row contacts at checkin and is cheezily nice during a painfully slooooow build up then once up in the air in a confined space surrounded by strangers he immediately starts threatening the vacuous if superefficient rachel mcadams and saying tosh like we got ya daddy do what i say or poppa gets it well forgive me but did not they already have her daddy ready for slaughtersoyoubetteroughta long before she stepped on the plane and therefore would not it have been oh sooooooo much simpler to simply snatch the gal off the street and terrorise her in a room somewhere forgetting the complicated and insecure dad plot pulling her nails out or whatever until she made the all important call required or even  cos this is the movies and we need a few unreal twists  keep the dumb dadindistress thing intact if you must but dress it up better so that holding him in harms way until the convoluted plot had been concluded made some sense without the plane dumbdown alternatively without wanting to sound like an actual thinking terroristassassin  could not the massive bazookamissile thang employed have been far more easily used on say a car driving down the highway with the politician inside rather than the fiftyth story of a miami seafront hotel from a fishing boat mind you as we already know security in miami is lax so they will speed away i know i know far more fun to go through watching a pretty girl for eight weeks burgle her dads house to steal his wallet that somehow  star trek style  gets transported from miami to texas instantly in order to  perhaps  get her to arrange for a politician to change hotel room and and and well a thousand things could go wrong here each one entirely destroying the big plan so why not slim the elements down to a sensible handful such as  one bazooka two car three boom my fifty minute drive home from the cinema was spent highlighting the abundance of flaws and stupid codhitchcockian twists which sadly was the best fun of the whole sorry experience and as for security back at miami airport we have an apparently crazy and violent girl running off a plane chased by cops who during the chase sits down to have a coffee moves elsewhere to read a magazine at a bar then runs again like crazy up and down the whole terminal by now also chased by crazed cillian murphy no cctv then  i had guns pulled on me for parking in the wrong place for ten seconds at miami airport a couple of years back so instead of speaking to the cops  her allies  or getting on the blower at a callbox direct to her dad to warn him his life is in danger mcadams prefers instead to steal a people carrier off a family in the airport forecourt call the damned security and drives home to daddy mowing down the assassin with the vehicle in the front garden of the house in a rich neighbourhoodwatch district crushing the front porch in the process  an act which actually slightly wakes dad up from an afternoon snooze after about a minute yet which somehow fails to register with neighbours who are not even mildly curious thus ensuring fifteen more minutes of hide and seek shenanigans as the duo run around the vast hollodeck type house dohhh it actually hurts to keep thinking about it all  cillian surely renamed silly un for doing this one preposterously turns from ice assassin to comically unhinged and inept lunatic killer at the end this theoretically ruthless despatcher of human life now allowing the dad to live so that he can watch his daughter getting her goose cooked i would better stop because the stream of drivel i am writing here must sound as uncoordinated as the red eye script if ms mcadams had not been allowed to get on the plane in the first place the title could have been altered from red eye to no eye dear rr,0
i love horses and admire hand drawn animation so i expected nothing short of amazement from dreamworks new animated picture spirit stallion of the cimarron i guess you could say i was a little bit disappointed you have wonderful animation and at first what seems like a perfect story a story about absolutely nothing but a horse in nature the animals do not sing cute songs or even talk  a major plus sadly the film has an uncalled for narration by matt damon a sappy soundtrack by bryan adams and enough action scenes to compare it to a jerry bruckheimer production if the film makers would have just stayed with simplicity we would have a masterpiece here this is not a great film but it is good entertainment for small children i would recommend this film to families because it has its heart in the right place and its the only thing out there right now that is not offensive to small children not bad but could have been much better very pretty visuals though,1
the first and only time i saw shades was during a sneakpreview it had not even been in premiere i remember there was someone of the directors staff there do not even remember who it was a belgian movie we never heard of it so we were quite neutral not knowing what to expect mickey rourke is a brilliant actor and he is stands miles ahead all the rest he plays an actor who is star has long stopped rising he is helping to realise a movie in belgium entitled shadesas soon as the movie started we noticed how much swearing there is nothing against the occasional swear word however this was way beyond annoying whenever rourke uses the f word to express something it comes naturally however when someone from the cast a nonenglish speaker uses the f or s word it becomes arrogant and aggressivewe quickly lost count of how many times they used the f and s words everybody was just glad to be out of the theatre and we had to give a vote but it was hard for us because it was only from zero to ten and we were looking for the ten,0
i seriously love this film so much i never get sick of watching it the only line i really cannot stomach in this is when riff calls herself a teenage lobotomy but other than that everything else is perfect i have never been a fan of pj soles and it did not help to hear that she did not even know who the ramones were until she filmed this movie but i can ignore her snarly little face for the most part most people who watch this over and over are fans of the ramones and really that is the only reason i love it so much i never get tired of seeing deedee mess up his pizza lines or joey mess up the name of the teacher over and over haha one of the best parts of the film is seeing them sing do you want to dance  down the halls of the high school i love it the special edition dvd has a good retrospective surprisingly pj soles is not on it maybe she was working on another project laugh anyway great film even better if you are a ramones fan,1
this is the best scifi that i have seen in my twentynine years of watching scifi i also believe that dark angel will become a cult favorite the action is great but jessica alba is the best and most gorgeous star on tv today,1
it is good to see that vintage film buff have correctly categorized their excellent dvd release as a musical for that is what this film is pure and simple like its unofficial remake murder at the windmill one thousand nine hundred and fortynine the murder plot is just an excuse for an elaborate girlie show with kitty carlisle and gertrude michael leading a cast of superdecorative girls including ann sheridan lucy ball beryl wallace gwenllian gill gladys young barbara fritchie wanda perry and dorothy white carl brisson is also on hand to lend his strong voice to cocktails for two undoubtedly the movies most popular song it is heard no less than four times however it is gertrude michael who steals the show not only with her rendition of sweet marijauna but her strong performance as the heros rejected girlfriend as for the rest of the cast we could have done without jack oakie and victor mclaglen altogether the only good thing about oakies role is his weak running gag with cult icon toby wing in fact to give you an idea as to how far the rest of the comedy is overindulged and overstrained superdumb inspector mclaglen simply cannot put his hands on the killer even though would you believe in this instance it happens to be the person you most suspect director mitch leisen actually goes to great pains to point the killer out to even the dumbest member of the cinema audience by giving the player concerned closeup after closeup,1
i just finished watching this movie it was not ridiculously bad but i am really disappointed with it i am not really sure why someone would make a movie like this it was marginally entertaining but i feel like the people making it had a lot of disagreements on what they were making monday the writer was in charge tuesday the director wednesday the guy who gets the coffee etc it almost seems like they really wanted to make a couple different movies but only had the time and money to make onesomeone else commented that the acting was really good but i would have to disagree then again if the actors were able to keep a straight face during the filming perhaps they are better actors than i give them credit forthe back of the dvd gives the impression that the movie would be a mystery something along the lines of a historical law and order or national treasure it starts off like that but then out of nowhere it takes a turn towards a bad episode of the twilight zone or what was that other show that was not as good a bad episode of the outer limitsmy main complaint about the movie is that it is just so played out there is the evil guy with spiked white hair there is the love interest who when she first appears the wind actually blows through her hair seriously once you realize it is a christian movie the end is also pretty easy to spotthe cinematography was poorly done especially in the opening scenes  way to put your best foot forward it was not atrocious for most of the movie but there was the occasional ridiculously bad shot of an old lady praying arms up in a dark room while lightening is striking  the sort of thing that just makes you a little bit embarrassed to be watching the movie,0
slither is a horror comedy that does not really have enough horror or comedy to qualify as one or the other it has one scene that is exceptionally good any number of zingers that work but very few real scares and not enough humor to maintain the movie in addition the script does not focus on the hero and heroine and goes off kilter in several placesa major failing of this film is that it introduces and then leaves its hero fillion to follow grant grant michael rooker as he is first introduced and then becomes the monster this whole part of the film drags  michael rookers character is not that interesting to us as a person and watching as he goes through a series of motions while acting in the monsters interest might be interesting if this was grant  portrait of a man turning into a monster rather than a horrorcomedy alien invasion movie in the final analysis this movies problems are in the script  it is not that important to the audience how the monster acts or propagates the purpose of a horrorcomedy is to get the heroes backed up in a corner with shotguns and then throw bugs at them with them cracking wise every time something frightening or disgusting happens instead we get an exploration of the aliens habits and tactics that just makes this part of the movie drag the ostensible heroine elizabeth banks as starla grant is more central to this part but nonetheless i felt the movie had left its narrative track unless it planned on following grant grant all the way to the endwhen fillion and his posse finally confront the alien the movie does begin to cook but once again the problem is in the script by this point that audience knows  and the characters should know  that grant is not just suffering from some disease and act accordingly shotguns  instead they continuously parley in the face of increasing evidence that this is not something that let us get you to a hospital is going to help although their reactions might have been human and real these are characters in an action movie and simply should have done what the movie promised  delivered action a lack of action scenes in a movie with as few ideas as this is a great failing spoilers ahead  after the first confrontation and the bursting of the alien larval sack a minor character and perhaps the best scene in the movie the script once again betrays the movie at this point one of the characters is almost taken over by the alien and develops an insight into the alien the writerdirector gunn chooses as this character a completely new character rather than one of already developed minor characters why why did he need to introduce a completely new character more than an hour into the movie that becomes central to the plot by the time this character is attacked we know hardly anything about her and could care less about her even though she is a winsome teenage girl in her bath had gunn decided not to use this character and just used one of the established minor characters he could have completely avoided introducing her family and saved time and money furthermore the hero and heroine would have been filled in on the aliens plans without all the additional characters and could have gotten around to blowing away aliens sooner and with more vigormy last criticism is based on the movies look gunn is primarily a writer or maybe it was budgetary constraints but this movie looked ugly and uninteresting most of the action takes place at night in woods or on a field and the screen simply looks drab the sets in wheelsy the fictional town where the action takes place look cheap the whole movie looks cheap box office mojo states the films budget was fifteen million newspapers say twentynine million and considering they did not use any name talent i would say the money did not show up on screen the monster is just repulsive and rarely looks deadlythe last criticism is primarily based on the reality of the characters actions by the time fillion and co have begun hunting grantthe alien one woman has disappeared and grant is known to have been mutilating animals at this point i was expecting the fbi or at least the state police to show up and take over from the hick sheriff a woman has disappeared and likely been murdered and a local has been acting psychotic time to call the authorities but basically i was hoping that would happen because i just wanted some characters who would show up and actalthough this movie is ostensibly a horrorcomedy the movie it bears the most resemblance to is dreamcatcher in terms of monstrous invasion and the type of monster and its intentions whereas dreamcatcher had much bigger problems with story especially the entire morgan freeman subplot and particularly the ending in many ways it was stronger primarily because the main characters were stronger but more importantly because it looked beautiful although that may be anathema  preferring the movie that is weaker in general plot and structural spine because of production values  that just shows you how uninteresting i found the look of slither,0
gus van sant has made some excellent films i truly am a fanhowever i cannot help but feel that the cerebral edge of tom robbins book even cowgirls get the blues is lost in translation to the big screen alone tom robbins and gus van sant are incredible visionaries and towers of talent ultimately though this one just did not work it was not that the characters were not well developed or the plot and content did not come alive it is just that our imaginations are much more powerful when reading a book like this we are taken away to a different time and place and we sometimes think the worst andor the best and it adds to the overall rollercoaster of the book as it neatly unfolds according to the authors precision movies however can leave one with less of the imagination and emotion rollercoaster detracting from the overall experience this is what i believe happened herei suggest reading the book,1
what an appalling piece of rubbish who are all these people who blubber on about how good this is yes it is arty and yes it is foreign but  that is not enough the plot is boring and disjointed like a reality show but not so slickly madethe people are intrinsically uninteresting but as characters they do not have enough depth to feel empathy for them if they are based on real people then i feel very very sorry for themthe violence and some of it is very violent seems quite ostentatious and gratuitous it is like the producer has visions of being quenton tarantino not that i think very much of him eitherand oh yes if i had neighbours like these i would move,0
this is a formula b science fiction movie and the director made no bones about it it is about a dragon who is restored to life by a scientific team everything done is stuff you have seen many times before it is a weak script with no real characters in fact it is full of stereotype characters and situations the director attacks this by just making it a formula movie with no attempt to fool us and that gives this movie a mild appeal but it is not something you are likely to remember a while it is best seen while you are cooking cleaning working out sort of mindless fun it has its place in entertainment but it certainly is not something you sit down with friends to watch unless you are all just drunk and do not care the mass rating of threetwo is probably fair i do not think it is as crappy as most people but i am surprised that some people in the postings thought this was spectacular that really eludes me as i see no attempt to even make this a memorable film,0
i was living rawlins when this movie was made and i got lucky enough to be able to work on it both as an extra and with eddie surkin on special effects it was fun to see all the behind the scene workings from the barbedwire coming alive to the electric chair up through the wardens office floor also it was a lot of fun getting to meet all the actors from viggo to tiny also the gate that was cut into the prison wall for the movie was and still is called disney gate by locals if anybody is interested and is ever in rawlins most of the movies sets are still in place and can be seen during the self guided tour it was a lot of fun working for and with r harlin and wished i had a chance to do it again,1
i think that my favorite part of this movie the one that exemplifies the sheer pointless stupidity and inanity of the proceedings comes at the climax of the film doctor ted nelson and his unmarried friend the sheriff have finally cornered the melting man on a landing on some stairs in an electrical generating plant keep in mind that nelson has been looking for the mm for nearly the entire film and that the mm has killed and eaten several people at this point including his boss and nelson is very aware that mm is violently insane and hungry for human flesh and bloodso the sheriff has his gun pointed at mm who is and i give the movie and rick baker props for this the most disgusting and terrifying object in human form that we have ever seen and he yells a very important question to doctor ted nelson what do we do now the camera cuts over to doctor ted nelson and it is obvious that ted has no idea what to do next apparently ted was so intent on the problem of finding the melting man he never thought to bring along some restraining devices a lasso or straitjacket or a net or some tranquilizer darts or maybe a new age tape by vangelis to soothe the savage beastso the sheriff panics and shoots the melting man goes berserk and hilarity ensues maybe this explains why nasa has been screwing around with the space shuttle program in sublunar space for the last thirty years instead of going back to the moon or out to mars like everyone knows they ought to be doing i do not knowanyway that is the kind of lousy lazy writing and direction that undercuts every aspect of this movie it is hard to say how good the actors actually are because the movie has complete contempt for their characterstwo other incredibly painful sequences also ramp up the stupidity of the proceedings there is a scene featuring the lumpiest old couple in the world trying to steal lemons from a grove only to be torn apart by the melting man this scene is a nadir in seventys cinema i can guarantee you have never watched a more pointless and irritating setup with odder looking people in your entire life and the melting mans assault on the lady who lives in the house where they keep a horse who pees on the walls defies every attempt to process itby the way i think famous film director jonathon demme has a walkon in this scene as the redneck husband who goes in first to check on the house and never comes out again the only thing that keeps the actress from literally chewing the scenery is that as i said their horse has apparently been peeing on it and we are forced to watch her hysterics for at least two minutes longer than any sane film director would hold the shot burr debenning ought to beat the crap out of imms director and photographer i remember him from an old columbo episode where he looked much better than he does here  no ones idea of a leading man but solid and unobtrusive but no one could possibly be as unappealing in real life as his director makes him look here everyone else comes off a little better except for the old couple and shut up i know they were being played for laughs but i are not laughing but not much this definitely falls into the so bad you cannot look away category of cinema disasters still i would watch it again before i would watch a lot of other seventys and eightys abortions  track of the moonbeast and it lives by night come to mind and msts coverage of it is great fun so if you get a chance watch the mst version,0
quite possibly how francis veber one of the best comedy directors in the world at least when sticking to his native france managed to turn in a film so completely unwatchable is beyond the reason of mere mortal man to discern it is not just that the characters are so unlikeable or that the film is so utterly devoid of even the lowest form of wit it is genuinely physically painful to watch such an endless parade of inept writing acting and filmmaking that you cannot believe this is the work of experienced  and talented  filmmakers for once the neareternity spent in the cutting room and on the shelf before its blinkandyou willmissit theatrical release tells the whole story what were they thinking,0
as someone who was staggered at the incredible visuals of hero i was anxious to see this film which was billed as being along the same lines but better it also featured an actress i like ziyi zhang well i was disappointed on both counts i bought the dvd of this film sightunseen and that was a mistake it was not betteri realize these flyingthroughtheair martial arts films are pure fantasy but this story is stretched so far past anything remotely believable it just made me shake my head in disappointing disbelief a blind woman defeating hundreds of opponents sorry that is going a little far also the major male character jin takeshi kaneshiro was so annoying with his dialog stupid look on his face and stupid laugh that he ruined the film toodespite the wonderful colors and amazing action scenes this story  to me  just did not have an appeal to make it a movie worth owning this film is no hero of mine,0
this movie was horrible simply put it was so bad i registered with imdb to warn you of its dangersi am a campy horror film expert per se i have watched redneck zombies house of the psychotic women slumber party massacre ii and many others i know my schlock and i know this movie sucksthree fourths of the film is comprised of scared individuals running from one side of the screen to the other when they are not running they are spouting nonsequitur lines devoid of emotion or motivation when the actors begin to be acceptable the direction falls to pieces there were so many jarring lowangle shots i figured leif jonker had a three foot tall tripod he used what i call the leif maneuver several millions times that is zooming out from an object of interest like an amateur apparently the film crew could not get up early enough to film a sunrise so they filmed a sunset and played it in reverse with direction this lazy you are actually impressed with the final gory scene the only thing you can figure is that the last five minutes was filmed before the first eightyfive minutesif you want a good bad gory movie rent rikioh or the foundational dead alive if you are a schlock buff and are looking for a challenge give darkness a goquote of the movievampire it is die time,0
this film failed to explore the humanity of the animals which left me with an empty feeling inside spoiler ahead i was not convinced that dr d really had a compelling reason to forego the big buyout deal to help his furry friends whereas babe the original bucked the trend of bigbudget hits by focusing on the human virtues of the animals vs their humans counterparts all the animals in this film were nothing more than comical caricatures which one would gladly stuff in the meatgrinder even more so if one could understand their pointless babble without eddie murphys zany behavior this film would be a flop,0
thhetwo is entertaining in that you will laugh a lot and cringe and probably say oh sht and get your face away from the goddamn hole you dumbs or things along those lines but i do not know if its really worth seeing i was very annoyed throughout the entirety with the horrible military characters who do not seem to know the first thing about combatyes there was more violence gore and a higher body count than the first one but i am still am debating whether that cancels out my feeling throughout the whole movie about how ridiculous it is and not a good ridiculousness like dead alive or feast my time would have been better spent watching ajas remake for the fiveth timeso go for some laughs or go for some gore but do not go hoping to come out of it satisfied,0

back in the days before the toxic avenger the lowcamp kings at troma films tried to take the high ok somewhatlesslow road of producing straight slasher pics i would like to think that viewing the results here is what convinced them to give up all pretension and go for selfconscious parodysplatter university is another film for the masochists in the audience as it meanders about through two separate casts and innumerable pointless subplots it actually becomes painful to watch let us see if i can summarizeafter learning that a dangerous psychopath has escaped from a local hospital the action moves to a catholic university i do not recall the name but in honor of the title let us call it st splatter the students are listless and sullen and argue pettily with each other slackers ahead of their time meanwhile the new professor julie parker proves utterly incompetent at her job the kids deal with relationships infidelity unwanted pregnancies lecherous priests and how to avoid doing any work in class julie deals with a creepy boyfriend the inflexible administration at st splatter counseling unwed mothers and the blank expressionless looks of her students none of it means a darn thing or gets resolved in any meaningful way oh and every once in a while a pov shot comes along and stabs one of the girls to death but do not hold your breath waiting for it there is a red herring killer and then a sadly anticlimactic confrontation with the real killer then it is back to the asylum and roll creditsthe slow pace and numerous inane subplots seem almost calculated to produce a mounting sense of frustration in the viewer which is helped along by choppy editing coffeecan sound quality and dialog that just does not make any sense and the most agonizing thing about this movie is the killers fixation on women  the men in this movie are just so deserving i would have paid good money to see someone off the jerk with the pregnant girlfriend or the lunkhead lothario who was fooling around with his girlfriends roommate or any of the creepy priests there are not no justice,0

frailtyeighttenit is nonsensical title and bill paxton directs headline aside this is a pretty good old fashioned rip snorting biblical horror thriller in the end it may end up only being the inbred southern gothic cousin of kubricks the shiningbut hey that is a pretty damn entertaining notion it is also got a doozy of a plot twistand a very ambiguous moral message this is the kind of movie that years from now people will catch late at night on basic cable and scare the beejesus out of themselves watching it too bad director bill paxton had to go hire himself to staroh wellstill a devil of a good rent,1
the sopranos is probably the most widely acclaimed tv series ever so naturally my expectations were through the roof and yet the show surpassed them i love the mafia and crime genre in film and i enjoy following the compelling stories set in these worlds but this is so much more eightysix hours of material gives the story a chance to not only be one of the most thrilling and unpredictable mafiaaction stories but also to be a great family drama a shocking character study a laughoutloud comedy a brilliant psychological examination dealing with the nature of good and evil and an intellectual arty collaboration of representative dreams and hallucinations all in one david chases epic series manages to accomplish all of this and more and cements hbo as the closest tv can get to cinematic perfection paving the road for a number of other series to continue blowing audiences awayrealism is present when it is needed but chases decisions to depart from it for effect on occasion for dream episodes and the like only adds more layers to the series chasealong with a strong writing staff including matthew weiner and terrence winter future creators of mad men and boardwalk empire respectivelyturns new jersey into an intricate universe full of the greatest cast of characters i have seen on tvjames gandolfini domineers the show as tony one of the most groundbreaking characters on tv ever tony adheres to half of the mobster stereotypes from pop culture but he defies the other half entirely and through his family interactions and his therapy sessions with dr melfi lorraine bracco with whom he has a considerable chemistry that ensures that the therapy scenes always have a completely different feel to the rest of the show we see nearly every side to tony soprano and learn that he is more of an everyman than one would expectedie falco matches the power of gandolfinis performance as tonys wife carmela from her mixed feelings about tonys lifestyle to her suspicions about murders to her torment over tonys cheating to her own thoughts about infidelity carmela runs the gamut of emotions throughout six seasons and falco makes her the prime vehicle for the non mafia viewers to have eyes into such a corrupt world scenes between tony and carmela provide some of the most heartwrenching and painfully realistic drama ever seen on televisionthe supporting cast is almost as phenomenal and a wide array of characters populate the cast over all six seasons somehow without any redundancies nancy marchand steals the show as tonys overbearing mother livia an insight into tonys personality problems and panic attacks the familiarity of marchands incessant complaints is almost gruesome since she takes the character so believably far michael imperioli is christopher tonys protégé whose various poor choices lead him down a road that is painful to watch but brilliantly executed drea de matteo plays christophers girlfriend adriana and is so well meaning and loving that the dark arc her character takes as she gets too involved with christophers career tony sirico is paulie introduced as the ultimate mafia stereotype and a source of comic but eventually he becomes one of the most sympathetic and complex characters on the show and nobody plays true anger better than he and that is just the tip of the icebergfamiliar faces such as peter bogdanovich jon favreau ben kingsley lauren bacall will arnett nancy sinatra david strathairn robert patrick hal holbrook burt young and eric mangini make appearances over the course of the show while names as notable as joe pantoliano steve buscemi and steven van zandt have regular roles as main characters in the series there are fifty great characters with powerful arcs and the excitement and tension never let up in any of the various subplots throughout the showcomedic elements and entire episodes filled with brilliant hilarity dilute the powerhouse dramatic intensity of the series which is so multipurpose that for one reason or enough the credits of nearly any episode left me somewhat bewildered the sopranos is the most powerful and addicting series i have seen overall and its highs are so mindblowing that i would have to call it my favourite show in spite of arguable lows most of which i disagree withwhether you love or hate the ending or what you make of it is irrelevant the discussion it has created is an achievement in itself the iconic nature of the entire series makes it an essential part of television history there are multiple elements for anyone to love and marvel at in this show so if you are thinking of watching something else instead do yourself a favour and fuhgeddaboutit,1

with no affinity towards any type of filmmaking and a healthy appreciation of documentaries i can honestly say i was angry at myself for bothering to sit through the entire length of twenty dates i will not waste your time with the plot you may read other reviews i will say though that berkowitzs hyper woody allenstyle narration was extremely annoying you either wished he would lay off the coffee or ingest some tranquilizers and it is potentially apparent to berkowitz himself that this film was a bad idea as parts of it details his trials to finance the documentary forgive me for disguising insults as compliments but i will give credit to berkowitz for having the skills to convince some idiot to finance this horrid piece of  i appreciate the boundaries  intentions of the film here but even when regarding the standards berkowitz sets for himself he fires off and misses on all levels in closing i am sure many of these female companions were not at ease going on a date with a twitchy want tobe filmmaker and therefore i question the films sense of authenticity hey myles i loved your film the first time i saw it when it appeared as an episode of seinfeld or was a film directed by woody allen or kevin smith,0
when i was a kid i totally loved both bill  ted movies the other night bogus journey was on and since it was at least five years since i last saw it i decided to tune in and i loved it all over again this film is still funny after all those years excellent adventure is better but this one rocks just the same sure some of the perfomances are a bit cheesy but hey this entire film is cheesy in a cool way plus it features the coolest personation of death ever in a movie concluding totally like non bogus movie dude way excellent station,1
cry freedom is an excellent primer for those wanting an overview of apartheids cruelty in just a couple of hours famed director richard attenborough gandhi is certainly no stranger to the genre and the collaboration of the reallife mr and mrs woods the main white characters in their book and in this film lends further authenticity to cry freedom the video now in release actually runs a little over two and a half hours since twentythree minutes of extra footage was inserted to make it a two part tv miniseries after the films initial theatrical release while the added length serves to heighten the films forgivable flaws uneven character development and blanket stereotyping in particular another possible flaw the insistence on the white characters fate over that of the african ones may work out as a strength viewing crying freedom as a politically and historically educational film as i think it should over its artistic merits the story is one which black africans know only too well though the younger generation may now need to see it on film for full impact it is the whites who have always been the films and the books target audience hopefully driving them to change now twelve years after the movies production cry freedom is in many ways a more interesting film to watch almost ten years after black majority rule has been at least theorically in place one thousand nine hundred and eightysevens cry freedoms ideals remain by and large unrealized it therefore remains as imperative as ever for white south africans particularly the younger ones who have only heard of these actions to see it and absorb the films messages in total contrast to american slavery and the jewish holocausts exposure south africans struggles have been told by a mere two or three stories cry freedom cry the beloved country ok count it twice if you include the remake and sarafina did i miss one all three dramas also clumsily feature american and british actors in both the white and black roles not one south african actor has played a major role white coloured indian or black and yes i did miss another international south african drama mandela and deklerk though this also highly recommended biopic was released after black majority rule was instituted mandela was played by a black american sidney poitier who also starred in the original sathemed cry the beloved country while the afrikaner deklerk was played by a bald very british michael caine a good performance if you can dismiss that the very essence of afrikanerdom is vehement antibritish feelings until local sabc tv and african films start dealing with their own legacy cry freedom is about as authentic as you will get as villified as the whites particularly the afrikaners are portrayed in the film any observant noncasual visitor to south africa even now in one thousand nine hundred and ninetynine not to mention one thousand nine hundred and seventyseven when cry freedom takes place will generally find whites attitudes towards blacks restrained even understated looking at cry freedom in hindsight it is amazing that reconciliation can take place at all and it is but cry freedom at time shows not much has really changed in many peoples minds yet and that the black africans goal to freedom and reconciliation is still ongoing this is why if you are a novice to the situation cry freedom is your best introduction,1
this movie is like real life by which i mean  not a lot happens in the available two hours or so and not much game plan or plot is evidenced by the frequently invisible cast their invisibility being due to the experimental lighting as mentioned by many reviewers a big bore no big surprise that altman helms this  he is a very variable performer yes we all loved gosford park but pret a porter anyone kansas city dr t and the women aaargh but the fact that the raw material is a john grisham tale and the excellent cast that you will perceive through the gathering gloaming of your insistent slumber  makes this truly a masterpiece of bad film and no it is not so bad it is goodit is just bad,0
i have seen miracles still happen now at least four times i never tire of this fantastic movie from the very beginning it holds a persons interest as the movie progresses and the plane crashes the story becomes very intense as we watch this young girl trying to survive alone and frightened in the amazon following a plane crash in which she was the only survivor losing her mother in this plane crash as well makes this movie even more dramatic as we see the perils this young girl had to endure during her ten days in the amazon to think this really did happen is just unreal and to think that anyone could actualy survive this is unspeakable as we see the wild animals snakes and other reptiles the enormous forests and wildlife as well as countless insects as the movie progresses we see the many dangers this girl has to face as she tries to follow the river in hopes of it leading her to a town remembering what her father told her about how a stream will always lead to a river and then into an even larger river and this means it will eventually lead to a community this young girl keep track of the tiny stream which eventually lead into a huge river all throughout the movie at times having to swim in dangerous waters alone frightened injured she always managed to keep going towards the end of this movie it was obvious she would not have been able to continue much longer as she had not eaten in ten days and only had water to drink and was very sick and tired from her perils eventually as she sees a canoe she realizes there has to be a village and men find her and they take care of her and then take her to a hospital where her father comes to see her after fearing she was dead along with the many other passengers such a dramatic movie and so heartwarming to see her fathers face when he sees his daughter is actually still alive after all this time in the amazon movies like this are not made much those days i will still see it again and i know i will never tire of it to think this girl was the only one single survivor of this airplane is just unspeakable also the fact she only maintained a few very slight injuries was even more remarkable whereas everyone else on this airplane perished in the horrific crash into the wilds of the amazon a brilliant movie superbly acted out indeed and one i will treasure forever and love to continue watching strongly recommended by me for sure,1
i am not sure if it is available worldwide  but if anyone who is deciding what is supposed to be put on videotapes and distributed in video clubs  is reading this  please  please buy it if i was not clear get the movie into videostorescannot be explained  must see,1
a year or so ago i was watching the tv news when a story was broadcast about a zombie movie being filmed in my area since then i have paid particular attention to this movie called fido as it finished production and began playing at festivals two weeks ago fido began playing in my local theater and just yesterday i read a newspaper article which stated fido is not attracting audiences in it is limited release with the exception of our local theater in fact here it is outdrawing all other shows at the paramount theater including three hundred of course this makes sense as many locals want to see their city on screen or spot themselves roaming around in zombie makeup and for any other locals who have not seen fido yet but are considering it i can say there are many images on screen from the school to city park to the forbidden zone that you will recognize in fact they make the okanagan valley look beautiful that is right beautiful scenery in a zombie movie however fido itself is a very good movie yes despite its flaws it is better then most of the twenty other movies playing in my local market fido is best described as an episode of lassie in which the collie has been replaced by a member of the undead this is a clever premise and the movie even goes further by taking advantage of the one thousand nine hundred and fiftys emphasize on conformity and playing up the coldwar paranoia which led to mccarthyism furthermore it builds on the notion that zombies can be tamed or trained which george romero first introduced in day of the deadksun ray plays a small town boy who is mother carrieann moss longs for a zombie servant so she can be like all the other house wives on her block however his dad dylan baker is against the idea as he once had to kill his own zombie father eventually the family does acquire a zombie named fido played by billy connolly and adjusts to life with the undead billy connolly was inspired casting he is able to convey fidos confusion longing hatred and loyalty through only his eyes lumbering body and grunts connolly shows that he can play understated characters better than his outrageously comedic ones this is his best role since mrs brownfido follows in the footsteps of other recent zomcoms such as shawn of the dead and zombie honeymoon being someone who appreciates bruce campbell and misty mundae movies more than eli roth and jigsaw ones i prefer humor over gore in my horror however i understand the criticism of those horror fans who feel there is not enough undead carnage in fido yet i am sure patient viewers will be rewarded by the films gentle humorthe movie does break down in it is third act it is as if the writers were so wrapped up in the cute premise of domesticated zombies in the one thousand nine hundred and fiftys they forgot about the story arc however given my interest in horror comedies and my appreciation for seeing the neighborhood on screen i rate fido nine out of ten,1
i caught this at a test screening all i can say is whatthehell this movie plays out about as smoothly as mickey mouse reading the script for scarface it is bizarre beyond making the slightest bit of sense and even if you do leave your brain in the car the film is still so bizarre that it is not even funnythe plot involves crocodile hunter steve irwin trying to save a crocodile which contains a cia probe the cia comes after irwin to get their probe back irwin mistakes them for poachers and sets out to stop themthat is about all the story there is the rest is overthetop lampooning of australian culture didja see dat and crikey and strangely choreographed action sequences at one point irwin mounts a speeding rv and knife fights with a cia agent on top of it yes that is right steve irwin knife fights a guy on top of an rv let that be your guide for this ridiculously bad film,0
in my opinion this is a pretty good celebrity skit show i enjoyed seeing greg kinnear as the host there are many reasons why i said that even though hal sparks was an okay host i sometimes wish that greg kinnear had not left if you ask me it seems that nobody stays with a tv show throughout its entire run anymore still i enjoyed seeing the various hosts and other people spoofing celebrities if you ask me that was pretty darn funny before i wrap this up i must say that i kind of miss this show now in conclusion i highly recommend this show to all you diehard sketch show fans you will really enjoy it,1
my abiding love of italian actress lucianna paluzzi who helped jumpstart my puberty with her performance in one thousand nine hundred and sixtyfives thunderball has led me to some fairly unusual places case in point this british curiosity from one thousand nine hundred and fiftynine carltonbrowne of the fo which features lucianna in one of her earlier roles she plays a princess in this one although the picture is actually a showcase for the talents of terrythomas and peter sellers both of whose stars were certainly on the rise at this point in this cute often very funny film we learn of the madeiralike island nation of gaillardia which had been a british colony until one thousand nine hundred and sixteen and then universally forgotten fortythree years later however it becomes the center of worldwide attention and international espionage when valuable cobalt deposits are discovered there and her majesty sends the bumbling carltonbrowne of the foreign office to take charge terrythomas underplays this part nicely as does sellers in his role as prime minister amphibulos of the tiny country this was sellers second film of one thousand nine hundred and fiftynine concerning a tiny country matching wits with the world the other being the mouse that roared of course ian bannen almost steals the show here as gaillardias suave king and my girl lucianna is as appealing as can be in her minor role the film exhibits much in the way of very dry humor although there are some belly laughs to be had the reception at the gaillardian airport for example and especially that may daystyle parade of gaillardian strength and sellers seedy prime minister with his cracked english and seemingly perpetual sweat stains is yet another memorable character in this great actors pantheon despite the occasional instance or two of indecipherable stiffupperlip british gibberish i found this picture to be a winningly modest entertainment and well presented on this crisplooking anchor bay dvd,1
what is good about it some inventive and genuinely creepy little effects that will get under the skin of even the most seasoned horror fan does not rely on the hackneyed soundtrack stabs for its gotcha moments even if you have seen everything there is still a few things in this film that will make your jaw dropwhat could have been better about it the acting was at times flat and unconvincing it had a shotonvideo quality in some places thoughit mostly achieved the atmosphere it was striving for and the camera work is full of needless closeups of meaningless actions though the effects are genuinely creepy i think they may have gone to the well a few too many times with some of them the ending seemed rushed and glossed over what could have been more impactful moments the viewer is left to figure out a lot of things for themselves not as a challenge by the filmmakers but because they just missed itstill a good little indie horror film that is easily several steps above the average well worth the rental,1
bloodsuckers has the potential to be a somewhat decent movie the concept of military types tracking down and battling vampires in space is one with some potential in the cheesier realm of things even the idea of the universe being full of various different breeds of vampire all with different attributes many of which the characters have yet to find out about is kind of cool as well as to how most of the life in the galaxy outside of earth is vampire i am not sure how the makers meant for that to work given the nature of vampires who the hell they are meant to be feeding on if almost everyone is a vampire i do not know as it is the movie comes across a low budget mix of fireflyserenity and vampires movies with a dash of aliensthe action parts of the movie are pretty average and derivative particularly of serenity but passable they are reasonably well executed and there is enough gore for a vampire flick including some of the comical bloodspurting variety there is a lot of character stuff most of which is tedious coming from conflicts between characters who mostly seem like whiny immature arseholes primarily cowboy dude and asian woman there are a few character scenes that actually kind of work and the actors do not play it too badly but it mostly slows things down a nice try at fleshing the characters out but people do not watch a movie called bloodsuckers for character development and drama the acting is actually okay michael ironside hams it up and is as fun to watch as ever and at least of a couple of the women are hot the space sfx are not too bad for what is clearly a low budget work the story is again pretty average and derivative but as i said the world created has a little bit of potential the way things are set up bloodsuckers really does seem like the pilot for a tv series character dynamics introduced the world introduced but not explored etc the film does have a some highlights and head scratching moments the kind of stuff that actually makes these dodgy productions watchable the scene where our heroes interrogate a talking sock puppet chestburster type creature hilarious  the sex scene wtf indeed the credit and michael ironside as muco the most annoying aspect of it all though is the really awful and usually inappropriate pop music they have playing very loud over half the scenes of the movie it is painful to listen to and only detracts from what is only average at bestbasically an okay watch is you are up for something cheesy even if it is just for the chestburster scene,0
movies have put me to sleep before but no movie has ever done that twice so it took me three sittings actually to finish it the dialog was bad women spoke stiltedly and the men were caricatures and two of the supposedly japanese women looked chinese had chinese names and spoke with clearly chinese accents i am still trying to figure out why the emmenthal men were sexually wrapped up with each other ten minus eight onetwo equals a tough choice do i give this movie a rating of one or twomovies have put me to sleep before but no movie has ever done that twice so it took me three sittings actually to finish it the dialog was bad women spoke stiltedly and the men were caricatures and two of the supposedly japanese women looked chinese had chinese names and spoke with clearly chinese accents i am still trying to figure out why the emmenthal men were sexually wrapped up with each other ten minus eight onetwo equals a tough choice do i give this movie a rating of one or two,0
it is obviously illegal pedophiles pray on stuff like this how did they get away with making such a movie this movie is all summed up in one word sick where do people get off making and watching these kinds of films as i was watching the movie i did not actually think they would allow this kid that is say maybe twelve if that actually sleep with this woman sorry if this is a spoiler to you but i would have rater not seen this where has the sanity of these people gone maybe the makers of this movie are pedophiles our society today is filled with all types of sexual predators that pray upon children yet film makers make these types of movies that do nothing but provoke this type of behavior i noticed that on a previous comment someone asked if there was a version where it showed them naked this is a kid here and someone is asking something like this what is wrong with this picture,0
i am a huge fan of the comic book series but this movie fell way below my expectations i expected a heavy metal two thousand kind of feel to itslow moving bad dialogue lots of bloodbut this was worse than anything i could have imagined the plot line is almost the same as the comic but the good points pretty much stop there the characters do not have the energy or spirit that drew my attention in the comic series the movie only covers a small portion of the comic and the portion used is more slow and boring than later parts the focus in the movie is on the insignificant events instead of the more interesting overall plot of the comic bookwith the right people working on this project it could have been amazing sadly it was not that way so now there is yet another terrible movie that few will see and even fewer will love my copy will surely collect dust for years until i finally throw it out,0
if you like gangster type of movies then this is the first one you should buy or at least rent al pacino his performance is top notch and the story is classic ten  ten  why is not this movie in the top two hundred and fifty list,1
while the threed animation the highlight of the show did it is job well most other elements fell flat it was as though the filmmakers thought well it is going to be threed so we do not have to work that hard on the plot or character development and the fact that it is a childrens movie is absolutely no excuse the public is drawn to three dimensional characters shrek nemos dad just as much as they are drawn to three dimensional graphics the only dimension any of the main characters showed was two dimensional scooter who twists the plot from time to time with his compulsion to eat everything in sightand the absolute kicker buzz aldrins appearance at the very end after watching a very robotic cartoon version of the same historical figure for an hour and half comes on the screen and ruins everyone is good time by calling the films main characters contaminants and announcing that the situation put forth on screen was actually an impossibility did you just want to tell the kids the easter bunny and santa claus do not exist while you are at it,0
ariauna albright is a really good actress but why she participated in this lame written travesty is a mystery what could have been entertaining winds up as classic boredom the unique thing about ariauna is that she can act as well as look real sexy as opposed to her partner lilith stabs who looks fine but it is obvious she spent the money for acting school at the spa or beautician this was a production that cried out for some t  a  with a imaginative script writer could have achieved it in the flow of things however ariauna does what she can under the circumstances  to a extent salvages her reputation the tempe company should be aware that when you dress two attractive women in skimpy fetish cop uniforms the viewers will expect some fetish play  t  a nough said,0
it is a strange thing to see a film where some scenes work rather weakly if only in comparison to other films in its legacy and others in a subplot or supporting story are surprisingly provocative and strong sudden impact is one of those cases where clint eastwood as starproducerdirector shows when he can be at his best or at his lessor of times when dealing with a crimemysterydetective story in his dirty harry fame we get that make my day line and unlike in the first film where his do i feel lucky speech was playful and cool the first time and the second time at the end tough as nails here it is switched around he gets into another shamble with the department as usual when he tries to fight crime his way in particular with a diner robbery inspiration for pulp fiction and with a high speed pursuit with a senior citizen bus he is told to take a vacation and that is the last thing on his mind this whole main plot is not very convincing aside from the expectancy of the story and lines which just adds to the frustration but soon his story merges with the subplot that eastwood develops from the startenter sandra lockes character jennifer spencer whom we soon learn after some appropriately mysterious scenes that she and her shy sister were victims of a cruel unjust sexual assault err outright rape and is sleekly undercoverlike getting revenge her scenes and story are the strongest parts of the film the most intense and finally when it goes into callahans storyline he is getting facts in the same small town she is in on a murder the film finally finds a focus between eastwoods classic form of clearly defined good vs evil though sometimes blurred to be sure eastwood films the flashbacks not to say too much about them expertly in a fresh experimental style the trademark lalo schifrin score is totally atmospheric in these scenes and in others it almost seems like a couple of times an arthouse sensibility has crept into eastwoods firmly straightforward storytelling style which helps make the film watchableit is a shame though that in the end it goes more for the expectable or maybe not expectable points and until the third act callahan does not have much to do except his usual it is smithwessonand me shtick however with locke he gets out of her a very good performance more subtle and touching than the one in the gauntlet and an exciting climax at an amusement park in a way i do and do not agree with eberts remark that it is like a music video in eastwoods style here i admit there is comparisons with the simplicity of both the directness but the scenes where eastwood does break form are superior to those of any music video it is cheesy it is hardedged it is not up to par with the first two harry pictures but hey there could be worse ways to spend a couple hours with the master of the fortyfour,1
the sunshine boys was the hilarious one thousand nine hundred and seventyfive screen adaptation of neil simons play about a retired vaudevillian team played by walter matthau and george burns who had a very bitter breakup and have been asked to reunite one more time for a television special or something like that the problem is that the two still hate each other and want nothing to do with each other richard benjamin appears as matthaus nephew a theatrical agent who has been given the monumental responsibility of making this reunion a reality this warm and winning comedy is a lovely valentine to a forgotten form of entertainmentvaudeville and it works mainly thanks to one of neil simons better screenplays and outstanding work by matthau burns and benjamin burns won the best supporting actor oscar for this but i think matthau walks away with this film with his flawlessly hilarious performance as willy clark matthau was nominated for best actor but did not stand a chance against nicholson for one flew over the cuckoos nest however in another year this was an oscarworthy performance matthau commands the screen and there is not a false note in this beautifully timed performance the scene where he is auditioning for a potato chip commercial and cannot get the name of the product right is a classic the sunshine boys is a warm and winning neil simon comedy which shines thanks to unbeatable chemistry between matthau and burns,1
this is a review of the wizard not to be confused with the wiz or mr wizard the wizard is a lateeighties film about a seriously silent boys ability to play video games and walk during the entire opening credits the wiz is an unnecessary update of the wizard of oz and mr wizard is that guy that attached one hundred straws together and had some kid drink tang out of itnow that we have gotten all that out of the way let me say this there is really no reason to see this movie it is simply a one hundred minute nintendo commercial designed to capitalize on the powerglove the legend of zelda and super mario brothers three i use the word designed in the loosest sense possible because it seems like this movie was written over a weekend by a crack team of people who had never played nintendo and directed by a man with less sense of style than my grandmother maybe if the writer and director sat down and actually played some games together they would realize that they were about to film total rubbish and instead go to vocational school to learn how to install car stereosi hope that this has been an enlightening experience for you it sure has not been for me in fact i think i might have lost a few braincells in the act of watching this movie and writing about it next time you are at the video store and you see the the wiz the wizard and the wizard of oz all sitting there on the shelf in a pretty little row give them all a miss and play duck hunt instead,0
one of the most boring slashers ever if you can even call it that i would not watch this if it even ended up being some kind of porno movie which it completely resembles the fact that you are watching a small group of middleaged people in the woods is really unbearable they made these kinds of movies for teens so who were they really aiming for when they made this sleepfest my favorite part of this movie is the cover art and it is the only reason i chose to seek out this movie which happened to be part of a suspense classics fifty movie pack and after seeing the other movies in this fifty pack you will realize that it belongs nowhere else so if you are in the mood for a decent slasher in the woods i recommend just before dawn and the final terror,0
i was very unimpressed with cinderella two and jungle book two but this is possibly worse than both titles first of all i did not like the animation very saturdaymorningcartoon only worse in some scenes i liked some of the characters namely thunderbolt and patch but the other characters like cruella were mediocre cruella was truly villainous in the original but she lost her quality in the sequel what she said was nothing at all to write home about and her animation was kind of ugly also her artist companion lars was a joke to be honest with you and roger seemed to have quit smoking overnight the voice talents were very good though especially barry bostwick as thunderbolt with the exception of jodi benson the accent ruined it for me there were some good moments but the whole plot seemed bloated for me and highly suggestive of an extended tv episode all in all a hugely disappointing sequel to the most memorable of the sixtys disney movies along with jungle book sorry i can only give this a threeten it just was not my cup of tea bethany cox,0
for me this is a story that starts with some funny jokes regarding franks fanatasies when he is travelling with a staircase and when he is sitting in business meetings the problem is that when you have been watching this movie for an hour you will see the same fantasiesfunny situations again and again and again it is to predictable it is more done as a tv story where you can go away and come back without missing anythingi like felix herngren as frank but that is not enough even when it is a comedy it has to have more variations and some kind of message to it is audience,0
ruby in paradise is a beautiful comingofage story about a young woman ruby lee gissing escaping her stifling roots to become herself although the title character is played artfully by the gorgeous ashley judd  in likely her first movie role albeit one to be quite proud of  the emphasis is not upon becoming somebody a la the next madonna whether jesus mother or the lurid attentionhungry singerit instead emphasizes following ones instincts and being somewhat introspective about them to grow into ones ideal adult self note this is not an action movie it uses an occasional voiceover narration by ms judd while writing in her journal  and oh i see i have just lost the male half of the readers out there but be patient with this beautiful movie where we learn that ones bliss can be discovered in  oh i do not know carrying water and chopping woodactordirectorwriter todd field who played nick nightingale in eyes wide shut costars as ruby lees noble love interest one who helps her heal her idea of relationships implanted from youthbut not even his character is the answer for ruby lee there is no external hero imposed upon her the ultimate message is that we are responsible for ourselves writerdirector victor nunez who also wrotedirected ulees gold did an amazing job showing a young woman growing into herself  confronting ageold challenges of good v evil along the waythe supporting cast is also stellar and the music used particularly the cuts by chanteuse sam phillips whom i hear is the wife of t bone burnett is right on  most especially trying to hold on to the earth now when i hear the first few chords of that song tears spring to my eyes pavlovian and unbidden  not sure if it is the music or the indelible connection to the movies quiet charming message of empowermentthis movie is highly recommended for any young person trying to find hisher way for any woman of any age it is a must see the downside it is not on dvd except in spanish we learned however that it is legal to make one copy of a vhs version which can be readily found online my beloved husband found someone with a vhs copy and got a dvd copy made for me although this treasure of a movie occasionally pops up onair  on an indie channel usually  you cannot count on that when you might need it most as a tonic to soothe the pressures of the world so buy a copy for yourselfthis movie should have a major rerelease and it would if i were queen of hollywood figgy jones,1
this is at least the third remake of this movie so if while watching it there is a sense of deja vu do not be surprised all they did was change the setting of the story and tell it differently but the differences are not significant and it does not get any better because the plot is flawed to begin with it never works and like its predecessors the acting is mediocrethe plot has a unique ending which will surprise any one who has never seen the movie before but the ending does not fit the story had this movie ended ten minutes earlier it would have worked and have been very satisfying and i would have thought it more worthwhile but here is the spoiler and that in the end crime does pay because the criminal is not caught i never like this message resulting from a movie,0
at least it is not full of sensless violence or fluff it is also not very full of thought or a smooth storyline this story had some potential but the director appears to have lost site of the green the story is disjointed and goes off in strangedirections to no conclusion i also do not believe the director spent much time around a golf country club either some of the depictions are absurd not very engaging,0
who me no i am not kidding that is what it really says on the video caseplot short version pretty woman stands around smiling this for some reason makes all men kill each otherfind arielwhere is arielcannot find ariel she is right behind you you idiotmost of what can be said about this horrendous little space opera has already been said looks likea bunch of corny actors playing mostly convicts come in after the first selection of actors is knocked off very quickly then they get knocked off in the same way every scene is broadcast nearly fifteen minutes in advance perhaps it was a drawing of straws to see which actors had the most screen time and bigger pay check the alien virushologramvr witchglitch seems physically powerless and does not do a thing why cannot she just stay in the computer instead of doing her teleporting vampire routine actually it would have been more interesting if she had been a vampire or doing more than just standing around looking at people which is all she ever does this is enough to make all the men kill each other go figurethis is not really a space flick there are far more shots of the old western trail one thousand nine hundred and fiftys easy rider trail film noirs night club scene even a jog on the beach in fantasyland none of which has any real depth or even makes any sense the night club scene is in black and white of course worked with the wizard of oz does not work so well here this is probably a good thing as those few shots they do show of space are depressingly silly you will probably cry during those moments especially upon seeing that swirling space ship which looks about three inches longnothing is felt for any of the characters not because they are convicts or have no personality but because they are in serious need of acting lessons except for billy dee williams who really does look depressed and at a loss probably by being in this workthis is one of those movies that when viewed with friends is going to cause some extremely loud silences especially when the nerd throws out his attempt at comic oneliners including the line about frenchkissing a meteor did i hear that right perhaps notthe original virtual reality girls get killed which means nothing as they are not even real to begin with well the other characters are not either but that is beside the point hahawhat is kind of funny is that the scene that graces the video case is some sort of skullhorroralien looking thing green filter added on top of that to give it more of auhgreen look which is actually the android after he gets killed and ultimately has nothing to do with anything else afootanother odd deal i noticed whenever there is an explosion at least on my cheap dvd copy everything becomes highly pixelated i do not mean a little pixelated i mean huge blocks about onesixteenth the size of the screen wow,0
not the most successful television project john cleese ever did strange case has the feel of a first draft that was rushed into production before any revisions could be made there are some silly ideas throughout and even a few clever ones but the story as a whole unfortunately does not add up to mucharthur lowe is a hoot though as dr watson bionic bits and all good lord,1
i loved the original scary movie i am a huge fan of parody it is my favorite form of humor it is sometimes regarded as the most intelligent form of humor the wayans boys seemed to grasp that concept perfectly in the original film then temporarily forgot it when making the sequel i think the wayans are a family of comical geniuses alas even geniuses make mistakesthe movie begins with promise i liked the exorcist parody especially the come on out ma gag now that is wayansquality material but other than that i can only think of two other times i laughed one when tori spelling is seduced in the middle of the night by a spirit then becomes clingy and starts talking about marriage with him meanwhile he is saying it was just a booty call that was kind of funny two the save the last dance parody where the cindy character inadvertently beats up a girl while practicing her new moves but even the shortlived giggles are no match for the sidesplitting laughs of the first scary moviethe rest of the movie is pure trash filled with cheap grossout gags jokes from the first movie which were subtle or implied are magnified and overdone for example in scary movie i several innuendos are made to imply that the character ray is gay this was hilarious but in scary movie ii the whole penisstrangulation scene with ray under the bed was mindnumbing and incredibly unfunny this is the pattern of the whole film shock humor alone does not take a movie very far this was a trend in two thousand and two thousand and one unfortunately as much as it pains me to rate a wayans movie so low i have to give this one a two out of ten,0
what is wrong with you people if you were not blown away by the action car sequences and jessica simpsons hot body then you are majorly screwed in the head of course the film is not a masterpiece i do not think it was aiming to be it was fun and funny i never watched the show when i was younger i only recently saw one episode and when i watched the movie i felt it had the same kind of atmosphere the movie seats were practically shaking and the car sequences were good because it did not bore me and drag out like some of the scenes in twofast twofurious and jessica simpson is plain hot i just wish they had used her more in the action sequences all in all i had a hell of a time watching this and i would go and see it again soon and i will buy it on dvd people enjoy it for what it is,1
this movie was crap with a capital c the opening scene showed promise but that promise was broken shortly after the viewer learns where the plot is goingand the wooden statue morty who was rather creepy in the original film looks plain goofy in this one it was so obviously just a guy in a cheap plastic costume and by the way who else thinks morty is one of the most unscary names on planet earth it ranks right up there with jimmy or fred when it comes to horror value or why not just name the wooden statute henryfreakinkissinger run it is dr kissinger that would be about as scary as mortyand then there is a scene where the hero hits his fathers tombstone witha sledgehammer you might guessa twobyfour someone might venture no he angrily beats his fathers tombstone with a twiga freakin twig but worse than that once the characters walk away the tombstone actually and inexplicably bleeds oh brotherthere is also a native american guy who lives with the main characters grandparents but apparently does nothing except mortymaintenance he perpetuates creepy mortylegends warns those who scoff and even fixes mortys arm when it becomes damaged during a childish prank but for all his respect for and tenderness toward morty does morty give a rats hairy behind nothe movie drags on and eventually several people die in ways that correspond to their worst fears sort of this film is a real yawner do not rent it,0
brokedown palace is the story of two best friends alice and darlene who go on a spontaneous trip to thailand and wind up in prison after being caught with planted drugs in their luggage in this way the movie had the potential to turn into a serious and moving film such as return to paradise but instead the movie chose to focus little on the girls situation and more on their friendshipclaire danes and kate beckinsale both turn in excellent performances and the movie is much more about the interplay between them  the suspicion the jealousy the questioning and testing of their friendship and ultimately the sacrifices made in the name of friendship this movie chooses not to delve too deeply into politics or even into the harshness of prison life which is a bit glossed over and focuses more on these friendship issuesthere were some plot holes here and some parts that just did not seem believable or realistic we did not feel the real fear or hopelessness of their situation as well as we might have and we get very little feeling of life outside the prison walls with bill pullman playing the supposedly sleazy lawyer who actually turns out to have a heart of gold in short this should by all rights have been a much darker movie than it wasbut overall i enjoyed it the acting was good the soundtrack was perfect and the storyline had enough twists and turns to stay interesting worth seeing,1
man i really find it hard to believe that the wonderful alan ball had anything to do with this mess having seen the first two episodes thus far i think i can safely say this show is not going to be on my must see list it is just got so many things working against itnone of the actors cast are particularly good anna paquin as the lead character sookie is just awful i remember her being better in a lot of other things i have seen her in so maybe it is just the writing she is not really much fun to look at either there are moments where to be honest she looks downright ugly the actor who plays bill is marginally better if only because his character is supposed to be sort of wooden and aloof the other actors do their best but with the cliché characters with difficult to perform accents they are given it is a tough job tara is an absolute misery to watch rutina wesley absolutely murders the accent it is like nails on a chalkboard bad almost as awful is nelsan ellis it is difficult to understand what he is even saying sometimes both his character as well as taras also seem a bit racist to me i do not know having a character say whycome on an hbo show that is not the wire just seems a bit odd rounding out the cast so far are sookies doddering grandmother her sex addict brother and the only bit of genius casting i have seen in william sanderson as the sheriffthe story seems to be meandering towards it is destination at this point with no real worry about keeping the viewer interested the romance stuff is very dark shadowsy although this show ups the camp factor from something like those old dark shadows episodes times about ten at times it seemed so campy to me that i just have to assume it was intended to be but unlike a show such as buffy that pulled camp off masterfully this show does not out of place with the campiness is the extreme gore and graphic sex of the show i am not averse to either of these when they are done well as they have in many other hbo shows but here at least they prolonged rough sex scenes involving jason stackhouse seem a bit over the top and pointlessabout the only nice thing i can really think to say about this mess is that i liked the opening title sequence hbo has had a string of bad luck with their shows lately i hope they cancel this after the first season and try to get something better on the air,0
i love this movie jouvet arletty blier carné almost everything has already been said about the movie but there is one detail i would like to she would some light onto no footage of the real still standing hôtel du nord is it still i heard it was to be demolished has been used for the movie  the whole scene has been rebuilt on set the main reason being that they could not stop the traffic on the st martin canal for several weeks,1
presque rien is a story of two young boys falling in love during summer stay by the seaside i do not want to tell the plot because it is not what is most important about this film but you can be sure that it is interesting and original the best part of this movie is the cinematography the visual side of presque rien is so amazing it deserves highest note it leaves you charmed with its beautyas for the plot it is shown in uneven rather complicated way there is no simple chronology nor there are answers to all the questions the film brings but this is what makes presque rien even more interesting i recommend this movie to all the people for whom the artistic side of films is very important and they will not be disappointed,1
films such as chocolat beau travail and others have propelled french director claire denis into the top echelon of the worlds most unique and accomplished filmmakers and her two thousand and four film the intruder lintrus adds to the depth of her portfolio a cinematic poem that conveys a mood of abiding loneliness and loss the film provides a glimpse into the psyche of a man who is deteriorating physically and mentally and who travels to various parts of the globe seeking redemption and peace but finds it hard to come by loosely based on jeanluc nancys memoir of a heart transplant the intruder is a film of such unrelenting opaqueness that even after two viewings it is difficult to describe it in other than subjective impressionistic termslouis trebor michael subor is a man in his seventies who is likely dying of a heart condition and who like the professor in ingmar bergmans wild strawberries attempts to come to terms with the mistakes of his life while he has time it is clear that he is physically rugged and very wealthy but seems emotionally drained and the look on his face is one of quiet resignation though we see only one episode of violence where he gets out of bed in the middle of night to kill an intruder there is a sinister sense about him he might be an intelligence officer a foreign agent or a hit manwhatever the case he apparently is under some kind of surveillance and acts like a man that has been involved in criminal wrongdoing and is only now able to see the consequences facial closeups throughout the movie create a strong sense of isolation he lives with his dogs in a cabin in the jura mountains near the frenchswiss border and has an estranged son sidney gregoire collin whom he has long neglected sidney lives nearby with his wife antoinette florence loiretcaille and their two children in one telling scene he meets up with his father on the street and calls him a lunatic but that does not prevent him from taking his moneywhen the film opens we meet antoinette a swiss border guard who boards a van with a trained dog to sniff out some contraband when she comes home she is greeted by her husband who asks her with tongueincheek if she has anything to declare other than these three individuals the people and circumstances we see during the rest of the film may exist only in louis imagination louis has three women in his life and we meet them all in the films first half hour a pharmacist bambou who prepares his medication a neighbor béatrice dalle who is a dog breeder who refuses to care for his dogs when he goes away on a trip telling him that they are as crazy as he is and a young russian organ dealer katia golubeva who he tells he wants a young mans heartrelentlessly she stalks him throughout the film but it is apparently only in his mind in the last section of the film louis travels to south korea in search of a heart transplant and to tahiti to deliver a gift to a different son one whom he has not seen for many years or perhaps has never seen his heart transplant however appears to be a metaphor for a man without a heart a man whose life has been fascinating but ultimately directionless intruding into other peoples lives with little real empathy the intruder contains a haunting guitar soundtrack by stuart staples of the band tindersticks reminiscent of the guitar riff in jim jarmuschs dead man and gorgeous cinematography by denis regular agnes godardgodard creates memorable images that convey a mood of longing and regret a heart beating alone in the snow an infant in a sling looking up at his father for a good two minutes the babys expression gradually turning from morose to a half smile colored streamers blowing from a newly christened ship a massage in a dark room by a mysterious korean masseuse and the vast expanse of ocean seen from a bobbing ship deck while the intruder can be frustrating because of its elliptical nature denis forces us to respond out of our own experience to understand the images on the screen on a very personal level if there is any theme a hint might be found in the opening that tells us what is revealed piecemeal in the film  your worst enemies are hiding in the shadow in your heart,1
i have watched this movie twice and i plan to see it again it is the movie that puts you in the directors place regarding his romantic relations and the political situation in israel it also makes me cry because of remembering the wonderful time it was and the horrible murder described there it is really worth watching,1
not your typical vamp story not bram stoker or anne rice here a truly original vampyre story these vampyres are genetic mutants who the sunlight do not bother they are pure evil to the film is not perfect many of the actors are clearly amateurs the two leads who play van helsing and rally the vampyre chick are pretty good though the film is intensely violent which may disturb some people also it is loaded with scientific detail that many will find hard to understand and may get bored with i was sold on the clever storyline and the couple good performances no telling how successful this film could be if they had a bigger budget and it got mass distribution,0
it sounds as if it should be a biography of claude monet but it is actually a highly focused story of relationships between three adolescent girls on a french synchronized swimming team there are no parents or teachers to speak of no school and boys are represented by one peripheral figure the hunky francois who enters the story determined from time to time and always leaves confusedpauline aquart is the youngest of the three only aspiring to join the team she so much admires she is kind of odd looking she is not yet out of her adolescent growth spurt and has long bony limbs big feet and no derriere to speak of she is prognathous and sports these plump pursed lips after a while her appearance grows on you and from certain angles she can come to appear enthrallingadele haenel is older  more well more developed physically what a glamorous figure she cuts in her swim suit sauntering around teasing the boys swishing her long blond hair but she is not what she seems or is she i could not quite figure it out the french are long on paradoxes and short on consistency no wonder francois is always sniffing after herthere is not so much ambiguity in louse blacheres character she is on the team too but she is dumpy and plain and sensitive about it and has an intense crush on francois blachere is a good actress and adds to the ungainliness of the character through her performancethe movie deals with the relationships between these three meaning intrigues deceptions hidden feelings and all the rest of what we associate with young girls who spend much time with one another this is of course a tricky topic it becomes trickier during the gradual development of a homoerotic relationship between pauline and adele not that you should expect this to be a soft porn movie the only nudity we see is considerably less than a turn on and what little sex there is under the covers sometimes literallyi do not think i want to get into the plot or into its analysis too much partly because it is suggestive rather than expressed through action partly because it is complex and partly because i am not sure i got it alllet me give an example okay adele is the girl the others envy she is also quite distant and self satisfied on top of that she is apparently schtupping every boy and man in sight if they can be of any use to her at all from the handsome but dumb francois to the bus driver she wants a favor from she brags unashamedly about her expertise in fellatio when pauline approaches her about joining the swim team adele uses her as a lookout during assignations with the guys a superior and selfindulgent narcissist you know but then the soidisant slut takes the skinny pauline under her wing and reveals to pauline that she is still a virgin really yes really pauline begins to draw closer to adele and adele finally confesses that she would like to rid herself of her hymen and she would like pauline to do it for her pauline now drawn sexually to adele performs the task with subdued relish now adele would really like to get it on with a man preferably older and experienced so she takes pauline to a boite where she dances seductively with some guy until she follows pauline to the powder room the two girls stand there staring at one another neither having overtly expressed a sexually tinged interest in the other but adele stands so close that pauline slowly loosens her own reins reaches up and kisses adele on the lips adele steps back smiling and says there now that was not so bad was it and then walks back into the clubthat is a pretty close description of whatever is going on between pauline and adele  but what the hell is going on initially adele treats pauline like an irrelevant child later like a close friend finally like a potential lover  and the minute pauline responds adele walks off satisfied is she using pauline the way she seems to be using men does it satisfy adele to know that she now has another person in involuntary servitude i do not knowi have slighted louise blachere as the third member of the trio the plain and overripe wallflower whose expression always suggests dumbfoundedness but who at least is thoroughly heterosexual and the first of the three to rid herself of that noisome virginity but i have only skipped her for considerations of spaceshould you see it by all means just compare it to the typical american movie about high school kids for men some of whom have never penetrated the female mystique this may give you some idea of what it looks like in medium shot,1
nay sayers of this film are likely bitter from some seriously unrequited love this is a great film for anyone capable of understanding johnny mathiss song or any song from that era bobby darins beyond the sea or stan getzs the girl from ipanema et ali measure films by how many times i have to watch them before i am satisfied chances are had me back a few good timesi also watch the synergy between the cast i thought they worked well togetheropen your heart and let the comedic magic of film transport youalan,1
you can tell they spent five making thisit is a waste of your time ugh there is not anything remotely good about this movie  i do not know why i kept watching it the chick is not hot horrid acting you could do anything and its a better use of your time like watching tv playing shitty video games i feel robbed simply robbed of my time  i have never made a review for a movie before as you can probably tell but this movie i felt like i needed to save the poor souls that are about to watch it and looking on imdb before to see if its decent and looking at the comments there was no action no hot chicks no budget shittttttttttttttty acting it screams bad movie the whole movie is in a room,0
hard to categorize the film  perhaps it is an avant garde spy thriller mother night is a very good vonnegut novel and most certainly one of his easiest novels to adapt into a feature length film the film adaptation is very faithful to the original book the indie approach to how this film was produced is probably more effective than having a big hollywood studio financing it these days i doubt an intelligent novel like mother night would ever get the green light from the big hollywood grindhouses and normally that is too bad but not in this case mother night has tight direction and a solid cast nick nolte who seems to be getting better roles as he gets older still has that everyman persona that allows him to take on a wide range of different characters sheryl lee is beautiful and great as always i always thought she deserved better than she got out of the entertainment industry i guess making your debut as a dead girl twin peakswith little air time is not the choicest of roles even if the tv show becomes a minor phenomenon anyway this film is totally enjoyable and you do not have to read the book to understand the movie in fact given todays geopolitical realities the novels premise may appear dated and some younger viewers with little knowledge of history will be utterly confused by the events unfolding i am talking to you fellow americans who are students and scoring the lowest in the industrialized world in geography history and lord knows what other subjects,1
after perusing the large amount of comments on this movie it is clear that there are two kinds of science fiction moviegoers there are the ones who are well read extremely literate and intelligent they know the history of the genre and more importantly they know to what heights it can reach in the hands of a gifted author for many years science fiction languished in the basement of literature considered my most critic to be little more than stories of ray guns and aliens meant for prepubescent teenagers todays well read fan knows well this history and knows the great authors asimov heinlein bradbury and ellison who helped bring science fiction out of that basement in doing so they created thought provoking intelligent stories that stretched the boundaries and redefined the human condition this well informed fans are critical of anything hollywood throws at them they are not critical for it is own sake but look upon each offering with a skeptical eye as they should as hollywoods record has been less than stellar to these fans the story must take supreme importance they cannot be fooled by flashy computer graphics and non stop action sequences when the emperor has no clothes they scream it the loudestthe second type of science fiction movie goer has little knowledge about the written aspect of the genre look at many of the above comments that state well i have not read the book or anything by this author their total exposure to science fiction is from movies or the scifi channel they are extremely uncritical willing to overlook huge plot holes weak premises and thin story lines if they are given a healthy dose of wiz bang action and awesome special effects they are in effect willing to turn off their critical thinking skills or maybe they never had them for the duration of the movie case in point i robot while supposedly based on asimovs short stories and named after one of his novels it contains little of what asimov wrote and even less of what he tried to tell us about humanity and our robotic creations those of you that will run out and buy i robot will be very much surprisedthis movie is not even based on that story at all the film has enormous plot holes that at some points are stretched to the limits of credulity i will not point them out i will not spoon feed you you need to practice you thinking skills and discover them for yourself the characters which are named after many of asimovs characters do not possess the critical intelligence that was a hallmark of his stories the plot itself with all it is action sequences goes against everything that the author stood for his belief that humanity possesses the capacity to solve problems using their minds not their fists is vital to understanding his vision of the future in short other than the name their is very little of isaac in anything about this movie there will always be those uncritical ie unthinking who will state the movie does not have to be like the book due to the medium movies sometimes require that changes be made but what about a case where the movie never even tried to stay close to the book or books from the start what if all they took from the written work was the title this begs the question why tarnish a great body of work by slapping it is title on your vacuous piece of crap save money and do not buy the rights to the works title it something else do not use the characters names believe me no one will accuse you of plagiarism in fact it will not matter what you title it to the unread moviegoer who accepts everything you throw at him but it will upset those who read who think who are unwilling to simply let you give them a pretty light show i robot like much of hollywoods take on the genre pushes science fiction back down into that basement it lived in years ago hollywood could not do this alone it takes an uncritical mindless audience that will accept puerile dredge like this,0
this film was really eyeopening i have seen this film several times first when i was four and i actually remembered it and then when i was twelve the whole message that the director is conveying is for everyone to wake up and not make the mistake of leaving god out of our everyday lives or just plain going the extra mile to insult hima great movie for nonbelievers and believers alike,1
a film without conscience drifter agrees to kill a man for a mobster for money then they double cross him meanwhile he falls in love with the dead mans wife and without her knowing he is the killer moves in with her then he accidentally kills her when she finds out then in a walking tall kind of heroism he gets revenge on the mobsters who double crossed him the first problem is that by agreeing to take on the murder by hire assignment the drifter loses all sense of sympathy worthiness and heroism we cannot accept any goodness in him and as a result the rest of the has no moral center we just cannot care about that kind of guy and the wife nicely played by the fetching kari wuhrer  the sheriff in eight legged freaks a high class lady who runs a mission for homeless people similarly loses a degree of sympathy by jumping right into bed with the homeless drifter despite her evidently weakened state after the death of her husband and when she finds out he is the guy  what does she do she locks him inside her house as if all houses had locks you cannot open from inside with her and proceeds to berate him stoopid george wendt however is terrific in a role as a beefy thug director stuart gordon did so much better with reanimator and dagon,0
twenty years ago the five years old boy michael hawthorne witnessed his father killing his mother with an axe in an empty road and committing suicide later on the present days michael gordon currie invites his girlfriend peg stacy grant and his best friends chris myc agnew jennifer emmanuelle vaugier lisa ann kelly benson ned brendon beiser mitch maldive phillip rhys and trish rachel hayward to spend the halloween in the country with his grandparents in their farm he asks his friends to wear costumes that would represent their greatest innermost fear and together with his indian friend crow byron chief moon they would perform an ancient indian celebration using the carved wooden dummy morty jon fedele that would eliminate their fears forever the greatest fear of michael is to become a serial killer like his father but something goes wrong and morty turns into his father killing his friendsthe fear resurrection is a disappointing and pointless slash movie that uses the interesting concept of eliminating the greatest innermost fear of each friend before it grows but in a messy screenplay full of clichés there are some exaggerated performances like for example ms betsy palmer others very weak but in general the acting is good unfortunately there is no explanation why the dummy is brought to live further in spite of being surrounded by close friends the group does not feel pain or sorrow when each one of them dies the lowpace along more than fifty minutes could have been used to built a better dramatic situation in the very end michael shows a charm that his father was interested that i have not noticed along the story i do not know whether the previous reference was edited in the dvd released in brazil with eightyseven minutes running time the special effects are very reasonable for a bmovie my vote is fourtitle brazil fear two uma noite de halloween fear two one night of halloween,0
there have been some low moments in my life when i have been bewildered and depressed sitting through rancid aluminium was one of thesethe warning signs were there no premiere even the stars did not want to attend and no reviews in magazines the only reason i sat through the film was in the hope that i might catch up on some sleepnothing in the film was explained the narration was idiotic i cheered at one point when the lead of the film appeared to have been shot then to my growing despair it was revealed that he had not really been shot dampening my joy i sincerely hope all involved in the film are hanged for this atrocity there were some positive aspects mainly unintentional moments of humour for example the scene in which the main character for some unknown reason feels the need to relieve himself manually in a toilet cubicle while telling the person in the next cubicle to put his fingers in his earsmy words cannot explain the anger i feel so i shall conclude thusrancid aluminium for sadists wastrels and regressives only who want to torture themselves,0
i saw this movie about five years ago and the memory of it still haunts me to this day i was fully aware at how awful it was supposed to be going into it so i have only myself to blame but like most i did not believe all the negativity being a sandler fan it just seemed inconceivable one of his movies could really be that bad i figured it was just sandler haters i could not have been more wrongwhat we have here is a comedy that does not contain even one second of anything funny that is actually quite an accomplish you would think in a ninety minute comedy they might have accidentally stumbled upon something even remotely amusing but no it is just horrible it is not so bad it is good its just bad you cannot laugh at how bad it is you can only cry you wait patiently for a joke that will at least make you chuckle but they never comehave you seen the movie the ring where the people watch a video tape and die seven days later if this movie was on the video tape people would die instantly by their own hand and there would be smile on their face as they realize their agony has ended and that would be the first smile since they pressed playyou might be inclined to watch it just to see how bad it is unable to curb your curiosity do not please do not trust me i am doing you a favor there are two types of people in the world those that think going overboard is the worst movie ever made and those that have not yet seen it,0
most war films made in the us during wwii were great fun to watch but suffered from severe gaps in realism because they were being produced more for propaganda value to raise the spirits at home than anything else i am not knocking these films as many of them are still very watchable however because they so often lack realism they are prevented from being truly great films a perfect example was the john garfield film air forcein which a bseventeen nearly singlehandedly takes out half the japanese air force however pride of the marines is a welcome departurescoring high marks for portraying a true story in a reasonably accurate manner when i first saw this film i thought it was not a true story as it seemed way too improbable to be true however after researching further i found that it was in fact rather true to the amazing story of two men who did so much to earn the medal of honor this is one case where real life seemed too incredible to be true,1
i discovered this film after reading the book that inspired it it is not a strictly biographical film it is loosely based on the facts but i found it a compelling and eerie exploration of evil and madness and michel serrault gives an unforgettable performance as dr petiotthere are many memorable images in this movie petiot traveling through the night like a vampire his black cloak flapping behind him is almost iconic there are also several touches of expressionism  petiots crooked silhouette mounting the stairs leading from the cellar where the butchered remains of his victims await cremation reminds me of some scenes from nosferatubut i found the primary appeal of this movie to be aural the soundtrack is loaded with ominous sounds starting with the foreboding music of the opening credits accompanied by wordless wailing petiot lives and runs his medical practice in a complex with many small shops and there is a persistent background noise of knives being sharpened somewhere as well as a peddler playing eerie tunes on a saw there are animal noises as well  the concierge keeps a goat unseen cats howl  and later in the film we see hapless cattle being herded through an underpass the whole atmosphere is unsettling with overtones of violence and slaughternot only animals but human voices are often heard  the screams of gestapo victims petiots patients in his waiting room monitored by a listening device just the same as the suspected collaborators after the war are monitored in their cells even the action of the film is often arranged so that we hear the voices of the participants without seeing them  when petiot goes to see mme kern we hear her singing as she works her voice echoing in the theater before we ever see her and even when she does appear she is often filmed from behind her voice calling out to her husband whose voice calls out to her in conversation disembodied voices echo in large halls and their owners when seen at all are photographed at a distance so we cannot actually see them speaking this is a ghost story and these are the voices of ghosts  many of them petiots future victimsyet petiot himself is often only a voice his frightening laughter echoes as he retreats from the camera throwing comments behind him or into the air to nobody in a way he is as much a ghost as those he murders he is always frantically busy scurrying from appointment to appointment never at rest but his activity is that of a machine  lifeless and imperturbable it is interesting that among all the horror and danger of occupied paris petiot alone is unafraid he is amused enthusiastic angry irritated contemptuous but never afraid unlike those real people he lures to their deaths it is no surprise that he boasts of his mechanical inventions including a perpetual motion machine a true detail from the book  he did claim to have invented many machines he is a sort of perpetual motion machine himself and mechanical imagery is everywhere in the film from the opening giant wheel in the movie house to petiots bicycle with its squeaking wheels echoing the sound of sharpening knives to the victrola he keeps winding up to play music before he makes a kill even his routine with his victims is mechanical  write a note to your wife let me disguise you before you leave you need a vaccination barcelona casablanca dakar  like a welloiled machine the routine is always the same just as the record is always the samemaeder the author says that it was the clockwork perfection of his crimes that weighed so heavily against petiot at his trial his system was as smooth and efficient as a nazi concentration camp and this may be why the movie invents a subplot of petiots involvement with the french gestapo and the occupying nazis unfortunately it does not quite work as part of the story because it is very hard to figure out just what petiot is doing for the collaborators or what is going on when he ends up at their headquarters in the middle of the night disposing of bodies hiding stolen goods it is hard to say and harder to believe it is not likely the state would turn to a freelancer like petiotbut it does remind us of the duality of evil people petiot is a robber and a murderer but he is also a devoted father and husband just as we learned that hitler loved dogs and that nazis guilty of the worst war crimes could also be loving fathers and family men so we have to recognize that petiot could commit unspeakable horrors and yet also function normally his insanity is easily camouflaged by the insanity and horror of the wartime situation in paris when killing robbing and disappearing are happening all around nobody pays attention as petiot tosses more corpses on the pile,1
there is no artistic value in this movie to deserve any award well it does not deserve an audience as well ironically one of the awards is for cinematography but frankly the camera movements are disconcerting to say the least every frame you feel you are getting the full picture its like someone is cropping your view from the edges the story is pathetic well i will be honest i could not bear to watch the entire movie the part that sucked the most was when i saw the soldiers partying in their barracks and one of the soldiers coaxed to drink liquor these and many other similar scenes reminded me so much of steven seagaltake my advice stay away from this piece of crap,0
the prerequisite for making such a film is a complete ignorance of nietzches work and personality psychoanalytical techniques and viennas history take a wellknow genius you have not read describe him as demented include crazy physicians to cure him a couple of somewhat good looking women have his role played by an actor with an enormous mustache have every character speak with the strongest accent show ridiculous dreams include another prestigious figure who has nothing to do with the first one freud mention a few words used in the genius works overdo everything you can particularly music and you are done audience please stay away,0
i happen to be the directors nephew it is taken me years to get my hands on a copy of this film and i can confirm that it is indeed one of the worst movies of all time my uncle does not even have a copy of it anymore i asked i am looking forward to bringing him a copycurrently the films average rating is onenineten as far as i can tell that should put it somewhere in the midthirtys in the imdb bottom one hundred however with only two hundred and six votes it has not yet placedit is sad that the film does not even get the respect of a bottom one hundred titleanyhow i am giving copies of the movie to family members this year for holiday gifts bestworst gift ever,0
while originally reluctant to jump on the bandwagon of watching lost i accidentally caught one episode at the beginning of season onethe one with the polarbearand it has had my undivided attention ever since the show that is not the polar bear so bear heh with me while i throw out as much rambling semicoherent praise as i can musterlost takes a simple idea of a passenger flight full of people crashing onto a desert island and gradually adds extraordinary depth to its premise by exploring each character deeply and unflinchinglywhat drives them who are they where did they come from it soon becomes clear that the island upon which they are stranded acts as a common denominator for many things in their lives whether they are running away from something sawyer and kate among others or getting in touch with spirituality locke claire but lost also zooms in on the island itself and the mysterious horrors that it houses and they all seem to be strangely connectedwhile television actors are not exactly known for their subtlety or dazzling acting abilities most of the cast of lost are in truth spectacular actors for their respective parts projecting heart and humour in their performances there is also a multitude of eyecandy but not generally of the plastic hollywood kind as most tv shows the characters all feel very real and they are extremely compelling to watch their interactions rarely fall prey to predictable sappiness petty arguments or cheesy melodrama although they are annoyingly secretive  these people are first and foremost trying to survive and whatever relationship appears is treated secondary to action the realism of these characters facilitate an already wellsculptured plot about this plot imagine a tree as the template plot then the branches as subplots in this case one branch for every character  well lost adds twigs to each branch and then tiny twigs to those twigs as other story lines if you are a brothersister to one of the main characters in the flashbacks you will get your own storyline if you are a dog you will have your own storyline unless the writers manage to weave them all together into some glorious culmination in the end they are setting themselves up i am more than a little worried there will be some disappointing copout to this show as i am sure most people arebut assuming the writers do pull this off lost is possibly the best show ever to hit televisionnineten,1
i caught this film late on a sat night sunday morning with my brother we had been drinking this is one of the best films for ripping apart i have ever seen from the luxury ocean liner actually being a roll on roll off ferry complete with cast iron everything to the doors with adhesive stickers saying staff then seeing the same door being used for something else in another scene  this film rocks the continuity is so poor you cannot help but notice it it slaps you in the face with the holes in the final scene he jumps off a life boat with the ferry in the distance cut to his son and new girlfriend the ships pr director who knows kungfu and used to be in the police but was dismissed for doing things her way  trueon the ferry going very fast away from the explosion then the dad is there hugging them how who cares its magic there is not one redeeming feature to this film the casino is the size of a large bedroom with one casino table when being chased by the villains there is only one place to hide you have guessed it enter the villains who instead of checking under the one table proceed to shoot up four fruit machines and a little corner bar a corner bar in the casino  fantastic they walk straight past the only hiding place thus allowing our casper to get around them and take them outget some mates over get a few drinks in put this film on and howl,1
murders are occurring in a texas desert town who is responsible slight novelties of mystery and racial tensions the latter really does not fit but otherwise strictly for slasher fans who will appreciate the gore and nudity which are two conventional elements for these filmsdana kimmell of friday the thirteenth part three infamy stars as the bratty quasidetective teenonetwo out of mpaa rated r for violence and gore nudity and some language,0
although it is an r rated movie i really doubt that you will really enjoy it unless you are a teenagerwhy because there is no real plot no character developmentno funny jokes the only thing that this movie has plenty of is nudity tons and tons of naked or almost naked chicks pretty nice ones i might add to feast your eyes oni really cannot understand why this movie has the american pie title since it is only a bad combination between an erotic movie and a comedy without succeeding in being either of themmy suggestion is to watch this movie only if you want to see some naked chicks but you are too shy to rentbuy an erotic movie gave it oneten for the two smiles i had in the entire movie and another twoten for the nice chicks,0

this early adam sandler film could be compared to his life as a comic during the same period in one thousand nine hundred and eightynine his characters constant acknowledgement of his hidden comic genius and frustration regarding humorous material seems to come more from sandler than the script the film is nothing compared to his blockbuster feature films such as big daddy or even the corny billy maddison unfortunately sandler had not yet found a way to express himself in a consistent successful and funny manner when this film was made much like his character the majority of the films jokes come from sandler having conversations with himself usually over his unrecognised comic talent and beating himself up because he is too ugly and cannot get women the film is hard to watch too because it does not treat itself like a real film sandler talks to the camera and the viewers throughout the film often referring to the films low budget or questionable content the film is ultimately awkward and embarrassing to watch i immediately wanted to forget i even saw this film after it was over for fear that if more found out about it it would ruin sandlers career pass this one up at the video store i rented it for free and it was still a waste of time,0
anyone who actually had the ability to sit through this movie and walk away feeling like it was a good film does not appreciate quality movies this movie was an insult to watch the direction was high school film class quality as well as the cinematography the blair witch project had better cinematography and i hate that move with a passion the storyline had the potential to be a very intense very good movie but it fell flat from the first ten minutes through the rest of the movie someone mentioned that this film was about a childs imagination okay that is all good and fine but they still could have done better things with this script than what they did i mean come on the indian in the store did the kid look at the little idol and suddenly imagine the indian and the entire story about an indian spirit called wendigo which they mention to the store employee and she casually says there is no one but me that works here so you think okay creepy ghost scenario but then she just barters for the amount on the idol and we forget about the little kid seeing this guy that was so lame it goes beyond pathetic the ending left you wondering not only what happened to otis in the hospital but also with the feeling of omg why the hell did i just waste my time watching this this is a move that i recommend not to watch there are definitely better quality films out there that will not insult your intelligence thank god i never had to pay to see this movie i would have demanded my money back for those that were easily entertained by this movie it is very sad that you lowered your standards to this level of film making to actually say that it was a good movie,0

if you loved deep cover you might like this film as well many of the poetic interludes fishburne recites in deep cover are from the lyrical script of once in the life a screen adaptation of a play that fishburne wrote if you love larry as much as i do you will love this film that is all larry all hot and all fleshed out of course there is gun play and illicit substance use this is a gangster movie of sorts after all but the script is beautiful and the story is touching even a little on the chick flick sideamazing filmdark frightening sexy and exciting if you ever sneaked out at night or hung out in a clubhouse you will get the proper impact of the cramped sets metephorically echoing being trapped in the life full of clever foreshadowing and complex relationships this film is tightevery sentiment mirrored in the set dressing and camera shots good work,1

somewhere out there there must be a list of the all time worst gay films every made ones that have overlong camera shots of the stars sitting and staring pensively into space or ones where they focus unbearably long on kitty kats eating spaghetti this motion sickness picture is a story of a boy and a boy and they live and love and swim and get stuck in grottos and one of them has a depressed mother and another has no mother and they talk and walk and swim and have sex and get drunk and then break up and someone goes to the hospital for eight days and then gets out and there is a lot of fast forward and rewind and there are long pensive shots of one of them looking into space or just sitting and doing nothing i think it is some sort of gimmicky film making technique or maybe it is that the film is so bad they have to fill it up with long wasted shots because otherwise if they had to rely on plot or story the film would be about fourteen minutes do not get me wrong this is about the thirtyth gay film ive watched in the past six months and some of them most of them have been very formulmatic predictable and boring but this is one is really a terrible waste of time the best one so far was beautiful thing so i watched this and after the very first opening shot which lingered and lingered i thought oh no its going to be creative sinny mah but i gave it a chance and watched it and then when it ended i tossed the dvd in the trash sorry i did not like it and if you did sorry if i offend,0
if there was anything akira kurosawa did wrong in making dodeskaden it was making it with the partnership he formed with the four knights the other three being kobayaski ichikawa and konishita they wanted a big blockbuster hit to kick off their partnership and instead kurosawa arguably the head cheese of the group delivered an abstract humanist art film with characters living in a decimated slum that had many of its characters face dark tragedies had he made it on a more independent basis or went to another studio who knows but it was because of this among some other financial and creative woes that also contributed to his suicide attempt in one thousand nine hundred and seventyone and yet at the end of the day as an artist kurosawa did not stop delivering what he is infamous for with his dramas the strengths of the human spirit in the face of adversity that its backdrop is a little more unusual than most should not be ignored but it is not at all a fault of kurosawasthe material in dodeskaden is absorbing but not in ways that one usually finds from the director and mostly because it is driven by character instead of plot there is things that happen to these people and kurosawas challenge here is to interweave them into a cohesive whole the character who starts off in the picture oddly enough though thankfully as there is not much room for him to grow is rokkuchan a brain damaged manchild who goes around all day making train sounds the clicketyclack of the title only sometimes stopping to pray for his mother but then we branch off there is the father and son the latter who scrounges restaurants for food and the former who goes on and on with sitespecific descriptions of his dream house an older man has the look of death to him and we learn later on he is lost a lot more than he will tell most people including a woman who has a past with him a shy quiet woman who works in servitude to her adoptive father or uncle i am not sure who rapes her and a meek guy in a suit who has a constant facial tick and a big mean wife to those who are social aroundthere are also little markers of people around these characters like two drunks who keep stumbling around every night like clockwork putting big demands on their spouses sometimes unintentionally swapping them and there is the kind sake salesman on the bike who has a sweet but strange connection with the shy quiet woman and of course there is a group of gossiping ladies who squat around a watering hole in the middle of the slum not having anything too nice to say about anyone unless it is about something erotic with a guy first to note with all of this is how kurosawa sets the picture it is a little postapocalyptic looking not of any particular time or place that is until in a couple of shots we see modern cars and streets it is a marginalized society but the concerns of these people are however in tragic scope meant to be deconstructed through dramatic force like bergman kurosawa is out to dissect the shattered emotions of people with one scene in particular when the deathlylooking man who has hollow sorrowful eyes sits ripping cloth in silence as a woman goes along with itsometimes there is charm and even some laughs to be had with these people i even enjoyed maybe ironically the little moments with rokkuchan specifically with kurosawas cameo as a painter in the street or the awkward silences with the man with the facial tics but while kurosawa allows his actors some room to improvise his camera movements still remain as they have always been patient but alert with wide compositions and claustrophobic shots painterly visions and faces sometimes with the stylization of a silent drama meant as a weeper amid these sometimes bizarre and touching stories with some of them ie the father and son in the car especially sad kurosawa lights his film and designs the color scheme as his first one in eastmancolor like it is one of his paintings lush sprawling spilling at times over the seams but always with some control this place is not necessarily lighter it is like the abstract has come fullthrottle into the scene where things look vibrant but are much darker underneath it is a brilliant tricky doubleedged sword that allows for the dreamlike intonations with such heavy duty dramawith a sweet movie score toru takemitsu also responsible for ran and some excellent performances from the actors and a few indelible scenes in a whole fantastic career dodeskaden is in its own way a minor work from the director but nonetheless near perfect on its own terms which as with many kurosawa dramas like ikiru and red beard holds hard truths on the human condition without too much sentimentality,1
as a pokémon fan i enjoyed this movie very much it introduces new legendary pokémon as each movie does and adds depth to the relationships between its characters i however do not expect those who are not pokémon fans to enjoy itthis includes most adults some of the lines were corny but that can be somewhat unavoidable when dubbing the movie over to english the animation was beautiful although there were a couple parts that did not look good and although the villain is kind of corny i think that the movies have done a good job of cycling through different types of villains and i guarantee you that they are not all like this one those who did not like it i say to each his own but pokémon fans will love it,1
what happens when an army of wetbacks towelheads and godless eastern european commies gather their forces south of the border gary busey kicks their butts of course another laughable example of reaganera cultural fallout bulletproof wastes a decent supporting cast headed by l q jones and thalmus rasulala,0
this is the definite lars von trier movie my favorite i rank it higher than breaking the waves or the latest dancer in the dark i simply love the beauty of the picturethe framing is so original acting is wonderful a must see,1
i think the comments regarding the show being cheesy are a bit too exaggerated when a person comes to watch a tv show what does he look out for it is to enjoy that he watches a show unless heshe is a critic or a person who analyzes story but most of us are not so and watch the shows to relax and enjoy full house is an ideal show to watch after having a heavy day in the officeschool it makes you laugh and it is not just humoryes the tanner family is a perfect family a perfectly hypothetical family if any such family existed in real world it would be a role model for us to follow but this is a tv show and not a real family and there is nothing wrong in depicting a hypothetical family on television the very fact that the show could run so long shows us that people enjoyed watching it whatever be the comments later onanother good point about the show is that any person of any age would not only enjoy watching it but would take back a message however childish that message be those jesses talks with michelle are extremely touching if one does not think of it as childishoverall i would say after watching every show of full house there is a contentment in your heart that is rarely present after many other shows,1
having been forced by my children to watch this at least ten times for each of the last two christmases i feel adequately qualified to pass judgment on this version of dr seuss classic tale and well it is not very good first off following a classic act like chuck jones animated tv special is going to be difficult for anyone but this interpretation is so heavyhanded and padded as to be positively numbing i will concede that there are a handful of inspired gags but overall the film comes off as a calculated cash grab at the same time as it is supposedly decrying the commercialisation of christmas jim carrey is typically over the top here but that is completely at odds with the character of the grinch as characterised by boris karloff he was a slow burn methodical and sly there is no method to carreys madness and that is only the most obvious error made talented actors like jeffrey tambor and christine baranski are utterly wasted here why universal why i mean  i understand that tony hopkins will take just about any role offered much like his countryman michael caine but this one needs to be filed under films that should never have been made this does not bode well for the cat in the hat an even thinner tome that universal is prepping for this christmas i get the feeling that i will be making the same recommendation for that one as i am with this one skip it and either read the book or watch the tv special this is two hours you can never ever get back,0
not only was this the most expensive canadian film ever shot in because but easily the worst never seeing the light of day the director is not even canadian but british and boy does it show we are all made out to be a bunch of oversexed dope fiends and morons the spirit of what it means to be canadian is absent and this is supposed to be the reason we fund this bunk of course the british character is normal the rest are a crop of sitcom stereotype  can you say norm the cinematography ranges from pretty postcard images to murky indoor silhouettes the actors always seem to be fidgetting are they as bored as the viewer or is this the directors idea of cinema avoid this mess and check out some of bruce mcdonalds films a true canadian boy with something original to say cinematically you will not be compelled to walk out on his films after ten minutes,0
this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen i saw it at the premiere at sxsw and was extremely disappointed the director knew little about john lennon and even said as much at the premiere this is a drama but people were laughing throughout at how cheesy the film was that is never a good sign the only saving graces were dominic monaghan and jason leonard as liviens roommatesbandmates they were funny while the rest of the movie took itself waaay too seriously the cheesy dropping of beatles lyrics was just absurd the soundtrack was excellent however and was probably the best part of the movie unless you are one of those crazy rabid dominic monaghan fans do not bother with this one,0
fear of a black hat is a superbly crafted film i was laughing almost continuously from start to finish if you have the means i highly recommend viewing this movie it is by far the funniest movie i have had the pleasure to experience grab your stuff,1
why on earth should you explore the mesmerizing nature documentary earth how much time do you have on earth so i can explain this to you ok i will not elongate my review exploration on earth to infinity but i must stand my ground on why this is a must see the documentary takes a nature round trip on the migration paths on three animal families a female polar bear and her cubs with the real life subplot of the father bear daring it out to hunt for food in his isolated path a mama of a whale with her baby whale taking a whale of a migration tour for prey and an elephant mama with her small maybe not so small they are elephants offspring migrating in africa directors alastair forthegill  mark linfield did an out of this earth job in also capturing the survival skills of many other animal species besides the magnetic shots of our three animal family protagonists the cinematographically skilled team of richard brooks burton mike holding adam ravetch and andrew shillabeer were animales in camera shooting the wondrous nature sites and animal instinctive behaviors not to mention the slomo animal prey shots were you n b e l i e a v a b l e earth is also a lesson learner on the global warming effect on the animals the papa polar bear in the doc is the poster animal boy on that consequence so fellow earthlings it is time to take the documentary voyage to visit earth today  good,1
the romance of the movie which is also its main theme is good and nicely presented however the surrounding of the love story is too lyric graphical and unrealistic even worse the psychology of the main character is weird and incomprehensible exactly like the end of the movie do not hesitate to watch this movie if it attracted your interest but do not expect too much of it either,1
i´m not surprised that even cowgirls get the blues if this movie is anything to go by i expected something better from uma thurman which was the reason i suffered my way through this experience in the first place an awful film with only the music as a redeeming quality it´s just a shame that we are incapable of giving zero out of ten in these reviews this movie deserves it,0
this is a bit long two hours twenty minutes but it had a a lot of the famous pearl buck novel in it in other words a lot of ground to coverit was soapoperish at times but had some visually dramatic moments too capped off by a locust attack at the end of the film that was astounding to view considering this film is about seventy years old the specialeffects crew on this film did a spectacular jobpaul muni and luise rainer were awardwinning actors in their day and they do not disappoint here both giving powerful performances the only problem is credibility as all the asians are played by caucasions and some of them like walter connolly just do not look real i would like to see a remake of this movie with allasian actors not for pc reasons but to simply make the story look and sound more credible,1
thomas clay has been mixing with the wrong types that is the trouble with young people these days they have no respectseriously this film should be avoided at all costs the action in the main body of the film is slow and rather stodgy and ambles to the drug crazed ending as if like it is director it has no where better to go we are introduced to the main title character who is a bit of an outsider we see him at school and at home not quite fitting in feeling awkward in himself as so many adolescents do robert falls in with bad lads and starts missing school and taking drugs and before you know it he is a psycho rapistthe film is really about clays total failure to understand the links between violence imagery and violent acts clay seems to think a generation of crazed youth are made evil by scenes of war on our tvs yet he has filmed the most disgusting piece of simulated violence is this guy for realif clay has not seen youtube perhaps he is naive and unaware of will be done with the brutal climax scene from his film all anyone will want to see is the most hideous scene from the end of the film and i am sure that will be what sticks with people the rest of the film is pointless for in committing such an act of violence to film clay not only damns young people who are actively engaged in preventing war he also damns himself as perpetrator of extreme tasteless violence for no better reason than his own personal celebrity statusshame on all involved,0
emily watsons natalia is absolutely the most loving and romantic lead character i have ever seen on a screen she is the queen of this film beyond all doubt or is she transmuted to the king the internecine weaving of the chess games and the families struggles for control power and victory is stunning just as the chess masters in the film do the director is playing many simultaneous games with our mind at once but all weave into either major or minor patterns the period the costumes and imagery of early twentyth century italys lake district is captured magnificently not a single square of space is wastedso many brilliant scenes abound i cannot recount them all i recommend budgeting enough time to watch this movie twice possibly a week apart because you cannot possibly capture all the poetry within a sixtyfoursquare yet multidimensional framework in one setting i did not read nabakovs book but to try an analogy of my own what i am reading reminds of me of another romantically triumphant poetryasgame movie barry levinsons the natural it totally jettisoned the downbeat ending of bernard malamuds fatalistic book in favor of a romantic impressionism that was uniquely american well the director did that one better by seamlessly meshing russian and italian morals and mores as a backdrop to enlightenment the true story here is that games are zerosum there is a winner and a loser unless both contestants draw but in life and especially in the context of our immortal souls we are only limited by those constraints and lifes conventions to the extent we let others break our spirit pure love as personified by emily watsons natalia can transcend and allow all of us to be enhanced by its gifts simultaneously only the barriers erected by our fears can cut us off from itthis is a magnificent movie tenten,1
this apology for a movie is about absolutely nothing rachel griffiths must have needed the money the film must have been made on a very low budget because the lighting was non existent i made a vow if i ever see pete postlesumthingor other i will commit suicide i would be happy to know if there was one a plot or twoa script my biggest regret is i wasted my time watching this rubbish,0
can you say all shock no plot there were so many unexplored directions in this movie there was no history about the room other than the deaths why was it evil what made it that way why an hour countdown then there were the unexplored things hinted at for example we saw a camera in the air vent which he mentioned but when he climbed up said vent there was no camerahow about the fact that all the ghosts looked digital and things winked out before hitting the ground making a static noise hmmm when you put all of those things together it makes room one thousand four hundred and eight look like a hightech spook house except that there was no follow up on thatoh by the way electronics do not work in one thousand four hundred and eight well except for the tv the cell phone has no signal but wireless internet works fine how many incontinuities can you possibly add i am sorry but this film was nothing but shock after shock it is all been done before reflections in the mirror things just out of site changing paintings bleeding walls the oh it was all just a dream no it was not and if the room was evil why make our main character come to terms with his daughters death if it was going to keep him trapped there forever anyway it just did not make senseadditionally there was no background information about the first book that he wrote just some vague information about the dad was a jerk and so forth speaking of dads what was with the bit about his father you will be in my placeoverall a truly horrible movie it was one hundred adrenalin shock factor without any new or innovative effects and certainly no back story character development etcmy overall impression is that the entire movie was made on the cheap pretty much using one set and a couple of location shots and was nothing but an effects film of recycled cheesy seenthatbefore effects,0
watched this with my girlfriend after stumbling over it while zaping channelsi guess we both hoped for some kind of happy family cute christmas movie but were extremely disappointedthe actor playing the soldier seems to have zero emotion whatsoever his face looks the same whether he is chopping down christmas trees seeing the girl he loves being kissed by her boyfriend or when he is happily surprised by the girl he loves he is an awful actor and at no pont did any of us do nothing but laugh at himthen there is the cute blond girl blessed with the ability to count dots and cheat on her boyfriend what a catch and her ambition in life is to live with her parents and count more dotsso it is basically a story about a guy without any emotion or feelings who falls for a guy who count dots and cheats on her boyfriend it is as predictable as it gets and really a waste of time you gain nothing by watching this other than some weird laughs because it is all so cornyi love it when her dad says that he only eats french fries and not french wine and they all laugh that is the hillbilly attitude this movie is about furthermore if my girlfriends dad were bossing me around like i would tell him a thing or to but not our army veteran no sir he let us everyone boss him aroundthe movie is what first blood would have been if john rambo were burn like the biggest wimp in the world,0
i may very well be one of the few who really stuck to this film i also saw this movie when it came out and i agree with the last post that up the acedemy was way ahead of its time the humor in the film itself is pure mad magazine i do not see why mad stand behind this feature it was also one of the few films of the early eightys to have a killer accompanying soundtrack with the punk and new wave bands that were emerging from la at the time i own the soundtrack and i play it constantly to this day what can i say there are definitely worst movies out there i do not consider porkys to be as funny as up the academy there are some really good laughs throughout the film and the jokes fall on either stereotypes or getting laid hey nobody said this was going to be the maltese falcon,1
i am not a john cleese completist although i thought fawlty towers was brilliant but i am a fan and when i saw this sitting neglected on a shelf at my local blockbuster i decided to give it a try what i got was a wonderful surprise and one of the funniest fifty minute viewing experiences i have ever had the writing is typical english goon show schtick in fact as an audio skit this would not be out of place on a firesign theater album but the execution and timing is spot on and this elevates strange case into the kind of jawdropping performance that can create lifelong british comedy fanatics the brits have a gift for combining broadly satirical lampoons with closely observed tics of character and timing and the creators use both to good effect here cleeses portrayal of holmes seems to owe much to the arkins and sellers inspector clouseau however cleese has such a knack for physical comedy that he more than holds his own but the unexpected treat here is arthur lowe who plays watson as an genial but invincibly uncomprehending imbecile with such superb timing and delivery that he becomes the best aspect of the film i would never heard of lowe before this his background seems to be vaudeville and musical theater but he justifies his entire career with this performance as far as i am concernedsome people might not care for strange case especially if british whimsy is not their cuppa tea but i am extremely glad i got to see this before it vanished from sight,1
remember the early days of pay per view i do and i can almost remember the number you had to call to actually rent the movie on your tv as a kid we always wanted to rent playboy but this meant actually calling someone from ppv and asking to rent it and then you get the nerve to do it and your watching four hours of soft core no angle crap well the reason i bring that up is because this movie too was on ppv and i remember almost every scene that was in the add i have been on a kick in the last few years to obtain all the great movies i use to see as a kid and this was one of them it is one that when its on its hard to shut off all star cast trying to commit the perfect bank bust but nothing goes right there are plenty of spoof bank capers that are good and this one has to fall in that category it has enough action and laughs to sustain it check it out if you dare,1
i mean really this is not going to help the australian film industry to make this kind of film with no values of any kind okay if you are a stoner and have nothing better to do then maybe i think filmmakers from here should try to show the rest of the world what great talented people we have and this is not the vehicle for it come on now this film is just tacky,0
first off i never considered myself an uwe boll hater since i think i never even saw one of his movies but after seeing this cheap excuse for a movie named seed which is the name of the serial killer this movie is about i am close to joining the hate club this movie makes absolutely no sense at all the plot is a joke and although boll clearly tries to get attention by shocking people ninety of this movie is just plain boredom you can sum up this movie like this one hooded killer watches clips of animals getting tortured on tv this is real life footage from pelt farms and the movie opens with the ridiculous reason of making a statement about humanity and giving a peta address since this movie has no message at all and is the worst piece of torture pornexploitation you already have a reason to hate the movie from the beginning onwardtwo death by electrocution with a pretext that gives away what happens later in this movie printed on screen so every retard gets itthree cops watch videos of animals babies and women starved to death and decomposing in seeds basement having stupid nightmares and crying into their whiskey because seed is such an evil bad mofo although the acting is ok the movie takes a dive every time it tries to incorporate any emotions four cops bust seed in his house act stupid and get slashed in the dark this sequence reminds me of a video game you barely see anything except flashlights seed is a super killer that is everywhere at once and all cops act stupid enough to be killed except for one who busts himfive seed gets the chair and we see his electrocution as lengthy as everything else in this movie he will not die and we are reminded of the opening statement that he must be set free if he survives three electric jolts guess what they just bury him alive to solve the problemsix seed comes out of his grave kills everyone off in another slashing part and then seeks the main cop to take revenge onseven a woman gets her head bashed in with a hammer in an endless sequence from one point of view just for the fun and shock value of it eight seed captures the cops family lures him to his house threatens to kill his wife and daughter after killing his wife with a nail gun the cop shoots himself in the head considering that is what is seed wants its hard to get into that guys head since he not just wears his mask even in prison but also never utters a word  the movie has barely any dialog anyway so do not mindnine boll goes for a nihilistic shocker end where seed locks the daughter in with her dead dad to rot like the persons we saw on video on sequence threethis is it no message no plot no reason no face behind the mask no background except a stupid story that seed was burnt as a childthis movie relies purely on few key scenes and their shock value i hardly remember a movie this empty of any emotion or message or entertainment its like watching august underground  that is fine with me some people will enjoy this brainless snuff but what is really hard to stand about it is the pseudomessage in the beginning and the fact that the movie is well made considering camerawork effects and even the acting is too good for this waste of celluloid so how does boll get money to make such movies when thousands of talented directors work on shoestring budgets seed is not just the essence of ridiculous its living proof that the free market is flawed  lucky uwe that the german taxpayer is paying for a lot of this waste to get deductments,0
john carpenters halloween is quite frankly a horror masterpiece it tells the immortal story of escaped mental patient michael myers who returns to his hometown on halloween night to stalk and kill a group of babysittersthis was the first and without doubt the best in the halloween franchise carpenter shows great restraint in pacing the story very slowly and building likable characters unusual for a horror pictureeven more unusual is the nonexistence of blood and gore and yet it remains the scariest halloween to date get that halloween marked the film debut of jamie lee curtis and a defining point in the late great donald pleasances career a true classic,1
as i was watching this film on video last night i kept getting these tingles that told me this one will endure i have a feeling i will be watching this again and again for years to comeit is got all the timeless qualities you could ask for in a storyfilm and even though some cultural references are obscure for me a western viewer at the core this is a universal tale,1
disowned by richard c sarafian this disaster stunk up japanese theaters before coming to the states and going immediately to video where it was not seen again until the turner networks needed something other than infomercials to fill their threeamsixam time slots and found this tape at the bottom of their bin the smithee name is supposed to be used when the studio hacks the movie so badly that the director no longer wants his name attached to it but i am afraid that sarafian can not blame the studio entirely on this one the actors mostly recent graduates of overacting one hundred and one deliver one cornball line after another the plot is convoluted the special effects are unimpressive the parts that are not laughable are just plain boring the script or the book must have been good  why else would palance matheson boyle or heston agree to appear in this dud but something went horribly wrong from the page to the screen summary avoid not even bad enough to be sobadit isgood,0
in the classic sense of the four humors which are not specific to the concept of funny or even entertainment altmans health treats all of the humors and actually in very funny entertaining ways there is the phlegm as personified by lauren bacalls very slow guarded and protective character esther brill who is mission in life appears to be all about appearance protecting the secrets of her age and beauty more than her wellbeing there is paul dooleys choleric dr gil gainey who like a fish out of water perhaps more like a seal flops around frenetically barking and exhorting the crowds to subscribe to his aquatic madness the melancholy of glenda jacksons isabella garnell smacks of shakespeares troubled and selfrighteous hamlet  even proffering a soliloquy or two and let us not forget henry gibsons bile character bobby hammer the breast that feeds the baby rules the world then there is the characters harry wolff and gloria burbank james garner and carol burnett respectively relatively sane characters striving to find some kind of balance amongst all the companion and extreme humors who have convened for health  a kind of world trade organization specializing in health which is to say anything but health this is altman at his classic best,1
i was on france around march five and i love to go to this film festivals i knew about this cinémas damérique latine de toulouse but i have never went to it i decided to go and then i caught cero y van four the film is stunning it does not caused the impact on me like with the mexican users because it was frenchsubtitled but it is still shockingthis film is a satire about urban violence about kidnapping and crime on the streets in mexico it is a crude portrait of the city of a metropolis secuestro express with a stunning mia maestro which was also a satire of kidnapping almost but with a more serious tone has and i think so some kind of connection with cero y van four a sort of redemption story and that how much is too much man on fire that was stunningly strong was also not a satire but a crude portrait into the streets of mexico or it is like the brave one a film that shocks and hits you in the guts very hard this is like the usual suspects it has some plot twists and turns but that makes it even more believable verdict a film that shocks and makes you believe that there is no security on the streets anymore stunning dialogue impressive direction and astonishing performances cero y van four is a film that you will not forget soon leaves you shaking and stunned,1
the most misogynistic movie of all time not to mention by sixtyeight should not they have moved beyond white people in brown face playing the indians my favorite parts though have to be when the girls giggle and blush as the bikers drag them off to gang rape them rape is fun who knew let us see then there is the blatant ripoffs of the hustler fat boss character actually plays pool while scheming to destroy the indians with the lead rebel dude the horrific acting the soonthenosetheymightaswellhavejusttoldyouwhattothink music cues the lack of anyone who is actually indian in this movie and who are we supposed to be rooting for i have to say it figures that quentin tarantino loves this movie even though his movies tend to champion strong women i have heard from at least one source that in real life he is a misogynistic idiot why did i watch it you ask do not ask,0
spoilersin the words of jeanpaul sartre hell is other people in the odd couple jack lemmon and walter matthau demonstrate just how accurate this can be as felix ungar and oscar madison lemmon and matthau respectively create two good friends who decide to live together as the two begin to slowly grow more and more frustrated with each other the laughs come thick and fast before felix departs leaving oscar a changed and more cleanly individualjack lemmon as ungar is absolutely superb as the neurotic cleaning obsessed divorcee coping with life as a single man walter matthau in contrast to lemmons character is equally as good as the slobbish sports writer who simply wants to play poker to earn money for his child benefitslemmon and matthau are magnificant in their selected parts to some degree dependent upon the beautiful script by neil simon and simultaneously because they work well as a team as two friends who are inherently different in lifestyles although similar in relationships with exwives and children these two late great actors create a partnership which is practically impossible to recreate so great in fact that the world screamed out so much for something similar that two years before matthaus death and three before lemmons the characters were reunited in an inferior sequel this idea whilst following hollywoods irritating obsession with sequels might have worked to a certain degree but at the same time it could never come close to replicating the genius of this original filmultimately it is not really possible to say anything else with simons amazing script filled with humour and laughter the creators of this film were already onto a hit the casting of jack lemmon and walter matthau as felix ungar and oscar madison though is the most important part of this film the odd couple with it is traditional soundtrack which even gained a tribute in the simpsons it is excellent script and it is genius leading men is a tribute to cinema and a feature for history to remember,1
first off  there is absolutely no flirting going on in this film  with anthony or anyone else these people do not flirt  they just do it your first test of endurance is to wade through more than fifteen minutes of intense violence and sexual perversion this would not be so bad  hell i like violence and perversion as much as the next reviewer but without a context to put it in it is repellent so you make it through the torture and mayhem then we meet donna and the movie turns into something all together different  not better  just different a road picture without heart there are lame attempts at comedy thanks to cameos  broadly written and broadly played by broads like judy tenuta and mink stole and a few hookers and drag queens too they all deserve better the photography is purposely disorienting so if you get motion sickness or really any kind of sickness  this flick is not for you come to think of it i am not sure just who this flick is for except maybe gay and bisexual sm fans who like poorly scripted poorly shot indy films about themselves,0
what an incredible fall for sean ellisyou gather a bunch of your friends at home all hyped about the follow up work of sean ellis you have an vague idea of the plot no spoilers that could kill the fun very high expectationsit is late at night perfect atmosphere for a movie of this typefifteenminutes passes and you start telling yourself it is bound to pick up at twentyfivemins you start wondering if you should just go to sleep and save this for another time when you can fully appreciate the expected not existent subtle touches over the half hour mark you realize half of your your hyped up audience is already asleep and call it a daya few days later when you exhaust all other material to watch you go back to this in the middle of the day this time hoping your mood will keep you awake this time ten minutes later you find yourself fastforwarding the unbelievably and needlessly long intermediate transitions and images any other stuff i would have given up already but there is cashback and its legacy but that legacy can only carry you so long this is a new level of boring moviemaking imagine a short story extended to a novel with just descriptions this is what it isdecent cast is wasted there is no cinematography that leaves you in awe like cashback either there are films that annoy you there are films that lack certain aspects or just cheesy unfortunately this is just a waste of timefinal words stay away,0
this is possibly one of the worst movies i have ever seen i do not care what the critics say it is bad i think the problem is with kunderas novel it is not that it is unfilmable it is just that like ninetynine of his work it is pretentious and overdrawn he seems to be enamored with himselfhis characters come off as navelgazing and his novels as a whole are misogynistic i have read many of his works even his socialist realist poetry that was truly awful  i just do not understand what the fuss is about characteristics like the selfabsorption in his novels make for infuriating reading in a movie all the things that i dislike about kundera were magnified maybe i just missed something but i do not think so on a side note i cannot believe that this is a criterion collection dvd no way is this movie that essential,0
there are many kinds of reunion shows one kind is where old actors are taken out of mothballs and set to recreate characters they have not played for twenty or thirty years these have mixed results return to mayberry despite some silliness was okay return to green acres as execrable eddie albert used a word for the script i will not repeat here but both it and the movie stink rescue from gilligans island filled in a necessary gap in the story of the castaways though the show itself was silly even from a gilligans island viewpoint in most cases the scripts are weak sometimes a silliness appears in the scripts that is too knowing  and in comedy it is nearly always fatal for the characters to know they are being funny new characters are introduced who do not fit the mix in the main these reunion shows are pretty weak a second sort of reunion show is the kind where the cast lays its past aside but sits around telling stories reminiscing interspersed with flashbacks from the shows then there are movies based on the shows which are rarely good and movies based on the history of the show the brady bunch has had both of these happen to it with various resultsreturn to the batcave uses nearly all the above with a wonderfully twisted viewpoint which makes it the best of the reunion shows and has raised the bar for the othersadam west and burt ward and summoned to a showing of the original batmobile while they are there the car is stolen the adam west of the movie is a man demented he called jerry his butler alfred he opens a bust of shakespeare in his apartment and reveals a hidden pole to slide down to the parking garage he is obsessed with being a crime fighter when in fact he is merely a washed up actor when the batmobile is stolen he not only believes it is his duty as a crime fighter to recover it he drags and unwilling burt ward in as his assistantthe pursuit is largely loquacious with west and ward reminiscing about the old days it is broken by flashbacks with actors playing west and ward in the old days the modern scenes and the flashbacks both have the wacky lack of reality the show maintained there are also running gags that show west is able to make fun of himself in wards book about his time on the show he spoke frankly about wests libido and also his being a skinflint west makes ward pay for everything in their pursuit down to tips and bus fare the clues they follow the characters they meet even in flashback all fit the mentality of the old series and there are several homages including a fist fight with written sound effectsthe whole thing is extremely funny and done with great panache there are also cameos by julie newmar looking like she is had one facelift too many and frank gorshin reminding us why he has such a cult following gorshin will be the riddler when jim carey his obvious successor is long forgotten the movie builds to a fairly obvious but funny climaxthis show is a model for reunion shows  unfortunately there are few that can fit the pattern this show had actors replaying their old characters young actors playing a movie about the making of the show the actors west and ward reminiscing and a modernday movie with the real adam west playing the demented adam west it has everything if you loved the old show this is the stopper on the bottle,1
i gave timecop a perfect ten i gave this oneits story is very boring and it has only little to do with the original timecop lots of things from timecop was scrapped and they put in new stupid stuff instead this story is taking place in two thousand and sixty if i remember correctly but for some reason the timetraveling is now more dangerous confusedand the action scenes are nothing to be happy about well most of them are not only the first one is great and there are not many action scenes at all and they are all pretty shortat one point in the story the main character travels through time about five times within a few minutes no wait make that two timesin short do not waste time watching this movie it is not worth it,0
this seems like one of those movies that we think we should like but i did not it seemed to be trying way too hard to be artsy all flash with no content it has some beautiful scenes and any one of them are nice to watch but tack them all together and it becomes an arduous task just to sit through it i rented this because of the glowing reviews on the video carton and the fact that i am a big shakespeare fan but i was very disappointed i just found it a bit pretentious and at times boring,0
after harry reems teenage girlfriend is raped by zebbedy colt the nightwalker reems becomes despondent and consoles himself by having sex with some lesbians meanwhile colt who carries a cane and dresses like a magician rapes some more women eventually reems decides to track him down and end his crime spree despite being shot on film and marginally nasty it looks like any other seventys porno and is ineptly executed the rapeabuse scenes are surprisingly restrained and the attempt to cash in on death wish is laughable r bolla cannibal holocaust plays a cop colt who is usually overthetop wigs out in a couple of scenes but he is too well behaved for my money this roughie could have been much rougher,0
dooohhh my bwainn hurrrts well it certainly does after this endurance test of a film how on earth i managed to keep going without hitting the fast forward button lord only knows maybe it is memaybe i do not get the premise of the film or maybe i do not appreciate it is alleged mystical atmosphere in my humble opinion though the film has about as much mystical atmosphere as a trip to mcdonaldsin addition the characters were all dreadful and there is more character development in a tom  jerry cartoon yaarrrghhh why do i do it why do i watch such tripe it is enough to make one run away and join a monastery or the foreign legion yaargh an absolutley dreadful film in just about every respect apart from that it is not to bad,0
this is a really good film and one that i have enjoyed watching several times michael caines awesome as always michael caine has received kind of a reputation for taking any role in any movie no matter what the quality or lack of same but he does a good turn in playing sidney from the start it is so well written who would have thought that ira levin who wrote such creepy stuff as the boys from brazil and rosemarys baby could write something this witty let us face it  michael caine chris reeve dyan cannon henry jones how are you going to go wrong with a cast this good directed by sidney lumeti am really reticent to go on because if anyone were to give away anything about this film it would be a crime just watch it and adore it,1
oh dear me rarely has a horror film bored me or made me laugh as much as this one after a spirited start with an intriguing premise it descends into not much more than a slasher flick with some supernatural and sexual asides the usually excellent alice krige is wasted in this one and the plot twists are ludicrous do not bother unless you are really desperate rating threeten,0
i watched this movie when joe bob briggs hosted monstervision on tnt even he could not make this movie enjoyable the only reason i watched it until the end is because i teach video production and i wanted to make sure my students never made anything this bad  but it took all my intestinal fortitude to sit through it though it is like watching your great grandmother flirting with a fifteen year old boy  excruciatingly painfulif you took the actual film dipped it in paint thinner then watched it it would be more entertaining seriouslyif you see this movie in the bargin bin at smart back away from it as if it were a rattlesnake,0
ok i would not normally watch a farrelly brothers movie i cannot recall ever watching one i also do not recall watching a jimmy fallon movie alright i did watch taxi but i said penance and was forgiven for that mistake but this movie had drew barrymore and i just think she is the cutest thing i do not know what it is about her but i just smile the whole time i am watch her she just captivates me that way i mean i even watched adam sandler just to see her in fifty first dates how sad is that this was not the greatest baseball movie  it was not supposed to be it was a love story about a sad puppy that hung on to the only thing that never let him down until he found something worth giving that up for it had a predictable ending but there was so much on the way there that made it worthwhile,1
embarrassingly i just watched this movie for the first time thirteen years after its release it is a story that any father or brother can relate to one brother is a bit wild the other brother is the typical older child craig sheffer is a little too unemotional as the oldest brother but pitt is amazing and skerritt is perfectly cast as the father the fishing scenes that were filmed in montana are absolutely breathtaking i had no idea that fly fishing could be so attractive the movie closely follows the book with only a few modifications to make it more appropriate for a movie format unlike most book to movie stories this one measures up it is a perfect movie for anyone who wants a quiet night with a powerful and somewhat emotional movie,1
this has the funnist jokes out of all the cheech  chong flicks it is the first one i saw with these guys i found it to be really good my dad actually recommended me to get it what a great role model and my grandma actually bought it for me knowing what it was like what a family i have well this movie is pretty good and great to rent when you want to see a good classic i must warn you though this is not gutbusting funny it has its moments but not as funny as there is something about mary check it out anyway i am sure you will laugh unless your an antidrug activist or something,1
waste of my life  the director should be embarrassed why people feel they need to make worthless movies will never make sense to me when she died at the end it made me laugh i had to change the channel many times throughout the film because i was getting embarrassed watching such poor acting hopefully the guy who played heath never gets work again on top of that i hope the director never gets to make another film and has his paycheck taken back for this crap  two out of ten ,0
this film is quite boring there are snippets of naked flesh tossed around in a lame attempt to keep the viewer awake but they do not succeedthe best thing about the movie is lena olinshe does a masterful job handling her character but daylewis garbles most of his lineskaufman clearly had no idea how to film this the incongruities in bouncing between domestic householdmarriage issues and political crises are badly matched character attitudes change without explanation throughout badly disjointed,0
i did not approach still crazy with any real anticipation just another rocknroll picture i figured good nostalgia for the baby boomers this film is partially that but so much more brian gibson the director previously helmed a biography of tina turner and is quite successful in his style i suppose it is fitting that this was his last filmthe cast is wellchosen bill nighy is perfect in his role as the bands frontman actorturneddirector bruce robinson appears as the bands washedup guitarist he does a superb job even though he has not appeared on film since the late seventys if you are looking for an touching and funny film with some great songs you have found itsevenfour out of ten,1
i was given the book version of kazaam for my eightth birthday and people always say the book versions are always better than the movie but this time they were wrong at least with the movie it is over soonthe acting in this is terrible which i expected from a film with shaq who plays a magical rapping genie that comes out of an old ghetto blaster which there was probably a good reason he was trapped in there the kid in the film that plays max is whiny and a terrible actor he is bullied by neighborhood kids which i do not blame them because he is a little douche bagthe story is just plain stupid and extremely cliché about a boy who is father is always working and never around who finds a new friend who makes his life better and eventually helps him reconnect with his fathereven at eight years old i thought this was a stupid idea it is a surprise any of the people whom worked on this film had careers after wards because it is an embarrassment and should have never been made i could ramble on even more about how this movie sucks but you should already know just by reading the plot,0
an awful film it must have been up against some real stinkers to be nominated for the golden globe they have taken the story of the first famous female renaissance painter and mangled it beyond recognition my complaint is not that they have taken liberties with the facts if the story were good that would perfectly fine but it is simply bizarre  by all accounts the true story of this artist would have made for a far better film so why did they come up with this dishwaterdull script i suppose there were not enough naked people in the factual version it is hurriedly capped off in the end with a summary of the artists life  we could have saved ourselves a couple of hours if they would favored the rest of the film with same brevity,0
in factit is basically the same movieand they could not even get the time line of events correctmaybe that was intentional due to laziness or not caringeither waythis thing is a real wooferit does not even deserved to be called a moviei viewed this as a so called second feature on the disc containing the original the boogeymani thought my head would explodeand i urge you to run as far in the opposite direction of this thingif you should be cursed with the misfortune of combing across it is pathit should come with a warning label likewarningmay cause your iq to drop several points if you are within it is vicinityfor methere is no doubt this thing is a zeroten,0
this is according to me a quite bizarre movie with a lot of humor in it i would not say that it is very scary but more fun i guess that is if you like horror movies scarecrow kind of remembered me of children of the corn but still not if you compare these two movies this is much more fun to watch ,1
ok ok do not get bent out of round i was kiddingbustin out is actually a better and truer title anyhooracism and crime dramas get the satiric treat meant from our xrated animator friend ralphie boy and he does one of his better jobs hereon the crime front it shows the truth they build it defend it then boredom and stronger rivals because them to maybe lose it see for yourself to see what goes downracist i do not know with scatman rip and the love walrus also rip being black and the main point of view i saw it as an attack on racism mostly the fact that richard pryor liked it says as much as well and the younger pre miami vice phil mike thomas in there was a nice surpriseit is an animated blacksploitation film that is a good thing done well and well done it will make some squirm like the lynching scene but unfortunately that is based on factbut ralphie really should have rethought that title,1
i finally caught up to starlight last night on television and all i can say is   wow it is hard to know where to begin  the incredibly hokey special effects check out the laser beams shooting out of willies eyes the atrocious acting the ponderous dialogue the mismatched use of stock footage or the air of earnest pretentiousness that infuses the entire production this truly is a oneofakind experience and we should all be thankful for that i nominate jonathon kay as the true heir to ed wood,0
what can i say i ignored the reviews and went to see it myself damn the reviews were so right what a waste of money considering it is budgetgood thing i went to see kill bill after this oneto see a really scary movie would be crossroadsbottom line i like girl in gold boots better than this crap,0
i completely agree with jamromfour this was the single most horrible movie i have ever seen holy crap it was terrible i was warned not to see itand foolishly i watched it anyway about ten minutes into the painful experience i completely gave up on watching the atrocitybut sat through until the endjust to see if i could well i did and now i wish i had notit was disgustingnothing happened and the ending was all preachyno movie that bad has the right to survivei implore all of you to spare yourself the terror of fatty drives the busif only i had heeded the same warningplease save yourself from this moviei have a feeling those who rated it highly were involved in the making of the movieand should all be wiped off the face of the planet,0
this is my favorite movie ever i have watched it at least ten times and i cry every time my family begs me not to watch it so i will not have a crying fit i think i love that it is a true story written by antwone himself just as much as i love the movie the acting is top notch and the actors were perfect for their role denzel washington is one of my favorite actors but this is my favorite movie he has done so far i took care of a little boy who was also born in jail he was the most precious little boy i had ever met he has now been adopted by a wonderful family who fought for him for almost two years i saw this movie while the fight was still going on and his future was unsure and i am so happy he is safe and loved and i am so happy antwones happy and found his familyi would love to know more about him and how it has been since meeting his family i just cannot say enough good things about it,1
i have never been a fan of farrah fawcettuntil now she was truly amazing in this movie the emotion she must have gone through shooting retake after retake does not bare thinking about this was a very hard movie to watch the subject matter is decidedly unpleasant and you feel so helpless just sitting and watching a woman being abused for what seems like an eternity i actually felt that the whole thing deflated somewhat when her friends returned to the house and i did not find the conclusion at all plausible the director seemed very keen in using height in his shots and loved using mirror reflections i believe he should have paid more attention to the pace in the second half of this piece i am sure this makes a heck of a powerful piece of theatre this movie for me although it had merit just fell short,1
do not even waste your time let alone pay rental for this piece of dreck how it got made is beyond me i do not know why there is a minimum of ten lines i have already summarized this trashy movie but oh well the acting was awful like they all needed lessons the plot was weak the ending feh i think the cinematography was the only thing that did not totally suck well maybe the sound was minimalistically ok the one good thing is if they could make this movie even make some money with it there may be hope for any screenwriter with a real idea so youall take heart i guess the same holds true of actors if these people actually got paid then you can too,0
potential spoilersman this movie was awful a catholicsuperstitioussuspense thriller it goes over already well tread ground from previous moviesthe doubting priest sex and the priesthood politics and religion church hypocrisy conspiracy involving the church the dawn of a new evil age all kinds of dark magic voodoo battles between good and evilpretty stupid and lame with a weak storyline to suffice the story revolves around two concepts absolution better known as the sacrament of anointing the sick  the last rights a person can ask for to cleanse ones sins while on the brink of death and excommunication the act of cutting a person off from the church basically an excommunicated person cannot receive absolution thus comes in the sin eater and i will leave it at that throw in all the dopy things i already listed and you have the orderi found the sex scene with the priest interlaced with shots of a picture of the virgin mary rather insulting to catholics it also ends with heath ledger saying i paraphrase i am the redeemer and damner of sins i live on without love blah blah blah cue him walking in dark alley with long trench coat alla the matrixi gave this movie a one for not only being crappy and unoriginal but also because it managed to insult an entire faith in the process if you want to see something better i suggest the prophecy with christopher walken,0
hah so this is the movie that the next action stars were getting into well i am glad that i did not participate and did not winis not it funny how one can just look at the first ten seconds and make up ones mind about a movie i mean come on just look at those titles i watched this movieor part of this teleplay since it was produced for tv and we could not bear to watch the whole thing one evening while doing my military service and the audience with me was the typical hodgepodge of average guys that once in a while watch series like las vegas just for the girls in the show so the bar was not really high the most watched movie in my group was girl next door and it was not because of the great script d  but this movies total lack of originality acting scripting and just about everything else that makes a movie good made it pretty easy to switch channel to las vegas or was it csi do not remember without any complaints by the rest of the group and that is rare for heavens sake do not by this movie if it is on tv then yes watch it and contemplate on it my conclusion well since joel silver has indeed produced some of the best actionfilms out there die hard matrix one to name some i can only say that producers do not give the film it is quality they provide money for the directors and to sell this movie just because it is a joel silver movie is just a desperate attempt to conceal the obvious flaws of the crew who really made it,0
i am afraid that you will find that the huge majority of people who rate this movie as a ten are highly christian i am not if you are looking for a christian movie i recommend this film if you are looking for a good general movie i am afraid you will need to go elsewherei was annoyed by the characters and their illogical behaviour the premise of the movie is that the teaching of morality without teaching that it was jesus who is the basis of morality is itself wrong one scene shows the main character telling a boy that it is wrong to steal and then the character goes on to say that it was jesus who taught us this i find that offensive are we to believe that thou shalt not steal came from jesus i suppose he wrote the ten commandments and stealing was acceptable before that i rented the movie from netflix i should have realized the nature of the movie from the comments oh well,0
not only is this film entertaining with excellent comedic acting but also interesting politically it was made at the end of the soviet union but makes fun of the soviet mentality through and through the story is set during the early days of the soviet union and it questions the rationale behind the revolution both in cultural and practical terms of course by the late eightys and early ninetys the bizarre strictures of soviet society are already relaxed but the ideology and mentality is still alive and well and ready for some welldeserved deconstruction happily all this deep philosophical commentary is wrapped in a funny and entertaining packagejur,1
i loved this film i am a true tom hanks fan and i have always been impressed with all of his work from his most dramatic roles like cast away the green mile saving private ryan forrest gump apollo thirteen  philadelphia to his hilarious roles like a league of their own turner and hooch catch me if you can the lady killers big  of course toy story but in this film hanks is not the only great actor who lights up the screen tyler hoechlin an up and coming star who shows great promise in hollywood co stars as hanks son and delivers nothing short of a great performance he is certainly someone to watch out for over his career i believe he will do great things paul newman as always delivers a brilliant performance on screen he is truly a legend we cannot forget the people who did not have such big roles in the film but still helped make it great the beautiful  very talented jennifer jason leigh who is performance in bastard out of carolina  single white female i will never forget brings her grace to the screen as hanks wife in the film and does a superb job liam aiken is another found treasure in film he does such a great job with such a small role and like his roles in lemony snickets and sweet november and i dreamed of africa he gives a great performance,1
the movie is just plain funmaybe more fun for those of us who were young and fans of the ramones around the time the film was made i have watched the film over and over by myself and with friends and it is still fresh and funny at the risk of being too serious the concept of being a big fan of a certain band is timeless and high school students boredom with drudgery of some classes is just as timelessand the film has some gem linesscenesreferences to how our permanent record in high school will follow us through life let me assure you i have been out of high school for uhhh some years and it is not following methe famous static line i am getting some staticnot as much as you are going to get as principal togar approachesthe school board member who is so decrepit he is attended by nursesthe nazi hall monitors love for a body search principal togar announcing i give you the final solution and burning the ramones records note records were what came before cds and of course joey ramone noting things sure have changed since we got kicked out of high school followed by togar asking do your parents know you are ramonesjust one piece of advicedo not look up where the stars are nowjoey ramone sadly died young dey young who was a major hottie in the film today reminds us we all agepj soles career never advanced as we might have expected marla rosenfield as one the other students apparently appeared only in this film one of my male friends dies over her every time we watch the film though i submit her performance was more than adequate and should have brought her more teen film roles and does anyone know what happened to dj don steele so watch and enjoydo not thinkjust have fun,1
i liked this show a lot  we got the first and only it would appear series in the uk on channel four the characterisation was right on the money  a bit like the simpsons in that all the different facets of small town populace were representedthere was no laughter track  i had not seen this on an american tv comedy at the time except for on larry sanders and it really worked well here heightening the suggestion that these wacky cops were really like that and not just hamming it up for the camerasall in all a quirky little number that tickled me just right i cannot help but think that maybe it missed it is mark with certain audiences i think it would have been a cult hit in the uk had it been shown at an acceptable houri will round this off with my standard comment where the hell can i get hold of this to watch it again any ideas,1
hard to believe perhaps but this film was denounced as immoral from more pulpits than any other film produced prior to the imposition of the bluenose hayes code yes indeed priests actually told their flocks that anyone who went to see this film was thereby committing a mortal sini am not making this up they had several reasons as followsitem jane likes sex she and tarzan are shown waking up one morning in their treetop shelter she stretches sensuously and with a coquettish look she says tarzan you have been a bad boy so they have not only been having sex they have been having kinky sex a few years later under the hays code people especially women were not supposed to be depicted as enjoying sexitem jane prefers a guileless if wise and resourceful savage tarzan to a civilized respectable ninetofive man holt when holt at first wows her with a pretty dress from london she wavers a bit when holt tries to kill tarzan and holt and jane both believe he is dead she wavers a lot but when she realizes her man is very much alive the attractions of civilization vanish for her and why not tarzans and janes relationship is egalitarian he lacks the civilized insecurity that would compel him to assert himself as the head of his wife to boot he lacks many more civilized hangups for example jealousy when holt and his buddy arrive tarzan greets them both cordially knowing perfectly well that holt is janes old flame when holt gets her dolled up in a london dress and is slowdancing with her to a portable phonograph tarzan drops out of a tree and draws his knife jealous nope he is merely cautious toward the weird music machine since he is never seen one before once it is explained he is coolitem civilized holt is dirty minded savage tarzan is innocently sexy as jane slips into holts lamplit tent holt gets off on watching her silhouette as she changes into the fancy dress by contrast after tarzan playfully pulls the dress off kicks her into the swimming hole and dives in after her there follows the most tastefully erotic nude scene in all cinema the pair spends five minutes in a lovely water balletthe scene was filmed in three versionsclothed topless and nudethe scene was cut prior to the films release but the nude version is restored in the video now available and when jane emerges and cheetah the chimp steals her dress just for a tease jane makes it clear that her irritation is only because of the proximity of civilized men and their hangups where is the universal prurience so dear to the hearts of seminarians nowhere that is where another reason why the hung up regarded this film as sinful item the notion that man is the crown of creation and animals are here only for mans use and comfort takes a severe beating holt and his buddy want to be guided to the elephant graveyard so they can scoop up the ivory and take it home they want tarzan to guide them to said graveyard you reader are thinking fat chance and you are right he is shocked he exclaims elephants sleep which to him explains everything jane explains tarzans feelings which the two gentlemen find ridiculous item jane the excivilized woman is far more resourceful than the two civilized men she accompanies holt and buddy blow it and find themselves besieged by hostile tribes and wild animals it is jane who maintains her cool while the boys panic she takes charge barks orders at them and passes out the riflesitem janes costume is a sort of poncho with nothing underneath the original idea was for her to be topless with foliage artistically blocking off her nipples which indeed is the case in one brief scenelastly several men of the cloth complained because the film was called tarzan and his mate rather than tarzan and his wife no commentof course tarzan who has been nursed back to health by his ape friends comes to the rescue routs the white hunters and induces the pack elephants and african bearers to return the ivory they stole to the sacred place whence it came the endso there you have it an utterly subversive film like all the other films about complex and interesting women see eg possessed with rita hayworth and raymond massey which constituted such a flowing genre in the early thirtys and which were brought to such an abrupt end by the adoption of the hays code the joie de vivre of this film is best expressed by janes soprano version of the famous tarzan yell a nice touch which was unfortunately abandoned in future productionslet us hear it for artistic freedom feminist jane and sex,1
the brain that would not die was considered so distasteful in one thousand nine hundred and fiftynine that several cuts and the passage of three years was required before it was released in one thousand nine hundred and sixtytwo today it is difficult to imagine how anyone could have taken the thing seriously even in one thousand nine hundred and fiftynine the thing is both lurid and lewd but it is also incredibly ludicrous in a profoundly bumptious sort of waythe story of course concerns a doctor who is an eager experimenter in transplanting limbsand when his girl friend is killed in a car crash he rushes her head to his secret lab with the aid of a few telephone cords a couple of clamps and what looks very like a shallow baking pan he brings her head back to life but is she grateful not hardly in fact she seems mightily ticked off about the whole thing particularly when it transpires that the doctor plans to attach her head to another bodyas it happens the doctor is picky about this new body he wants one built for speed and he takes to cruising disconcerted women on city sidewalks haunting strip joints visiting body beautiful contests and hunting down cheesecake models in search of endowments that will raise his eyebrow but back at the lab the head has developed a chemicallyinduced psychic link with another one of the doctors experiments this one so hideous that it is kept locked out of sight in a handy laboratory closet can they work together to get rid of the bitter and malicious lab assistance wreck revenge upon the doctor and save the woman whose body he hankers for could be leading man jason evers plays the roguish doctor as if he is been given a massive dose of spanish fly virginia leith the unhappy head screeches and cackles in spite of the fact that she has no lungs and maybe not even any vocal chords busty babes gyrate to incredibly tawdry music actors make irrational character changes from line to line the dialogue is even more nonsensical than the plot and you will need a calculator to add up the continuity goofs on the whole the brain that would not die comes off as even more unintentionally funny than an ed wood moviedirector joseph green actually manages to keep the whole thing moving at pretty good clip and looking at the film today it is easy to pick out scenes that influenced later directors who no doubt saw the thing when they were young and impressionable and never quite got over it the cuts made before the film went into release are forever lost but the cuts made for television have been restored in the alpha release and while the film and sound quality are not particularly great it is just as well to recall that they probably were not all that good to begin withnow this is one of those movies that you will either find incredibly dull or wildly hilarious depending on your point of view so it is very hard to give a recommendation but i will say this if your tastes run to the likes of ed wood or russ meyers you need to snap this one up and now four stars for its cheesybizarreness alone gft amazon reviewer,1
that magical moment in life that point between the beautiful innocence of childhood and the confusing whirlwind that marks adulthood    this is what this movie is all about danni wonderfully played by reese witherspoon is right at that moment in life when the movie starts she swoons over elvis playing his records and wishfully thinking about love maureen her sister will soon be off to college has no trouble with attracting boys is beautiful and seems to have it all figured out although she does not she dates a local loser who is father is also after her and just wishes she could find a decent boy and be swept off her feet danni like most young teenagers wishes she could be anyone else but herself because most teenagers think that who they are just is not good enough she wants to be maureen but does not see that she is beautiful herselfthe moment adulthood begins to intrude itself upon her life is when she meets court foster for the first time court who is father has recently died has moved to their old farm to work it with his mother and two younger brothers he has been thrust responsibility when he should be having fun on one particular hot day he goes to the pond and jumps in only to find danni skinny dipping they yell and argue and danni leaves but they see each other a day later when courts mother is invited to dannis to visit old friendsdannis parents danni becomes attracted to court and court to danni she is a tomboy and is spunky has attitude and says what is on her mind court is seventeen and danni fourteen and he knows it but they continue to grow closer with their days at the pond between court working the farm by the time court kisses her one day danni is smitten dannis father tells her to invite court to the house and he does but things are uncomfortable for court on his sort of date the silence though is broken by his meeting with maureen who has yet to see court one look between the two and its all over the looks of pain and defeat on dannis face are both beautiful in their trueness to life and painful at the same time the rest of the movie i will not tell but the movie has more to it than a relationship between a boy and two sistersthe greatness of the movie is in its depiction of lifes moments both beautiful and painful and the relationship between two sisters whose love is tested by both a boy that they love and the pain they must endure both together and individually danni eventually marks her entrance into the world when she sees that the world is unfair painful and maybe even a little less hopeful than when the movie started few movies can truly capture the wonder of childhood and the pain of adulthood so perfectly this movie has since the first time i watched it stuck in my mind its in the my top one hundred movie list and deservedly so i only wish more movies like this were made because if so    my faith in hollywood would be a lot better,1
emma is my favourite jane austen novel  emma is wellmeaning despite her flaws so readers can forgive and love her and the relationship she has with mr knightley which is warm familiar respectful but playful generating that warm fuzzy romantic excitement mr knightley is the perfect man and emma is as close as you could get in those times to an independent clever confident woman  remember she is only twentyone and was sure to have matured and grown out of her flaws who does not want to be emma who does not want to be told off by mr knightley this version of emma gives you no sense of the things that i love about emma i could not even finish watching it i just found it so awful i could not see that warm generous side of emma which drives the reader to love her the patience and warmth she shows to her father the closeness between her and mrs weston which demonstrates her willingness to put her friends happiness above her own as she sacrifices the only equal companion in her household by forwarding miss taylors marriage mr woodhouses character in this adaptation just appears bizarre rather than just quaint elderly and a bit tryingthis adaptation most importantly fails bring to life the relationship between mr knightley and emma their relationship is built on mutual respect and affection mr knightley is indulgent of emmas minor faults trusting that her intelligence and genuine care for others will never allow her to go terribly astray and emma looks up to him though playfully hiding this and continuing to use her own judgement the dressing down he gives her right at the beginning of the show completely overstates the argument between them and ruins all possibility of portraying the nature of their relationship as i have described above mr knightley is also insufficiently attractive to bring to life the sexual tension between the leads or to inspire any admiration from the female viewersreally horrible i cannot understand why anyone who truly like the novel emma could like it unless it miraculously redeems itself after the point i switched it off,0
i tried to like this program i really did i even bought the pilot film first on vhs and later on dvd however i could not get into this story because its two main characters david bruce willis and maddie cybill shepherd just seemed to in love with themselves for one thing i admit was some clever dialog in the shows which was a key part of the success of the tv program and i did appreciate of lot of that dialog basically this was almost like the old screwball comedy movies of the thirtys and fortys with male versus female you get lots of arguing accusations yelling and screaming a lot of people apparently love that sort of bickering but i hate it so i never got on the moonlighting bandwagon only allyce beasley as the hapless aide agnes was entertaining it is too bad she had such little air time shepherd was nice on the eyes and i suppose women would say the same for willis but too much arguing between the two finally turned me off,0
this film has been scaring me since the first day i saw itmy mum had watched it when it was on the telly back in ninetytwo i remember being woken up in the middle of the night by her tearful ramblings as my dad helped her up the stairsshe was saying something like do not let her get me or something like that i asked what had made her so upset and she told me that she would been watching the woman in blackso obviously i had to watch it and even though i was only eleven she let me it scared the s out of me i have been immune to horror films since watching this,1
this is not so much film as big budget childrens television as far as i can tell the villain is a giant swarm of chocolate covered espresso beans this theory seems to be verified by the fact that the subtitles refer to it as insomnia when it is first mentioned that a civilization had been wiped out by insomnia i thought wow a nihilistic martial arts film but no such luck although you have to consider it experimental cinema when the villain is strangled by an old mans long white eyebrows zu warriors makes exactly the same amount of sense whether the subtitles are on or off that is not a good sign i found the special effects to be somewhere between ray harryhausen and xena warrior princess primitive,0
i have always been a great fan of woody allen and always will be for most of what he did in the past but only a blind lover could ignore how dull meaningless pretentious and most of all horrendously acted this movie is a vacuous mental masturbation based on inconsistent grounds and what a disastrous idea to artificially recreate a presumed actor allenclone that is putting into will farrells mouth and gestures what allen would have done in farrells place had he been thirty years younger the outcome was obviously ludicrous and not to speak of the dialogues what was intended to be philosophical reflections turned into an involuntary mockery of intellectual pondering unaware of its comic effect how sad,0
this little seen movie is a languid and laidback giallo it veers away from some of the clichés of the genre and adopts a looser approach it is about a woman searching for her missing lover a psychiatrist who has suddenly vanished for no apparent reason her search leads her to a villa populated by a group of eccentric individuals in true giallo style murder is never far awaythe cast is really rather good we have aldofo celi thunderball alida valli suspiria horst frank cat of nine tails and a very young sybil danning eightys scream queen the lead actress is rosemary dexter and while i am not familiar with her she does a good job in leading the pictureone of the defining features of eye in the labyrinth is its music atypically for a giallo it features a jazzrock fusion soundtrack this score composed by roberto nicolosi is reminiscent of miles davis especially his work on in a silent way it is an excellent soundtrack and really gives this movie a different feel than most gialli the fusion groove accentuates the languid atmosphere and compliments the sunny seafront scenery that the film is mostly made up ofthis is a giallo so we really need to talk about the murder setpieces well this film falls a little short in this regard it is certainly not devoid of them but they are few and far between the opening dreammurder being probably the best on offer as well as a memorable burning car sequence but this really is not a particularly violent film still i do not think it should disappoint too many seasoned fans of the genre the mystery is fairly compelling and it has enough eccentric characters the idiot boy saro and that unsettlingly inappropriate dubbed accent and moments of the bizarre to satisfy while the sleazefactor is upheld with a smattering of nudity throughouteye in the labyrinth plays like a giallo version of an agatha christie mystery as it features a group of unsympathetic characters in a villa all under suspicion of murder we have the obligatory flashbacks detailing their connections with the final hours of the highly unsympathetic murder victim while this is not a gradea example of the genre it is certainly an appealingly different one as it does not borrow too heavily from other films of the subgenre for giallo enthusiasts i give this a thumbs up and hope one day it is given a nice dvd transfer it certainly deserves the treatment,1
an actors first film is usually something one can afford to miss  it is often that first job where the lack of film experience by everyone involved is truly on display and this film is no exceptionbut worse than that even by one thousand nine hundred and eightytwo standards this is so bad it is hysterically funny filmed entirely in the chicago area on an obviously small budget most of the acting by the entire cast is stiff wooden and cartoonish  a cross between a high school play and bad community theater noise from nearby traffic often drowns out the dialog and the dialog is truly bad very declarative in a way that comes off as forced and expedient rather than natural and organic scenes are contrived and choppy and even though the characters go through a span of years neither the children nor the adults age at alli do believe it is possible to make a christian film that is palatable to a large secular audience but too often the creators of such films are so focused on the message or in this case their own autobiographical ties to the project that good film production values are tossed aside i am sure it is no coincidence that the main character has the same name as the producerdirectoreditor  and cast member luckily michael madsen was much more interesting  and believable  to watch in his subsequent films careers like his are certainly not built on films like this one,0
the unborn is a pretty good lowbudget horror movie exploiting the fears associated with pregnancy it is very well acted by the alwaysgood brooke adams and bmovie stalwart james karen although the supporting cast is pretty average for a bgrader the music by gary numan of all people is good too henry dominics script is quite intelligent for this sort of thing although there is a hint of misogyny about it rodman fenders direction is merely adequate and there are some unnecessary cheap scares if you are a fan of adams whose movie career is nowhere near as illustrious as it should be check it out she is great as always,1
the bfg is one of roald dahls most cherished books but in this animated adaptation the magic just is not there this version remains pretty faithful to dahls original story so one cannot lay the blame on john hambleys script if anything the fault lies with the colourless animation the lethargic pace and the generally lacklustre voiceovers one would be right to expect this story to make for a happy vibrant funfilled movie instead the film is a hopelessly dull affair that becomes quite tedious to watch children who are not familiar with the story should definitely read the book first all the film will achieve is to put them off read what is actually a childrens classicyoung orphan sophie voice of amanda root lives in a nonetoofriendly orphanage under the cruel supervision of mrs clonkers one evening she is peering through the window when she spots a massive figure walking stealthily down the village street the figure realises it has been seen so it reaches in through the window and scoops sophie from her bed placing her into its enormous pocket before fleeing into the night sophie soon discovers that she has been kidnapped by a giant from giant country and fears that he will eat her but to her relief he turns out to be a kind and sensitive member of his species who introduces himself as the bfg voice of david jason the bfg refuses to eat people instead restricting himself to foultasting vegetables known as snozzcumbers however giant country is populated by numerous other giants who do feast  every night as it happens  on poor unsuspecting humans sophie and the bfg become great friends and soon they come up with a plan to thwart the other giants together they go to the queen of england voice of angela thorne with their remarkable story and beg her to send the army and the air force to fight the maneating giants the queen agrees and so begins a dangerous operation to capture the bad giants before they can harm anyone elsejason voices the bfg quite well one of the few pluses in the film but his good work is almost ruined by somewhat poor sound quality the rest of the voice work is decidedly uninspired with very little to bring the characters to life similarly the bfg is the only character that is imaginatively animated  sophie lacks appeal and the giants are boringly designed and look almost indistinguishable from each other even the places are uninventive giant country especially comes up short being nothing more than a barren wasteland with occasional rocks and canyons at eightyeight minutes the film is not exactly lengthy yet it drags quite badly in parts due to the soporific handling of several sequences little of dahls mischievous humour is conveyed satisfactorily one chapter in the book deals with the bfgs love of whizzpopping farting and is laughoutloud hilarious in the film the same section is totally killed by unfunny handling i came to the the bfg expecting lots of zest fun and enjoyment but what i got was pretty much the opposite this one is a failed misfire that simply does not match the calibre of the book in any department  unfortunately therefore it must go down as one to skip,0
what a crimeyou forgot to brush your teethlet us make a thirty minute show about it and have a couple of kids make some noise and then have the dad lecture them all because that is what he has to dobut do not forget uncle joey has to make some weird noises and cooky faces then uncle jesse has to show up with his black leather jacket and some jeans and look pretty for a few minutes while everybody discusses how mother would have done things if she were aroundyep full of zany little adventures about a whole bunch of nothing and an entire overlong story to build around itfull house will not only bore you to tears but it will make you age twenty times faster than you normally would,0
this is one a most famous movies of the french sexual empowerment of the seventies starring gerard depardieu and patrick dewaere in extremely sarcastic roles it is also one of the many dark psychological dramas of the seventieseighties such as serie noire buffet froid beau pere all realized by blierhowever i would like to correct the previous comment that was posted on the movie the translated title in english is very far from the french version it is true that both protagonists are going places but the title in french could be literally translated by the waltz dancers which is a metaphor for the movement of the testicles,1
beautiful to watch but what would be the first thing you would do the moment you discovered atlantis explore it here was a golden opportunity to take viewers someplace special instead disney reverted to the same old formula story telling,1
this was the worst movie i have ever seen yet it was also the best movie sci fi original movies are supposed to be bad that is what makes them fun the line i like my dinosaur meat well done is probably the best quote ever also the plot sounds like something out of a pot induced dream i can imagine it now the writers waking up after a long night of getting high and playing dance dance revolution then putting ideas together for this space marines got to alien planet which is infested with dinosaurs and has medieval houses in it to protect a science team studying the planet best idea ever in fact in fits the complete sci fi original movie checklist guns dinosaurs medieval times space travel terrible actingso go watch this movie but do not buy it,1
no likeable characters the lead is a combination of the worst of woody allenpaul provensareiser and the contrived scenes did anyone really think thiat kid on the rollerblades was not going to knock the guy down were just sickeningly bad,0
it was simple and yet so nice i think the whole sense of sex segregation in society which can be bitter was shown very delicately it had a bitter kind of hummer in it the fact that most of the actors were not professionals made the movie more tangible and more realistic there was a documentary side to the movie too the best scenes were those that all the girls banned from watching were listening passionately to the soldier who is supposed to keep an eye on them broadcasting the game if you are an iranian the familiar cheering and dancing in the streets after a game won fills you up with national pride if you are not iranian you will still love it all the same,1
as the celebration of christmas has evolved through the years whether one concentrates on the religious or the secular traditions it is a time when people are supposed to behave a little better to each other that has somehow slipped past one ebenezer scrooge merchant and money lender in nineteenth century londonas his nephew points out to his uncle he does not keep christmas in any way because scrooge feels the whole thing is humbug the humanity in scrooge was driven out long ago he is a hard case a whole lot like his twentyth century counterpart mr potter of bedford falls new yorkbut as charles dickens told this tale redemption is not too late for any of us and a lonely ghost and three spirits visit scrooge and show him howa christmas carol is such a timeless holiday classic that we sometimes forget that it is as much a social commentary of nineteenth century great britain as oliver twist was the characters in this film are middle and lower class the cratchits are a couple of rungs above the street people in oliver twist but they are having to struggle to stay up there still love and happiness radiate their home no thanks to the guy bob cratchit works for like george bailey who did a whole lot of good in his life and just had to be reminded how much ebenezer scrooge needed a wake up call as to the potentiality he still had for doing some good in this old worldpatrick stewart in his live performances and filmed play has pretty much taken over the part of scrooge but george c scott captures the old miser pretty well in this film the meanness of him but with a trace of sadness that makes us root for him to change scott joins a fine tradition of people like reginald owen and alastair sim who have both done great interpretations of scroogeamong the supporting roles i particularly enjoyed david warner as bob cratchit and edward woodward as a hearty and stern spirit of christmas present according to imdb this is one of thirtytwo versions of a christmas carol made that they have archived and it is one of the best,1
this movie is beautifully designed there are no flaws not in the design of the set the lighting the sounds the plot the script is an invitation to a complex game where the participants are on a simple missionpaxton is at his best in this role his mannerisms the infections used in the tones of his voice are without miscue each shot meticulously done surprises turn up one after another when the movie reaches past its first hour this may not be the best picture of the year but it is a gem that has been very well polished it is not for the simple mind,1
my baby sitter was a fan so i saw many of the older episodes while growing up i am not a fan of scooby doo so i am not sure why i left the tv on when this show premiered to my surprise i found it enjoyable to me shaggy and scooby were the only interesting characters dodges tomatoes from fans of the others so i like that they only focus on those two however this may cause fans of the original shows to hate it i like the voice acting especially dr phinius phibes i liked listening to him even before i knew he was jeff bennett and jim meskimen as robi sounds to me like he is really enjoying his job as an actor i also get a kick out of the techies with their slightly autistic personalities and their desires to play dungeons and dragons or act out scenes from star wars not called by those names in the show of course,1
the crush is a pleasant enough fortysomething friends romantic chick flick for the first twothirds or so as it tries to be a brit sex and the city i particularly enjoyed the turnaround of the trophy young hunk whose character is not much fleshed out come to think of it we did not see all that much physical flesh of him either and kenny doughty is worth seeing more of they sure make a lot more deal of young manolder woman than was made of the opposite in either version of sabrina neither movie do i like or for that matter with the douglaszetajones or dionsvengali nuptialssurrounding andie macdowell as an ex pat otherwise are welcome familiars from brit dramas and comedies such as tarttongued anna chancellor the plot twists towards the end feel very deus ex machina but it was not until the credits came up at the end that i realized what might really be wrong just as with sex and the city the writerdirector is male here firsttimer scot john mckay and i think he really wanted to do a script about three gay men probably about them coming out in relation to their lovers and at work the characters are a school principal a cop and a doctor which would have been a better and more interesting movie the working title for the film was the sad fckers club which would have made its parallels with the gay broken hearts club even more obviousoriginally written foursixtwo thousand and two,0
i first saw this movie on mstthreek and although i laughed my posterior off at the jokes i do not particularly think this movie was all that bad sure it was a little hard to understand it is quite obviously low budget but it had a very hitchcocklike plot and i can honestly say that when i viewed the nonmstthreek version i was genuinely entertained this movie is crying out for a hollywood remake,0
redline is a knockoff of fast  furious without any of the redeeming qualities it does not need to have a convoluted plot with multiple twists and surprises but it needs something this is the equivalent of a porn film where the storyline and dialogue consist of sixty seconds at the beginning and the same at the end except that this is worse because you do not get your moneys worth mindnumbingly boring impossible race sequences and a terrible waste of expensive beautiful cars which almost acquire negative points for having appeared in this movie sure she is hot but who is that desperate for an on screen female i feel like the director sat there with a hat full of dialogue and plot snippets and shook an eight ball every time they switched scenes no serious person who races or knows anything about it would watch this movie and enjoy the race scenes,0
kirstie alley looking a bit slimmer but only a bit is in this mess along with a man who is a macguyver lookalike bleached blond hair and all the premise of the movie is about an older woman fifty who cannot get her screenplay produced due to age discrimination so she sends in her younger nephew to pose as the writer not an original idea and not a very good movie with lousy acting inane dialogue and a ridiculous plot there is another plot concerning a writer with a crush or admiration for kirsties character and why this is included is a mystery the actor who portrays kirsties brother is so wooden and miscast it was torture to watch their scenes what is there to say about this film avoid it,0
this is quite possibly the worst movie i have ever seen again i made the mistake of buying the movie because the synapse on the back sounded cool and the front cover looked pretty cool too after buying this and the movie malevolence which i reviewed on here as well i have learned my lesson i love horror movies that take place in the woods or in the desert or on a farm this supposedly takes place in the woods of texas but was probably filmed in the directors backyard the production was probably the worst i ever seen the actors were absolutely the worst the story did not have anything to do with what the back cover said i even tried to sell it to fye and some other mom and pop store that buys used dvds and neither would take it that is how awful this poor miserable excuse for a movie was i have seen some bad movies before troll two for example but this definitely takes the cake i did not think there was a worse movie than troll two boy was i wrong do not buy this movie unless someone hands it to you for free but even than your stuck with it unless you throw it out which is what i am about to do,0
this stylistically sophisticated visual game presents a story within a story the protagonist is scriptwriter bart klever who fights persistently with his new text  which is at the same time the screenplay of the film we are watching in the movie bart plays a scriptwriter writing the script of the film barts struggle with the text becomes a narrative theme as does the environment of the flat where he works and takes care of his little girl the intimate environment offers ample opportunity for games of illusion involving space light colours and a couple of cats the outwardly simple world of the room is further complicated by the unstable dimensions of a text continually influenced by the filmmakers interventions which appears on a computer monitor and serves as a counterpoint to the similarity mutable environment the constantly changing viewing angle complicates answers to questions which arise what is truth and what illusion  which of the observed worlds is primary and superior to the rest can anything serve as a basic orientation point in the narrative space,1
cheaplooking and ugly this film did not even seem to entertain the kids in the audience except for one fairly amusing toilet joke christopher lloyd is way past his prime and actually quite tiresome in this role although the sorry excuse for jokes by the writers do not help   elizabeth hurley is embarrassingly amateurish in a supposedly comic role jeff daniels and darryl hannah avoid humiliation there is really no reason to make this movie especially since it is unavoidable that one will compare it with robin williamss often brilliant improvisations in mork  mindy,0
it was everything this is not it had pace pop and actors who were not afraid to chew the scenery it also had a decent script this one had me scratching my head if farrah is not really serious about a career why does she have a manager and why is he wasting his time if kate and barney are artists why do they sign up for the mother of all jiggle shows like the brady bunch movie where robert reed wants to do shakespeare only to find himself on bb they were not industry names but they were not exactly starving either and while they got the history right the poster was released before farrah got the show silverman rejecting pitches for funniest home videos and american idol and spelling promising his baby girl tori someday he will create a show for her obviously did not happenwhat bothered me was how spellings role is distorted he is shown as the showrunner and creator when he was neither and how he comes up with the idea for ca was is laughablehow were spelling and goldberg allowed to enforce farrahs oral contract when the others were signed and why did not farrah or bernstein tell them she was leaving not because she discovered her inner diva but because majors wanted her to this is why when it tries tries to created conflict and tension by setting farrah up as the bad girl like suzanne somers it fails because the groundwork was never laid  that was where the threes company pic delivered,0
actually this flick made in one thousand nine hundred and ninetynine has pretty good production values the actors are attractive and reasonably talented there are not a bunch of clowns running around blasting away expending hundreds of rounds but never hitting flesh nor are there wild car chasescrashes where thousands of dollars worth of beautiful machines are uselessly trashedthe interiors look respectably modern architecturally and the equipment looks up to snuff well there is that high tech computer room furnished with what look like leftovers from a fiftys electronics lab and the pancake makeup on the corpses cracked me up not pancake makeup in the conventional sense but what looks like dried pancake batter slathered over their exposed skin this is supposed to support the idea that the bodies have calcified  though how the virus would accomplish this transmutation is an exercise left for the student viewerah yes the virus i would like to tell you that this is not the absolute worst premise for a scifi horror flick i know of but i cannot a computer virus that is transmitted via a television or computer monitor screen and becomes a lethal biological pathogen give me a break warp drives a la star trek are one thing but photons becoming viruses this is so silly the desired fright factor just is not realizable the flick could have used one of those awful dream sequences where the dead come alive or have a cat jump out of the closet or something because the viral thingamajig is not doing it one presumes robert wagner has the same excuse for playing in this inanity that lord oliver gave for some of his later trashy venues he needed the money no other comparison between the two should be construedhowever,0
this movie is awesome for three main reasons it is esthetically beautiful i absolutely loved that there is a bold color theme throughout the movie with extraordinary costumes and picturesque sets a photography which looks very costly and probably was not completes the look  i always enjoy those stories about groups of misfitsloners coming together and becoming a family  sometimes they fall into clichés but this one does not this group of actors really portrays well flawed yet extremely likable characters alan larkin is the best between him  the van and the road movie theme i could not help but remember my favorite movie of last year little miss sunshine  i discovered fabrizio bentivoglio  very interesting actor and just got annoyed a tiny little bit by til schweiger performance at times  the opening scene all the scenes where they mess up their tricks are very funny there is a mix of humor and emotion throughout the film i like the end a lot and of course it is all about the magician theme  a good magician is making the audience look where he wants them to to create an illusion which happens to be exactly what a movie director does and that is why they call it movie magic,1
name just says it all i watched this movie with my dad when it came out and having served in korea he had great admiration for the man the disappointing thing about this film is that it only concentrate on a short period of the mans life  interestingly enough the mans entire life would have made such an epic biopic that it is staggering to imagine the cost for productionsome posters elude to the flawed characteristics about the man which are cheap shots the theme of the movie duty honor country are not just mere words blathered from the lips of a highbrassed officer  it is the deep declaration of one mans total devotion to his countryironically peck being the liberal that he was garnered a better understanding of the man he does a great job showing the fearless general tempered with the humane side of the man,1
this is a cleaver film featuring love through the ages the film consists of keaton seeking out a lady love in the stone age in ancient rome and in the present one thousand nine hundred and twentys in all three cases he is the usual wimpy buster and he battles against wallace beery for his lady love of the three time periods i think i liked the roman one best even though i admit it might have also been the cheesiest i actually liked the scenes with the lion that was obviously a guy in a costume as well as the weird chariot race in the snowbut what i really enjoyed the most was seeing all of keatons amazing acrobatics however all three time periods were good old fashioned fun and the film while not his best is still an exceptional and enjoyable film check it out,1
okay when i came on the board for this movie i was really expecting people to be making fun of it i was surprised to see that people over the age of seven liked it i enjoyed the movie but only bc me and my little sister who is in fact only ten made fun of the whole thingi am sorry jordan but that acting was awful you know a movie is headed for the toilet when the lead cannot act and it did not even have a good script or plot to redeem it i also thought that the character of pamela was very very lame borderlining patheticeven with that being said i thought there were a few good actors such as gorgeous spencer hollywood and ronnie still not enough to redeem the movietwo things about this movie that i just cannot get overone that that spencer guy would fall for her okay eww i looked up the dates and while in reality he is only about four years older than her the difference in go figure seemed much larger jordan is a very pretty girl but in gf she seemed like ten or twelve she seemed like a little kid jake abel spencer seemed like a college studenttwo that there is any way that kristi yamaguchi would come just to skate for one girl i mean i know that katelin is good and everything but it still just seemed kind of unlikely that kristi would go to a boarding school that did not even have scholarships for skating or that a school would have employed a skating coach with such connectionsthat all being said it was not the worst movie ever known but it was not very good even by dcom standards which i consider quite low,0
i probably give this more credit than it deserves because it is halloween i was just at knotts scary farm and i was in a mood to watch a really cheesy halloween movieoh and it only cost me one dollarusually i will ffwd through a movie like this to get to the good stuff but i resisted the urge here and i am still not sure why it was obvious from the opening shots this was not a real movie not even a bmovie it is more in the category of the decoteau horror movies like the brotherhood that are shot on filmlook video for about fifty cents in fact i was half afraid any minute one of his beefy college boys would stagger out rubbing himself in his underpants or something there were no cutaway shots too expensive to do multiple camera setups and flat lighting butit is hard to pinpoint there is something refreshing about watching a director with no money pull off a halfdecent movie the fact that he is doing even a halfdecent job is commendable and this movie has it is share of meritsthe acting is not bad the photography is pretty good if too bright to be scary there are some surprises and the whole thing is sort ofdifferent somehowa bunch of college kids are for some unknown reason stuck in the warehouse where they are decorating the annual haunted house a creepy old man gives them a satanic book and they accidentally summon up the powers of hell this results in the costumed people in the haunted house becoming who they are made up to be and causing a lot of mayhem and human suffering along the way we are treated to an oddly complex and thoughtful lesbian relationship subplotit is interesting that this couple seems to be the most wellrounded in the movie yes there is a sex scene but it is not salaciousor at least no more so than you would find in any legit movie about lesbians that shows them having sex it is rather unusual for a horror film to take the time and effort to do this without resorting to cheap exploitation the other thing about this that held my interest was how it was clearly trying to emulate the stupid kids have sex and get killed vibe of the eightys slashers it is hard to take that on because there are so many of those films that already exist the genre has been done to death i am not sure if it is good or bad that these filmmakers simply tried to make another entry in that genre without irony as if it was still a living genre but i appreciated the attemptwhich is why i sat through it sometimes you just want to watch a mindless nobudget aforeffort horror film there really was too much set up not enough gore endless plotholes deadends and clichés and the unfortunate overall feel of a movie that simply did not have enough money behind it to be the film the producers envisionedbut at the very least the haunted house scenes were pretty cool i would pay to go to that haunted house if it existed and did not mind paying a dollar to see it on dvd even if i will never watch this againoh and possible spoiler but there was great brief business with the vampire girl in the coffin i used to be claustrophobic but i have changed ha ha good one,0
sidney franklins the good earth has achieved classic status thanks to a timeless story and superb acting especially from luis ranier who won an oscar for her portrayal of olan rainers performance is so complete she is nearly unrecognizable having very little dialogue throughout the entire film and it is a long one rainer relies instead on facial and body language she looks and acts chinese to the point that anyone unfamiliar with her work could easily mistake her as suchthe film remains relevant today because it explores the rags to riches story and the universal themes that come with it when lung and wife olan finally achieve financial success after years of famine and poverty they find a life full of possessions but lacking in meaning it is only when they return to the earth after fighting off a swarm of locusts the special effects used to create them are still incredible and beautiful to watch that they again find fulfillment a common formula told with the unique perspective of a chinese family especially for one thousand nine hundred and thirtyseven makes the film a classic money is not worth anything without friends and family a point that the film drives home perfectly in it is last ten minutes with an emotionally fulfilling conclusion,1
all this talk about this being a bad movie is nonsense as a matter of fact this is the best movie i have ever seen it is an excellent story and the actors in the movie are some of the best i would not give criticism to any of the actors that movie is the best and it will always stay that way,1
busy phillips put in one hell of a performance both comedic and dramatic erika christensen was good but busy stole the show it was a nice touch after the smokers a movie starring busy which was not all that great if busy does not get a nomination of any kind for this film it would be a disaster forget mona lisa smile see home room,1
well i hate hollywood but love cinema so i have to watch these cruddy movies in theaters and i was hoping vanilla sky would be good i was hoping that they would either keep the original open your eyes exactly the same or they would make it their own well it happened to be a little bit of both and it suckedit started out good i love radiohead i wish there was more of that but by the end we are listening to good vibrations by the beach boys talk about a wide range of suck between they had one or two good songs in the club and maybe a couple others but why oh why did they have to blare gv during the climax it was more annoying than confusing or blatant especially when it has nothing to do with the plot at least put some meaning behind the songs kid a  primary whateverhe also did a bang up job with the club scene that was cool otherwise the movie was one big ball of arrogance as if audiences would get the movie the ones that would get it read subtitles and the rest will not its as simple as that the motivations got all screwed up i did not comprehend the diaz motivations had not they done the chicken soup night before and some of the others and i hate kurt russell stay overboard tom cruise cannot act especially in these types of movie ie eyes wide shut and the elevator i get it anyways they tried improving the original with a crappy american rock soundtrack and crappy angles and good film print and glossy processing and it would have helped if crowe had not screwed it uptwoten major disappointment,0
when the us entered world war i the government forced hollywood to churn out propaganda films the little american is probably the best of the lot because it stars mary pickfordpickford plays a young woman torn between two men jack holt german and raymond hatton french but her decision is delayed because of the war as both men enlistwhen the ship pickford is sailing on is sunk by the germans think lusitania because it is carrying munitions pickford has a great scene as she stands on the lifeboat and yells at the german commander later on of course she runs into both holt and hatton when she is being held as a war prisoner at a châteaudirector cecil b demille provides one truly great scene in this film as pickford and holt are wandering through a bombedout village they pass a destroyed church of which only one wall remains standing against the wall is a very large crucifix as they stand and watch the wall collapses but the jesus figure remains suspended in mid air it is a very surreal moment in a film that is otherwise very straightforward and unartsypickford is as always a pleasure to watch she was always a very natural actress who avoided the armwaving histrionics many other actors of the day used she is also very very pretty holt is very good here in a leadingman role hatton is ok among the list of name actors in extra parts are wallace beery ramon novarro colleen moore ben alexander hobart bosworth norman kerry walter long james neill and edythe chapmannot a great film but interesting to see us propaganda at work,1
i just saw this film on dvd last night and decided to check out the reviews this morning it seems that i robot has polarized the critical viewing community here on imdb and given rise to a lot of insults and namecalling tooi find this somewhat surprising as this film is not great or even good but neither is it terrible or even really bad what this film really is isdepressing depressing that the us filmgoer population is so ready to lap up insipid clichéd reheats and acclaim them as spectacular new works this film as retread written all over it from the plot line an uneasy mix of asimov and modernday uberaction to smiths character a smartmouthed cynic with a backbone of titanium to the special effects that borrowed from matrix and a few othersi robot is sadly quite possibly the perfect action movie for todays audience superficial plot insipidly snappy dialog and lots and lots of adrenaline smith is mediocre but we already knew that he seems to be hollywoods latest unsuccessful attempt to create a black bruce willis the story has lots of holes in it of all sizes but i do not think most people drawn to this film are criticallyminded enough to notice perhaps a blockbuster by todays standards but very bmovie compared to true winners,0

this has to be the worst piece of garbage i have seen in a whileheath ledger is a heartthrob he looked deformed i wish i would known that he and naomi watts are an item in real life because i spent two of the longest hours of my life wondering what she saw in him orlando bloom is a heartthrob with the scraggly beard and deerintheheadlights look about him i cannot say i agreerachel griffiths was her usual fabulous self but geoffrey rush looked as if he could not wait to get off the set i am supposed to feel sorry for bankrobbers and murderers this is a far cry from butch cassidy which actually was an entertaining film this was trite clicheridden and boring we only stayed because we were convinced it would get better it did notthe last tenfifteen minutes or so were unintentionally hilarious heath and his gang are holed up in a frontier hotel and women and children are dying because of their presence that is not funny but it was funny when they walked out of the hotel with the armor on because all we could think of was the black knight from monty python and the holy grail i kept waiting for them to say i will bite yer leg off we were howling with laughter as were several other warped members of the audience when we left pretty much everyone was talking about what a waste of time this film wasi may not have paid cash to see this disaster sneak preview but it certainly was not free it cost me two hours of my life that i will never get back,0
i could not relate to this film it failed to engage me either intellectually emotionally or aesthetically the dialogue was very dense and uninvolving i could not connect with and hence care about any of the characters and i am finding it hard to find much that is positive to say about iti have read that to understand it properly one needs to be familiar with some of the more obscure aspects of catholic theology i will admit that as an atheist i probably am unfamiliar with many of the finer details of catholicism but i have also seen many films dealing with religious issues that have touched me because their themes are still universal to the human condition and do not rely on specialised knowledge or beliefs,0
the bourne ultimatum begins recklessly midchase and in pulsepounding fashion explodes from there as jason bourne matt damon absolutely superb tracks down the masterminds behind the cia blackops that turned him into the perfect killer in a final attempt to learn his true identity a devastatingly icy david strathairn as the man behind the curtain is added to the returning cast of regulars including joan allen excellent and julia stiles nonexistentlike the second entry in the series i wished paul greengrass shaky handheld camera would go static at least for the few minutes of downtime however that being said it is a perfect way to capture the tense claustrophobic feel of the intimate handtohandcombat scenes and works equally well in the chase scenes which are mostly on foot and across rooftops with the occasional big car pileup part of the fun of the bourne series is the constant globehopping and manipulation of technology and communications that seem to defy the laws of physics and current capabilities the bourne films seem to exist in some sort of gritty hyperreality that is full of technologicalbased magic it makes no sense that everyone seems to be just in the right place at the right time but i will be damned if it is not a blast to watch them get therewith the absence of the emotive and involving franka potente the writers attempt to create some emotional connection between damon and stiles but she is so blankfaced an actress it never really leads to anything still this can be forgiven for unlike the identity and the supremacy this ultimatum reveals all and we finally learn the truth about bournes past it is an entertaining and satisfying conclusion to the series and if they have any good sense and damon gets his wish this will be the perfect end to it,1
this cartoon was strange but the story actually had a little more depth and emotion to it than other cartoon movies we have a girl at a camp with low self esteem and hardly any other friends except a brother and sister who are just a miserable as she is she reaches the ultimate low point and when the opportunity arises she literally makes a pact with a devillike demon i found this film to be very true to life and just when things could not be worse the girl sees what she is done she feels remorse and then changes and then she helps this dark mystical creature learn the human quality of love the twins improve too by helping the little bears and then they get a sense of self worth too a very positive message for children though some elements of the film was strange it was and still is a rather enjoyable film the music from stephen bishop tootsie songs made the film even better,1
this is the kind of film you want to see with a glass of wine the fire on and with your feet up it does not require that much brainpower to follow so is very good after a long day i would say it is very unrealistic  if you expecting anything serious then do not bother but it is very funny just the thought that a businessman would go so far as to agree to live in a slum for a while and then actually get to enjoy it i would definitely recommend it,1
there is no denying that ealing comedies are good but for me this film stands out as one of the bestthe basic premise of the film is that a small part of pimlico in london is discovered to be part of burgundy not the uk we then follow the lives of the residents in their battle to keep the treasure found after the bomb explodes and keep out the black market traders who soon realise that being exempt from uk law rationing does not exist when they become prisoners in their own street because the government has decided to close the boarder we see them fight back against the systemthey are forced to ration water and food in their stand for what is right in fact becoming worse off than they were before it all started that is where the moral comes in it is when they loose all the food that they think they are beaten and call for a surrender only to have the whole of london respond to their plight by sending food lots of it thus enabling them to continue their strugglethis film hits the right note throughout the acting is superb with stanley holloway margaret rutherford hermione baddeley and betty warren standing out it is pitched just right not too sentimental and the moral of the story not forced down your throat well worth a viewing,1
i remember when i was five and my parents thought it was a regular cartoon movieexcept when the bras and bullets started flying i have to agree this movie will make anyone and everyone upset because it is set to discriminate everyone and anyonebut the truth is it is funny as hell as it is deep i recommend this to anyone who likes cult classics also try fritz the cat and the nine lives of fritz the cat if i am correct ralph bashki did that movie tooit involves a cat that goes through hard times with family streetsjobs  etc when i was old enough i rented all of these movies out because coonskin was an offensive title during that era it was also labeled as street fighter ralph bashki also made cool world starring a very young brad pitt heavy traffic was another cartoon that dealt with the street life of a young man,1
drones ethnic drumming bad synthesizer piping children singing the most patronizing world music imaginable this is a tourist film and a lousy one what really kills it is the incoherent sequences india egypt south america africa etc etc no transitions no visual explanation of why we are suddenly ten thousand miles away no ideas expressed in images just a bunch of footage of thirdworlders with baskets on their heads as another reviewer said walking along endlessly as if that had some deep meaning if these guys wanted to make a threerd world music video all they had to do was head a few hundred miles south of where the best parts of koya were shot and film in mexico that would have been a much better setting for life in transformationbut no what they decided on was a scrambled tourist itinerary covering half the globe and minddeadeningly overcranked filter shots the only thing to recommend this film is that it does not suck quite as much as naqoyqatsirstj,0
let me start by stating that i usually do like renny harlins directing style for the most part and that the cinematographer should be commended for some the shots unlike harlins elm street four and die hard two which i really liked there is something that is missing from this movie that my friends is a script the dialogue in movies like this is always pretty awful but this one takes the gold medal for stupidity there are so many awful lines in this movie i do not even want to have to remember any of them not just that but the execution of the lines is pathetic and seems more suited toward a bad porn movie than an action adventure it is almost like harlin thought that if they slowed down the words being said they could improve the script wrong againthe sad part is that there is some talented actors thrown into bad roles with worse dialogue stallone has never been a favorite of mine but when he is acting circles around lithgow turner and the worst of the bunch rooker there is something wrong with this picture lithgow played one of the best villains in ricochet yet comes across as someone who cannot act to save his life here how is that possible i have always been a huge fan of his and he gets schooled in acting by stallone who himself still phonedin his performance turners part is so small and pointless but she still manages to appear lost on screen michael rooker can act i know this because i have witnessed it in days of thunder but he seems like he is reading his lines from cue cards has it come to this when rooker and lithgow have scenes together where they are speaking i just wanted the movie to end right there or have them both amazingly find their acting ability unfortunately neither of those things occurredwhich brings me back to harlin who can be the only one to really blame for this mess other than the screenwriters it is his fault that i was never drawn into this movie at all because he should have made the people actually act the script is not very good but still the actors performances are what destroys this movie and that has to lie with the director i do not care how much was paid for the special effects which for the most part are good you still cannot just sacrifice the movie with terrible acting plus the pacing of this movie seems to be off the opening sequence was good and the plane scene was very well done but how are you supposed to care about the outcome of the heist at all i mean i understand that they were trying to create tension with all of the bells and whistles of the plane scene but i really did not care if they got the money or not in that scene if the bad guys would have won early maybe i would not have had to witness one of the worst movies ever,0

schlocky seventys horror filmsya got to love them in contrast to todays boring slasher flicks these ktel specials actually do something scary and do not resort to a tired formulathis is a b movie about the making of a b moviethat went horribly wrong faith domergue this island earth stars as an overthehill b movie queen making a movie about a series of grisly murders that befell a family in their home her boyfrienddirector who looks and acts like gordon jump with an attitude is filming on location and on a tight schedule the ken doll costar discovers a book of tibetian chants that they work into the script to add realism unfortunately realism is something they could have done withoutjohn carradine having long since given up looking for the seventeenth gland the unearthly now eeks out a humble existence as the caretaker for the estate he goes about his daily work but always seems to run afoul of the directorthe horror builds slowly a dead cat here john carradine entering a grave there finally culminating in seven yes seven murders at least there is truth in advertising it is just sad that the ghoul did not understand that there was a movie being made above him how was poor faith to know that those darn tibetian chants would actually work face it you just cannot go around tugging on satans coat and expect him to take it lying downsterno says perform an autopsy on the house of seven corpses,0

this three stooges flick is at a tie with my other favorite flick disorder in the court this is an uproar of laughter for any three stooges fan to enjoythe boys are janitors at a recording studio when they hear the lovely christine mcintyre sings a great version of voices of spring she is going to be offered a record deal but she is scarred to be honest with her father about her choice of a career and prove herself as a real singer when she and the others leave the studio the stooges decide to have a little fun and play her record and dress curly up as christine the contract lady who can make christines career sees curly and mistakes him for christine and invites curly to sing for her party of course there is a man that they have upset that is at the party and they destroy his solo in front of the crowd so he will find a way to get back at themwhat a great stooge flick this should not be missed tenten,1
there is a lot going on in the college girl murders a mad scientist creates an almost undetectable poisonous gas before he can reap the rewards of his discovery the scientist is killed by a hooded whipwelding monk after a coed is killed in a church by the gas scotland yard is called in to investigate but the killing continues who can stop this mad killer who seems to be able to come and go as he pleases in and out of the college what works  the killer what is not to like about a killer who sneaks around wearing a vivid red kkk looking outfit complete with red gloves the white whip he carries and uses very effectively stands out nicely against the bright red gown although the idea of a killer in a flaming red pointyhead outfit sneaking around a girls school is fairly farfetched it is one of the more sinister looking costumes i have seen groovy sixtys music i really would like to track down the title music to the college girl murders it is got a jazzy hip sixtys feel to it that i just loved bizarre touches beyond the killers red gown and hood the movie features a sliding fireplace a pit of alligators with a cage handing overhead poison spraying bibles a strategically placed mannequin miniskirts gogo boots and mile high hair i would describe it as a cross between the sixtys batman tv show and an italian giallo the college girl murders is a real treat for the eye the end let us just say that there are more twists than a mountain road just when you think the killer has been uncovered here comes a twistand anotherand anotherand anotherwhat does not work  chief inspector sir john i know the guy was meant to be comic relief but his buffoonish character has way too much screen time why have alligators previously i mentioned the alligators in the pit and while they are a nice touch they serve very little purpose why go through all the trouble and not use them  plodding plot some of the college girl murders has no flow or rhythm to it there are far too many moments throughout the movie when things come inexplicably to a screeching halt better pacing would have made this a much more enjoyable moviei have not seen many of these german krimis but of the few i have seen phantom of soho strangler of blackmoor castle dead eyes of london this may be my favorite this one has a real funky feel to it that i really go into had the plot flowed a little better i could have easily given the college girl murders a seventen,1
first of all i liked very much the central idea of locating the  intruders others in the fragile self on various levels  mainly subconscious but sometimes more allegorical in fact the intruders are omnipresent throughout the film  in the swissfrench border where the pretagonist leads secluded life in the his recurring daydream and nightmare inside his ailing body after heart transplantation in the last half of the film he becomes intruder himself returning in ancient french colony in the hope of atoning for the past the overall tone is bitter rather than pathetic full of regrets and guilts sense of failure being more or less dominant this is a quite grim picture of an old age ostensibly selfdependent but hopelessly void and lonely inside the directer composes the images more to convey passing sensations of anxiety and desire than any explicit meanings some of them are mesmerizing not devoid of humor though kind of absurdist play only somnambulist can visualize,1
big spoilers i have seen one other takashi miike film and that was the very disturbing and brutal audition which was an examination of the japanese ideals of femininity in visitor q which i think means visitor question he examines in a very disturbingly gross way the family unit miikes surreal vision of a dysfunctional family almost tries to be lynchian in terms of confusion and filmmaking but ultimately lacks the style and intrigue we the audience are introduced to a bizarre array of scenarios from the opening scene with the father figure kenichi endo who was actually quite good paying for sex with his displaced daughter fujiko then as the father returns home he is struck on the head by the visitor kazushi watanabe wielding a fairly sizeable rock and for some reason they both end up back at the family home the mother shungiku uchida is beaten and bullied by her son jun muto who is also beaten and bullied by his school peers when the visitor enters the home he somewhat menacingly establishes himself as part of the unit eventually the family begin to improve their relationship with assistance from the visitor through milking breasts murder and retaining a sense of family prideand there are other crazy scenes that somehow bring the family closer together it is has uncomfortable humour but is equally frustratingly silly and overthetop in its weirdness there is a necrophiliac scene that is utterly disgusting but ends up being ridiculously funny as the scene progresses partly because of the situation itself and partly because you cannot believe the filmmakers and the actors are actually doing this the style of the film is poor to say the least and the plot is stupid and unbelievably weak the characters themselves are all over the place and while i understand this is not meant to be realistic there is hardly any interest in these confronting characters and situations as all of them border on the absurd the camerawork is sloppy and does not have that cinematic feel that lynchs work entails it is hard to take this film seriously on a surrealist level or on an interpretation of examining the family unit in japan it just seems that miike was out to shock and the film seems selfaware that it is trying to be shocking and it becomes almost comical to be taken seriously all in all i would say that this film is a bizarrely dark comedy but it looks and feels amateurish and seems to unnecessarily want to shock miikes previous film audition was finely balanced between disgusting horror character development and technique which established more intrigue in the way the film was crafted to allow the viewer to become engrossed with the plot visitor q is a step down as it tries too hard to be outlandishly bizarre and intentionally confronting without really having much to say in the process  out of ,0
i never fail to be amazed and horrified by the evil that has been predicated in the history of the world in the name of religion and it seems that the machinations of the catholic church in twentieth century ireland rank right up there near the top  considering that the wisdom of history and modern times should have had some sobering effecta love divided is the story of a real family scarred by ignorant intolerance and prejudice all in the name of an inane church doctrine at the beginning of the film we are offered a view of the bucolic life in a small irish village in which sheila and sean cloney are happily married with two young children sean is catholic and sheila is protestant but she has no qualms with their children being raised as catholic there is no sign of any animosity between the catholics and protestants in the village the peaceful and loving relationships are soon shattered when sheila expresses the desire to have their older child attend the protestant school the local priest takes it upon himself to forbid this sin and soon has sheilas husband and the entire catholic population of the village turned against her as well as her father the local dairy farmer in an act of defiance and desperation sheila kidnaps her two daughters and flees from the areaspecial note should be given to orla brady who plays sheila she gives an extremely powerful performance in which the viewer is drawn in to the emotional trauma in which she decides to reject the wishes of a husband she deeply loves in order to express her fervent desire to establish herself as independent from the pressures of the establishment on an equal footing is liam cunningham who plays sean for he gives a realistic portrait of a man not nearly as complex as his wife who is torn between his love for her and the influence of church and communityif fiction this film would have been a compelling and interesting drama considering it is true it changes to a horrific tragedy in real life the people and the village never fully recovered from the events that took place there it took almost half a century for the church to acknowledge its negative role in the events and even though sheila and sean lived out their lives in the area they never fully recovered from what was done to them by the religious leaders and their fellow villagerswhether it be denying basic rights to education of choice crashing planes into buildings subjugating women condemning whole races or just plain on torture and murder we humans certainly have the ability to use religion as a powerful negative force in our society,1
this is a typical example of technically highly skilled directors of video clipscommercials trying to do their first full feature length movie on one hand the imagery camera lighting cgi and even the sound are highly polished and have a truly expensive look and feel even the actors show a certain amount of potential  unto the point where even the best acting could not hide a bad plotin this case it is not a bad plot but hardly a plot at allso fifty of the dialog consists of what the hell was that  what was that  and what the hell was that  in none of the cases any of the characters nor the audience is provided with the slightest hint of an answer though in most of the other dialogues one gets the feeling that there never was any form of dialogue book and the actors had to freely improvise to a plot that was not ever explained to themthe only reason why skye bennets performance could be so good is that her character as an autistic girl did not allow giving her these tragically horrible dialogue lines the other actors had to deal with that way she was able to just show her acting talent which the rest of the cast could not even get close to i mean there is not one actor in the world that could make up for a dialogue like thisben is this real huh  emily stop it ben a mass psychosis huh  jon somebody has to take control of this situation ben this situation cannot be controlled not by you not by anybody emily not by you either ben nogot me goosebumps but not for horror more for the horrible attempt in some moments i felt ashamed for the actors to have added this to their vitatwo stars for the excellent technical work,0

this movie is a little ray of sunshine in a dark season it celebrates a quality best described as plain old friendliness morgan freeman plays a character very like freeman himselfa successful actor pushing seventy he has traveled to a small rather grimy grocery store intending to research a part he might play as a manager of such a place he soon beguiles the staff and the customers especially the lovely if cranky young woman paz vega who presides over the ten items or less checkout laneten items or less does not have a big statement to make and does not pretend that it does it follows freeman and vega as they become friendly and as the older man offers his counsel in exchange for a ride homethe moviecompany gofer who is supposed to pick him up never shows and freeman has forgotten his own phone number so he cannot call for help i had a little case of the blues on a gray sunday afternoon in new york city and this flick cured what ailed me,1
ladies and gentlemenplease do not get fooled by a stanley kubrick film tagthis is a very bad film which unfortunately has been hailed as one of the deadliest horror films ever madehorror films should create such a fear that during nights people should shiver their hearts out while thinking about a true horror filmin shiningthere is no real horror at all but what we find instead is just a naivefoolish attempt made to create chilling horroreveryone knows as to how good the attempts are if they are different from realityall that is good in the film is the view of the icy valley the hotel where most of the actors were lodged appears good tooa word about the actors jack nicholson looks like a lostlazy soul who is never really sure of what he is supposed to dothere is not much to be said of a baldcolored actor who for the most of times is busy pampering a kid actorno need to blame the bad weather for the tragedyit cannot be avoided as the film has been made and poor kubrick is not alive to make any changes,0
i cannot believe this movie was made as recently as one thousand nine hundred and eightyfour it is got some laughable acting not to mention one of the stupidest plots ever who would ever ask fat texas sheriff joe don baker to escort an italian he illegally arrested in mexico back to italy not to mention that the title of the movie tells you pretty much nothing about it  in fact it is about as generic a title for a wannabe actioncop film as i can think ofi am glad i only saw this on mstthreek with mike and the bots as a shield they remark on the female leads resemblance to elaine from seinfeld none of them are spongeworthy and riff nonstop on bakers weight this movie probably is not worse than mitchell but bakers reputation definitely precedes him here when his title comes up at the beginning of the film tom says i wish i was illiterate so i would not have to read that,0
the movie has a great written genre story it features all of the usual columbo ingredients the way lt columbo approaches and bonds to his suspect the way the mystery unravels for him columbos dog the cat and mouse play which is great in this one and luckily as well some good relieving humor mostly involving the columbo character it is all written despite the fact that it does not even have a truly original concept columbo hunting down a detectivemurder novel writer had been done more than once before in a columbo movieit is also an extremely well directed movie from james frawley who after this directed five more columbo movies in the seventys and eightys he provided the movie with style and some truly great and memorable sequencesit is one of the slower moving columbo movies despite not having a too long running time this style and approach does not always work out well for a columbo movie but in this movie it does which is perhaps not in the least thanks to the acting performances of the moviemost columbo movie either starred a big well known star or a star from the early days of filmmaking as the movie its murderer this movie stars the rather unknown eightyone year old ruth gordon she did not starred in an awful lot of movies throughout her career but she is still well known to some mostly for her role in rosemarys baby which also won her an oscar she had a realistic and somewhat unusual style of acting which some people might not like though it earned her four more oscar nominations throughout her career prior to her win for rosemarys baby in one thousand nine hundred and sixtynine she has some great interaction as well with peter falk in their sequences togetherthe movie also stars a still young gd spradlin i say young because i only know him from his latest productions out of his career despite the fact that he already was fiftyseven at the time of this columbo production he is still alive but retired from acting ever since one thousand nine hundred and ninetyninean even better than usual columbo movie entryeightten,1
admittedly i find al pacino to be a guilty pleasure he was a fine actor until scent of a woman where he apparently overdosed on himself irreparably i hoped this film of which i would heard almost nothing growing up would be a nice little gem an overlooked aheadofitstime intelligent and engaging citypolitical thriller it is notcity hall is a movie that clouds its plot with so many characters names and realistic citywide issues that for a while you think its a plot in scope so broad and implicating that once you find out the truth it will blow your mind in truth however these subplots and digressions result ultimately in fairly tame and very familiar urban story trademarks such as corruption of power twofaced politicians mafia with police ties etc and theoretically this setup allows for some thrilling tension the fear that none of the characters are safe and anything could happen but again it really does notunfortunately the only things that happen are quite predictable and we are left with several confession monologues that are meant as a whole to form modern a fable of sorts a lesson in the moral ambiguity of the real world of politics and society but after one hundred and ten minutes of names and missing reports and a spiderweb of lies and coverups the audience is usually treated to a somewhat satisfying reveal i do not think we are left with that in city hall and while it is a very full film i do not find it altogether rich,0
let us begin with that theme song sung by christopher cross the song is if you get caught between the moon and new york city it is a great theme and song even after all these years it never gets tiring it really is a great song about new york city as well anyway the great dudley moore cbe stars as a spoiled drunken millionaire who is engaged to jill eikenberrys character in the film jill would later star on la law anyway he is served by his wonderful british butler sir john gielgud om who won an academy award for his performance in the film as best supporting actor arthur falls in love with liza minnellis character who is perfect in this film besides her performance in her oscar winning role in cabaret no liza does not get to sing she plays a diner waitress anyway i love geraldine fitzgerald as the bach matriarch of the family who decides the familys fortune anyway she is fabulous and should have gotten an academy award nomination herself for best supporting actress barney martin best known as jerrys dad on seinfeld plays lizas dad he is great too the movie was wellwritten acted and delivered to the audience who wanted more of it,1
this has the absolute worst performance from robert duval who sounds just like william buckley throughout the entire film his hammy melodramatic acting takes away from any dramatic interest i am not sure if this was deliberate scene stealing or inadvertent but it is the only thing i can recall from a truly forgettable film this picture should be shown in every amateur acting class of an example of what not to do thank god duvall went on to bigger and better things and stopped trying to effect a cultured accent he is a good character actor but that is about it klaus is so much better his performance is muted and noteworthy,0
this film is a wonderful movie based on the life of a man called grey owl in one thousand nine hundred and thirtys canada i found it to be similarly riveting and heartfelt as rudy and awakenings it picks up late in grey owls life and follows him through his most tumultuous and influential periodthe film is about a canadian indian trapper who finds himself promoting the plight of the overtrapped beaver he also predicts the decrease in natural lands and the overuse of earths resources this is an outrageous concept in the one thousand nine hundred and thirtys and surprisingly well received he becomes a well known speaker and the masses are ready to listenthe casting of pierce brosnan seems rather odd but is not outrageous anyone wanting to argue that point must first watch the movie to understand brosnan provides a wonderful performance as does annie galipeau galipeau is a strong actress whose place beside brosnan is refreshingly natural compared to the forced pairings in recent bond filmsi would recommend this film to anyone interested in good drama beautiful scenery or environmental causes it is a movie for families as well however children under ten depending on maturity would have trouble following the plot,1
i really cannot remember who recommended this but they said it was one of their favorite films it is certainly a strange one  like rubbernecking at a highway accidentsomeone said that truth is stranger than fiction and the truth here is something to see i really cannot understand how a fictionalized account of this documentary is to be released this year how can you improve on this the aunt and cousin of jackie kennedy remove themselves from new york society and hide in the hamptons in the process they become recluses and what is best described as crazy cat ladies they would have stayed hidden had not the city move to condemn the property for the filth and the subsequent rescue by jackie this film was done after that rescue all during you could not help but think how bad was it before it is a look at high society from the darker side and it is utterly fascinating,1
i was so looking forward to seeing this when it was in productionbut it turned out to be the the biggest let down a far cry from the whimsical world of dr seuss it was vulgar and distasteful i do not think dr seuss would have approvedhow the grinch stole christmas was much better i understand it had some subtle adult jokes in it but my children have yet to catch on whereas the cat in the hat screamed vulgarity they caught a lot more than i would have likedgrowing up with dr seuss it really bothered me to see how this timeless classic got trashed on the big screen let us see what they do with horton hears a whoi hope this one does dr seuss some justice,0
oh my god this movie insults the intelligence of everybody i mean really who thinks three kids can fight thirty to forty ninjas and win not to mention the brainless humor thrown in this film is baaaaaaaaaaaaaad the movie is an omen the only thing it is good for is a time killer or unintentional laughs,0
a stage company cast finds themselves terrified when a bizarre killer known as the fiend targets them for death a pair of reporters and their clumsy photographer set out to work the story of the fiend and find themselves targets as well just as you think our trio of heroes has the case solved you are thrown another twist that has you wondering who the killer really is according to the dvd sleeves synopsistaking the hunchback of notre dame to hollywood producer sam katzmans lack of studio settings probably helps a face in the fog look interesting especially toward the end one thousand nine hundred and thirtys traffic the direction could be improved upon for example the camera angle on the fight scene is not helpful the budget appears slight under the circumstances most of the silenttalkie crossover cast perform it amiably a face in the fog twoonethirtysix robert f hill  lloyd hughes june collyer al st john,0
 for paris is a moveable feast ernest hemingwayit is impossible to count how many great talents have immortalized paris in paintings novels songs poems short but unforgettable quotes and yes  movies the celebrated film director max ophüls said about paris it offered the shining wet boulevards under the street lights breakfast in montmartre with cognac in your glass coffee and lukewarm brioche gigolos and prostitutes at night everyone in the world has two fatherlands his own and paris paris is always associated with love and romance and paris je taime which is subtitled petite romances is a collection of short films often sketches from eighteen talented directors from all over the world in each we become familiar with one of the city of light twenty arrondissements and with the parisians of all ages genders colors and backgrounds who all deal in love in its many variations and stages in some of the petite romances we are the witnesses of the unexpected encounters of the strangers that lead to instant interest closeness and perhaps relationship like for podalydès and florence muller in the street of montmartre in the opening film or for cyril descours and leïla bekhti as a white boy and a muslim girl whose crosscultural romance directed by gurinder chadha begins on quais de seine i would include into this category the humorous short film by gus van sant in le marais one boy pours his heart out to another boy confessing of sudden unexpected closeness asking permission to call  never realizing that the object of his interest does not understand frenchsome of the vignettes are poignant and even dark in walter salles and daniela thomas loin du sixteenème catalina sandino mareno amazing oscar nominated debut for maria full of grace is single workingclass mother who has to work as a nanny in a wealthy neighborhood to pay for daycare where she drops her baby every morning before she goes to work one of most memorable and truly heartbreaking films is place des fêtes by oliver schmitz aïssa maïga and seydou boro costar as two young people for who love could have happened there were the promises of it but it was cut short due to hatred and intolerance that are present everywhere and the city of love and light is no exception another one that really got to me was bastille written and directed by isabel coixet starring sergio castellitto miranda richardson and leonor watling castellitto has fallen out of love with his wife richardson but when he is ready to leave with the beautiful mistress the devastating news from his wifes doctor arrivesi can go on reflecting on all eighteen small gems i like some of them very much the others felt weak and perhaps will be forgotten soon but overall i am very glad that i bought the dvd and i know that i will return to my favorite films again and again they are place des fêtes that i have mentioned already pèrelachaise directed by wes craven that involves the ghost of one of the wittiest and cleverest men ever oscar wilde alexander payne the director of sideways who would save one troubled relationship payne also directed fourteenth arrondissement in which a lonely middleaged postworker from denver co explores the city on her own providing the voice over in french with the heavy accent paynes entry is one of the most moving and along with hilarious tuileries by joel and ethan coen with who else  steve buschemi is my absolute favorite in both shorts american tourists sit on the benches margo in the park and steve in paris metro after visiting louvers observing the life around them with the different results while margo may say my feelings sad and light my sorrow is bright steves character will find out that sometimes even the most comprehensive and useful tourist guide would not help a tourist avoiding doing the wrong things in a foreign country,1
i have wanted to see this for the longest time james merendino is a great director slc punk is one of my favorite movies and in the first ten minutes of this film i thought that it was a great follow up after that though it begins to drag the acting and direction were terrific in fact everything in the film seemed to flow except for the script at times the only thing keeping my attention was the fact that in the cast was the most beautiful woman in the world claire forlani this film was good but i expected moreps look for great cameos by chi mcbride and chris mcdonald,1
this is bar none the most hilarious movie i have ever seen beginning with the four delinquents being sent off by their fathers to wienberg military academy a tone is set that steadily continues all throughout this goofball film and it does not let up for a secondit is tough trying to describe this film the humor elements are so spot on and brilliantly concieved that upon a first look it appears as nothing more than a stupid eightys teen lust comedy but it is oh so much more than that fresh from the minds of those folks over at mad magazine up the academy serves up a formula and style that i have never since seen duplicated by any of the funniest offerings to come out of hollywood in years past basically the film is so full of infantile cornball material that you might guess that the writers were a couple of fourteen year olds themselves see this movie if you love to act immature a classic ,1
i must admit  the only reason i bought this movie was because i am a big fan of gackt and a huge fan of hyde i was expecting a good movie with a lot of shots that were shall we say pleasing to the feminine eye but a slightly cheesy story i mean the synopsis sounded really out there and now that i have just finished watching it  i feel the need to tell the world of its brilliance hyde and gackt both gave heartwrenching performances and my eyes are still hot from the crying that lasted throughout the last half of the movie you get sucked into the story and you really feel for the characters by the end the element of vampirism  which i love but is very easy to overdo or to ruin a movie with  is subtly mixed into the storyline as to make it something merely exotic normal to this setting rather than a random unnecessary addition to the story i ranked it at a nine out of ten at firstand then i went back and tried to think of why i was not giving it that last point came up with nothing so a ten out of ten it is after all  i am not much of a critic  the fact that i am bothering to write a review at all means i either really hate the movie or really love it you can tell what side i am on with moon child,1
this movie is just great if you have a chance to see it then you should run to see it even though the movie has almost nothing to do with its original from one thousand nine hundred and thirtytwo pacino does a great job playing as tony montana to get around pacino has this way about him where he can say anything in anyway and make it sound just great if you thought that pulp fiction was good with the swear words if you saw it then you should also see scarface to see another angle at how an actor can say them its quite sweet even though the movie is has a lot of action and the plot moves very fast through time not keeping the realtime aspect ratio correct it is still easy to follow along but you must keep your eyes peeled at all times to not lose anything personally i have found that watching this movie makes three hours seem like a breeze it is really just that great this movie is one of thoe movies that is acted and directed so well that not only do you forget that this movie was made in the crappy eightys but that it makes you actually root for the bad guy so say good night to the bad guy,1
i stumbled across this acti by pure dumb luck and this was more than a decade ago this wasnt even what the cover label on the tape mentioned it amazed me it intimidated me it shocked me i eventually forgot about and almost a decade later i happened to think about it again then went and bought both acts they were even better than i had experienced at firstmy only complaint is that while the tank police keep on going on and on about being at war with crime warranting tanks and heavy artillery it would seem as though they are really having a hard time with criminals that is either never shown or is simply a lie as they appear to be taking it easy most of the time if that bit about being in a state of war was really propaganda it certainly has not been shown as suchi do not think the original japanese version could have been any where as good as the americanized version of this but regarding the story there has certainly been some proper explanations lost in translation but it can be excused,1
chris rock stars in this remake of warren beattys heaven can wait itself a remake of the one thousand nine hundred and fortyone film here comes mr jordan a comedy about a man who dies before his time before he can realize his dreams and his adventures in his new albeit temporary body in the beatty version the protagonist was a backup quarterback for the thenlos angeles rams in rocks hipper version our lead character is a struggling young  and decidedly lowtalent  standup comedianit is very funny to see the razorsharp rock playing a bad comedian it is kind of like seeing tom hanks play a bad actor lance bartons dream is to play the legendary apollo theater on a nonamateur night but every time he tries out his material he is booed off the stage lustily  so much so that his nickname becomes booie his jokes are lame his delivery painful in short lance is everything that the real chris rock is notlance is also a bike messenger and he is riding the streets on his way to try out even more material when bam he is hit by a truck ok so maybe he was taken from his body a tenth of a second early by a slightly incompetent angel eugene levy but hey he was going to get hit anyway no dice it appears lance is not due in heaven until two thousand and fortyfour so what to do mr king chazz palminteri the manager of heaven reluctantly agrees to find a new body for the notquitedead mr barton trouble is the body they find is of a greedy old white man turns out this fella a mr wellington owns all kinds of things  he is the fifteenth richest man in the country what luck you can imagine how lance will turn things around but of course while in the body of the affluent mr wellington lance falls for a gorgeous hospital worker regina king we males know how tough it is to find a female given our own body but try winning one over while you are an dumpy old white guy and it is even worse when she is not impressed by your money this is rocks first shot at a lead role and in my opinion he performs admirably there is still a lot of the standup comedian in him  and of course if he ever wants to get diverse roles he might have to stop incorporating standup routines into the script  but this is not really a bad thing rocks personality  his drive his delivery his demeanor and his passion  are what fuel this film he is clearly having a lot of fun in the role and he seems bent on making sure you have fun watching him,1
i got the first bill and ted movie for christmas and i had to get the second when i saw it in a store this one was i think just as funny as the first but a much wierder story it was funny how they had their own personnal hell and how they had to play death the funny thing was that they played him in stupid little games like clue the only thing i would change is station and death being in the band but other than that it was great,1
someone must have been seriously joking when they made this filmfirstly it is an absolute impossibility that this movie was made in one thousand nine hundred and ninetythree the fashions and music dictate that this is seriously eightys my guess is that this has sat on the shelf for a long while before some crazed distributer picked it up and released it to a disbelieving worldthere is a plot kind of a strange loner meets a random man with a beard who tells him that if he meditates while singing his favourite song he will be able to turn into whomever he chooses at this point i feel obliged to point out that the loners favourite song is london bridge is falling down why is this his favourite song because he is an idiot we are only a minute into the film and already the film has reached a monumental level of stupidity it gets even stupiderthe loner is the nostril picker i can only assume this as there are two scenes in the film where he is seen picking his nose that clears up the title he decides to change into a girl so that he can get close to other girls and kill them that is more or less itthe acting is universally appalling every single performance in this movie sucks in fact i would go so far as to say that the acting is of the standard of a pornographic movie it really is that terrible the nostril picker appears to the audience as the nostril picker the characters in the movie see him as the girl he has become through singing london bridge is falling down man i feel like an idiot even typing this anyway it is kind of strange seeing a middle aged weirdo hanging out with school girls and not in a good way there is even an extended montage of scenes where the nostril picker is at school with the girls and a song plays over the top it is very possibly the worst song ever recorded i am not even going to describe it you will know it when you hear it and you will agree with methere are some scenes of violence sure and there is a benny hill style chase sequence involving a transsexual there is even an immortal bit of dialogue that may or may not have been taken from shakespeare or john milton where the nostril picker says to a prostitute i have got the cash if you have got the gash lovely i am sure you will agreeutter nonsense,0
a wonderful film by powell and pressburger whose work i now want to explore more the film is about what we perceive as real and what is real and how the two can be so difficult to distinguish from one another beautifully shot and acted although david niven does not seem to be twentyseven years old as his character claims to be fun to see a very young richard attenborough this film made me think while i was watching it and afterwards,1
if you want to learn the basics of quantum mechanics spend your nine on a used textbook not this movie i am a little worried that the money i spent is being used to buy koolaid for shipment to guyana i do not think the directors really got any point across but it looks like maybe they were trying to make several one science can explain everything we do meaning that our lives are deterministic two science cannot be used to explain everything we do meaning that we have free will three science is like really cool brother four we are god five the world exists only in our minds six sarah norman is a tough role to follow and seven here put this tiny paper square in your mouth and you will see some really groovy stuff,0
this is the kind of movie i fear the most arrogant and irresponsible it presents a sketch of the colombian conflict so cliched and dumb it represents an insult to all colombian people the performances are godawul from grisales her naked scene is absolutely pitiful to bejarano to fanny mickey who looks right out of a tim burton nightmare to díaz who makes a notable effort to bring life to a character so onedimensional so cliched and so badly written all he´s left to work with is a mustache not to mention the gratuitous ending a gore fest so cheesy that it would make ed wood cringe it fails in all ways cinematography art direction costumes makeup editing and most of all directing jorge alí triana has always been a lousy filmmaker but at least his previous movies had some dignity i cannot say anything good about this waste of money except that i hope colombian filmmakers learn a lesson about honesty integrity and responsability from this meanintended fiasco,0
i have to start by telling you how i came across this movieit was winter time in alaska around the year one thousand nine hundred and ninetya friend of mine from australia was staying with me and my girl friend in a shoe box of an apartmentwinters in alaska can be a bit brutal and most people stay indoorsdrink heavily and watch anything that comes on the televisioni had found this movie outside of a thrift store laying in a snowbank and right away new it was a treasureit is quite possibly the best worst movie everwe spent the next two weeks watching this movie and drinking like fishwe watched it so many times in fact that we would sometimes turn the television on its side or upside down for a more full filling effectit is a true gemthe laughs will come nonstop and the memories last foreverif you see this movie for rent in a video storesteal ityou will not regret it,1
i thought that the sentinel was going to be a mediocre moviewhen i finally saw iti took a good surprisethe movie is not great thing but it is very fun and the action scenes are very well donethis movie reminded me tv series like twentyfour or aliasit is very similar to that series and it reminded me tooto the wolfgang petersens thriller in the line of fireif you are going to expect one of the most original and and one of the greatest thrillers in the history of moviesyou will be disappointedbut if you go with little expectationsyou will enjoy the sentinelratingseven,1
you want to see the movie the gamers by dead gentlemen productions this is not that movie this movie is not funny it is a waste of timeall of the good comments here seem to be written by poorly disguised false third parties the people who made this movie seem to be attempting to synthesize fake interestthis movie is not a well done mockumentary comparisons to spinal tap or christopher guest are insultingthe movie is so meanspirited that i cannot imagine anyone familiar with the subject matter finding it funny being able to laugh at yourself is an important quality but if you are the ones being lampooned in this manner you would have to hate yourself to enjoy itthe movie is not offensive because of its grand satire of taboo topics but because of its constant pathetic banality,0
this has to be one of my favourite movies of all time the dialogue with the constant use of puns is very tight the cast are superb and the plot is highly originaldo not take my word for it  watch this movie and enjoy it for yourself,1
there is enough star power in the house of spirits to create another galaxy yet the final product is pretty debatable the film and its messages are very noble and i think perhaps most would agree with them liberal democracy good violent fascist regime bad openmindedness good racism bad etc unfortunately we are battered from head to toe with these and as much subtlety is used as i have described them ultimately we are left watching very noble people without any flaws squaring off with nasty cretins who have no redeeming qualities it radiates with all the suspense of a badly orchestrated pro wrestling matchjeremy irons plays the patron a man of many contradictions meryl streep as his gifted bride and glenn close as her sister in law when the camera stays with these folks the movie tends to move and is quite enjoyable unfortunately the house of spirits engages with simply way too many subplots and characters pop up and out of the picture like shooting gallery targets we do not get to know them hence we do not get to care for them the result is boredom if bille august the director and screenwriter from isabel allendes book had either lengthened the film or snipped a few characters this film might have worked completely as it stands it was a nice try with nice messages and a bonecrushing yawnfestnot recommended,0
this was the first regular filmed columbo movie episode but yet it aired as the second after steven spielbergs columbo murder by the book it is also at the same time among one of the better onesbernard l kowalski was one great creative director no wonder that they later asked him to direct three more columbo movies the movie has some real creative and innovative shot sequences and the movie as a whole is also clearly made with style passion and eye for detail every shot connects and is a reason why this movie is better and also better looking just any other average made for tv movie it is definitely one of the better directed columbo moviesit is a quit original columbo entry for a couple of reasons the murder is more or less an accident and was an impulsive act so the killer this time does not have any time to plan out the perfect murder in advance and his to clean up any of the traces afterward and has to dispose the body the killer in this movie is not only being handled as the man who committed the crime but more as the man who helps out lieutenant columbo to solve the murder it makes the character a more interesting and layered one as well and also helps to make the way columbo solves the whole crime seem way more interesting as well because of that of course columbo starts to suspect him pretty early on and as always he comes to solution by making himself vulnerable and look more stupid than he of course truly is and by gaining the killers trust this is obviously no spoiler since this is the way every columbo movie gets setup i liked the story of the movie and how it progressedit also helps the movie that it has such a fine cast at the time of this movie peter falk had really made the columbo character his own and the character at this was already fully developed robert culp is truly great as the short tempered brimmer funny thing is that he would later star in three different columbo movies again and one mrs columbo episode only in totally different roles he even played the murderer in a couple of those movies as well again he by the way was not the only actor that did this in other later columbo movies also the great ray milland makes an appearance in this movie as the husband of the victimall in all a real great early columbo movie and among the better ones out of the long running series of moviesnineten,1
sandra bernhard is quite a character and certainly one of the funniest women on earth she began as a standup comedienne in the one thousand nine hundred and seventys but her big break came in one thousand nine hundred and eightythree when she starred opposite jerry lewis and robert de niro in scorseses underrated masterpiece the king of comedy her film career never quite took off though she did make a couple of odd but entertaining pictures such as dallas doll one thousand nine hundred and ninetyfour or dinner rush two thousand but the most amazing parts were those she created for herselfwithout you i am nothing is undoubtedly her best effort it is an adaptation of her smashhit offbroadway show which made her a superstar  and madonnas best friend for about four years in ten perfectly choreographed and staged scenes sandra turns from nina simone to diana ross talks about her childhood andy warhol and san francisco and performs songs made famous by burt bacharach prince or sylvester director john boskovich got sandra to do a ninetyminute tourdeforce performance that is both sexy and uniquely funny if you are a bernhard fan you cannot miss out this film it is a tribute as well to her weird beauty as to her extremely unconventional talent as a comedienne and it has influenced filmmakers in their work  hedwig and the angry inch for instance would look a lot different if without you i am nothing did not exist,1
picked this up for fifty cents at the flea market was pretty excitedi found it fascinating for about fifteen min then just repetitive and dullit is neat seeing mick and the gang in their prime i wish there was not so much over dubbing of dialog so i could hear what there are saying and playingthe skits are politically dated and incredibly naive and simple sort of poorly written monty python on acid i spent more time looking at the late sixtys england back drops rather then what was actually happening in the silly skitsthis movie is a good reminder that times really changeand what was important quickly becomes just plain silly good song but it has now been played to death by this dvd,0
i have just purchased the restored version of a film that i remember with much affection from childhood and it is certainly made for a curious afternoons entertainment bedknobs definitely makes more sense in its complete form the deleted scenes especially those with mcdowall link events together quite neatly what is a little disconcerting is the way the scenes have been remastered clearly the soundtrack to this footage had been lost or damaged so some bright spark at disney decided to dub the scenes with new dialogue which would have been great except that half the cast were not around to do it some for better reasons than others and the whole thing has a rather shoddy quality to it some of the lipsynching is pretty poor and david tomlinsons voice has been dubbed by a bloke who sounds absolutely nothing like david tomlinson there is actually a hint of german in it i think however good to hear the full versions of all the songs although step in the right direction is still absent and the moments of magic in this film still shine through and i challenge you not to giggle when young paul gazes so innocently at angela lansbury and coos but what is that got to do with my knob,1
i am decidedly not in the target audience for this film i am a man nearly fifty who has only recently stumbled across the world of independent film this happened quite by accident with the discovery of a movie called clerks late one night on television the first two things i noticed about that film were that it was one technically amateurish and two brilliantly written when i read an interview with the director in the local paper and he said that one of his influences was clerks i started to get interesting when he said his main influence was the station agent a movie i would seen on dvd a week prior i decided i had to go and check it out the result could be described along the same lines as clerks although the two films are nothing alike content wise both films suffer from technical gaffes that are overcome through amazing writing whereas clerks is a day in the life of a man who has nothing in his life at all and is afraid to ask tough questions about himself and his situation less like me is about a man who seemingly forces himself to be constantly busy he is always running one way or another filling his life with little things so that he will never have to deal with the big ones the themes and ideas of this film are strong and poignant i can tell from watching it that not much has changed since i was growing up young men still have the same problems they always have the writer dresses up these problems and themes in the modern vernacular crafts wonderfully honest characters and has them do completely believable things as far as indie cinema goes this may not be perfect from a technical standpoint but from an artistic one it is very close,1
i went into this movie after having read it was a drama about a man with a supernatural gift who was made into a monster by society suffice to say i was expecting something entirely different from what i got but it was a happy surprise my friend and i both thought the movie was very romantic the fact that the male lead is not bad to look at surely helped and there was enough plot development action and even humor the fact that it takes them until the threerd part of the movie to now each others name had the whole movietheatre laughing to keep you entertained and invested in the story so in short not what i expected but a very good surprise indeed i will definitely buy this movie when it comes out on dvd,1
on the back burner for years so it was reported this television reunion of two of the most beloved characters in sitcom history started off badly  and went straight downhill from there mary richards mary tyler moore and her best friend rhoda morgenstern valerie harper meet in new york after a long estrangement and catch up on each others lives what a novel concept but sad to relate nothing worth talking about let alone making a movie about has happened to either of them in the intervening years so instead the script contents itself with throwing out one hoary old plot device after another most having to do with older women in the workplace while completely missing the quirky charm and sophistication that made the original show a winner the supporting cast is instantly forgettable the humor is nonexistent and the chemistry which moore and harper once had together is gone moore allegedly stalled this project for years waiting for just the right script before committing herself if this was the one she considered right what on earth were the ones she turned down like it is not the age of the characters that does this in for time inevitably marches on but the almost complete lack of imagination coupled with a blatant disregard for the elements that made the series work at one time this was intended as a pilot but all to obviously it failed to generate any interest among potential sponsors or for that matter among potential audiences quickly and mercifully forgotten the film is a travesty and an insult to a classic,0
i think that this is possibly the funniest movie i have ever seen robert harlings script is near perfect just check out the quotes section on second thought just rent the dvd since it is the delivery that really makes the lines singsally field gives a comic overthetop performance like you have never seen from her anywhere else and kevin kline is effortlessly hilarious robert downey jr is typically brilliant and in a very small role kathy najimy is a riot as the beleaguered costumer i was never much of a fan of elisabeth shue but she is great here as the one real person surrounded by a bevy of cartoon characters on the set of the sun also sets  that rumbling you feel beneath you is hemingway rolling over in his grave either that or he is laughing really hardfive stars funny funny funny,1
monty berman and dennis spooner followed up the baron with this a fantasy series about three superhuman spies which preempted the six million dollar man it was a favourite of mine when i was a youngster and i enjoy watching it still stuart damon and william gaunt had an unmistakable onscreen chemistry as craig stirling and richard barrett while the luscious alexandra bastedo pouted her way through her role as sharron macready the late anthony nicholls made a wonderfully gruff tremayne by far the best episodes were those written by tony williamson terry nation and brian clemens while spooners own the interrogation compared favourably with the prisoner i regret that there was never a second series the concept had so much life left in it would craig and richard have been competitors for sharrons affections what if tremayne had learned of the champions powers did the champions have any other abilities other than those we saw we never found out alas,1
this film is definitely an odd love story though this film may not be much to shout about nicole kidman carries the film on her own the rest of the cast could quite easily be forgotten though ben chaplin does do quite a good job of hertfordshire life with shots of st albans  hemel hempstead town centre depicting the true essence of the area what starts outlooking like a regular episode of the popular british tv seriesheartbeat soon turns into a gritty gangster getaway action flicknothing truly memorable happens in this simple small film and thus endsup as fairly decent weekend entertainment a good one to watch and if you like the hero john are lonely thirty something you may find something to identify with in his character,1
i guess that everyone has to make a comeback at some point and that is exactly what embarrassed taft resident jack dundee robin williams intends to do in the best of times yep the man who went all crazy with the radio in good morning vietnam is playing football in this case he seeks to replay a game that cost his high school a prestigious title but exteammate reno hightower kurt russell is not just going to go along with it so easilygranted it is not the best movie for either man but williams and russell are actually a pretty good comedy team and some of the names in this movie are likely to give you the giggles to say the least check it out,1
please avoid this movie at all costs this is without a doubt the worst movie i have ever seen most movies have at least one redeeming value this has none totally horrible,0
in a summer that also boasted such repugnant stinkers as snakes on a plane and the da vinci code that is a pretty bold statement but i stand by it nonetheless superman returns like king kong six months before it is overlong hyperindulgent and with cgi up to the eyeballs my god this stuff is doing my head inrichard donner had the idea of keep it real for his two outings and i do find his approach to the special and optical effects to be the most appropriate brian singer bombards us with so much cgi that it really takes you out of the story and constantly reminds you that you are watching a wannabe blockbuster that thinks that the only way to impress an audience is to spend two hundred and fifty million a totally irresponsible amount of money on obnoxious visual effects that do not live up to the hype we have seen everything and been everywhere that cgi can take us there is no real atmosphere or involvement in this and for a film that is ninetyfive made up of this crapwell you figure it outi have read so many reviews from fanboy critics about how the movie has soul or a human heart or tender character moments puhlease we have already had brooding superheros silently screaming you would love me if you knew who i am dozens of times already in recent years and sr offers absolutely nothing new in this regard even the plot is recycled garbage lex luthor a seriously miscast and hammy kevin spacey plotting to destroy the landmass of america was done in the first film already and wellthat is your lot it is amazing that they managed to draw out this junk to twofive painful hours even if the cast were likable it would make it less unbearable but brandon routh has the on screen personality of a mahogany hatstand kate bosworth is completely unconvincing as a pulitzer prizewinning journalist james marsden is two hundred and fifty wooden as usual and kevin spacey really needs to either fire his agent or acquire some better judgement the only cast member i liked was the lovely parker posey but i am into weirdlooking girlsevery year films like this get bigger and more bombastic pretty soon we will have three hundred million films studios need to realise that maybe they should start looking down instead of looking up for all the money that warner spent on this pile of crap for all the resources that this movie cost to makewas it worth it in my opinion certainly not this garbage has put me of superman for life,0
i had just reached thirteen when i first saw this series and i am watching it again on dvd over thirty years later the pictures over the opening credits have never left me it has affected my view of the world and the peoples in it my parents were with me long enough to have seen the series with me and we always discussed the programme afterwards it gave me a love for studying history and the highest marks i got in our schools public examssir laurence oliviers voice and delivery is timeless and perfect i get the feeling that the people who lived through it would feel that this is their version of the history of the second world war i cannot imagine ever getting bored looking at it maybe an similar cold war series could now be contemplated although who could replace sir laurence is difficult to imaginebuy it,1
mario lewis of the competitive enterprise institute has written a definitive one hundred and twentypage pointbypoint linebyline refutation of this mendacious film which should be titled a convenient lie the website address where his debunking report which is titled a skeptics guide to an inconvenient truth can be found at is  a shorter tenpage version can be found at  once you read those demolitions you will realize that alleged global warming is no more real or dangerous than the ytwok scare of one thousand nine hundred and ninetynine which gore also endorsed as he did the pseudoscientific film the day after tomorrow which was based on a book written by alleged ufo abductee whitley strieber as james the amazing randi does to psychics and philip klass does to ufos and gerald posner does to jfk conspiridiocy theories so does mario lewis does to al gores movie and the whole global warming scam,0
scott henderson alan curtis is unjustly accused of killing his unfaithful wife the night she was murdered he was out with a mystery woman who refused to give him her name after accused of the murder the police visit all the places he had been with her but people only remember him being alone he is sentenced to die and his secretary ella raines sets out to find the murderer herself because she loves himthis was made as a b film from universal look at the castall character actors and one starfranchot toneon the decline the budget was small and the cast mostly unknown but what came out is one of the best film noirs of the one thousand nine hundred and fortys it is beautifully directed by curt siodmak and has a fantastic script that came from an excellent book by william irish a pen name for cornell woolrich it moves quickly and just looks fantastic and there is the infamous jam session with raines and elisha cook jr which just comes off the screen with incredible sexual energy i am surprised the censors did not cut itthere are only a few flaws that prevent this from being perfect tone gives a dreadful performance he looks ghastly and he is just horrible also curtis is stiff and bland as henderson you really wonder why raines loves himhe is so unemotional but raines is pretty good in the lead role she is pretty and full of life also the last scene when the murderer is after her never rings true he is hardly a threat physically and her reactions just seem overstatedstill i am giving this a nine a really great filmflaws aside,1
whoever gave this movie rave reviews needs to see more moviesa loser takes his camera and photographs his mental family the movie is filled with idiots and includes live teabagging that should sum it all up for youdo not waste your time you may want to watch the entire movie in the hopes that it gets better as it goes on  it does not,0
i was really excited about seeing this film i thought finally australia had made a good film but i was wrongthis was the most pathetic attempt at a slasher film ever i feel sorry for molly ringwald having to come all the way to australia to make an awful moviethe acting was terrible especially that australian guy who was trying to speak in an american accent and the plot was also pretty badwhen i first heard about this film coming out i thought that the title was pathetic because it sounds like the cheesy film stab in scream two but i was willing to let it slide if it was a good moviewarning major spoilersprobably the worst thing about the film was the ending i was expecting a big surprise about who the killer was but the killer was not even human which turned this realistic slasher film into an awful horror moviedo not see this film you will probably be disappointed,1
of the three remakes of this plot i like them all i have all three on vhs and in addition have a copy of this one on dvd there is just enough variation in the scripts to make all three entertaining and rewatchable in addition has any other film been remade three times with such all star casts in each of course the main stars in this one are great but the supporting actors are also superb i particularly like william tracy as pepi he was such a scene stealer that i have searched to find other movies he is in he appeared in many but most are not available as the other comments i also say  buy this one,1
if this film had a budget of twenty million i would just like to know where the money went a monkey could make better cgi effects then what was wasted for three hours on this dreadful piece of garbage although i must admit the machines and the martians would have looked really really cool on an original playstation one game and early pc games from the mid ninetys if a game had ever been made what puzzles me is where did the money go pendragon films could have made a great film with good old fashioned models and computer controlled cameras a la george lucas circa one thousand nine hundred and seventyfiveeightythree and actors who actually look like they care about what they are doing or ruining in this case for about the same twenty million this is quite possibly the worst film ever made i would rather sit through a twentyfour hour repeat screening of ishtar than watch this film again i hated it completely i regress i say this is the worst film ever made because unlike other bad movies like plan nine or killer tomatoes or santa claus conquers the martians these are films that are so bad you have a special place in your heart for them you love them there is no love for this film and no place in my dvd library for it i sold it to a guy for a dollar i am betting the money for the film was spent on booze and other vices for the cast and crew shame on you pendragon films i want my money back,0

i love watching early colour films  you mean those fortys clothes were not all grey margaret rutherford dominates this movie her eccentric garb is actually rather attractive and yes she has an amazing hourglass figure but i feel she was given her head rather too much she probably developed this characterisation over many performances and nobody told her if it gets a laugh leave it out she does too much deranged fooling about when she is supposed to be surprisingly down to earth the madame arcati joke is that mediums were usually portrayed as wispy females in long drapery arcati behaves like a retired headmistress we will really put our backs into it the contrast between her breezy commonplace manner and her wacky beliefs is not really brought outjust because all the actors are english apart from cummings the americans feel they have to use the words brit stiff lip and upper oh give it a rest the three main characters lose their tempers constantly and make risqué remarks did he make love to you yes but very discreetly  he was in the cavalry,0
a fantastic show and an unrealized classic the league of gentlemen remains as one of the greatest modern comedies of recent timeswith a dark and bizarre style of humor that towers over the tired formulaic approach of it is inferior yet unfortunately far more acknowledged successor little britain the league of gentlemen was truly something special during a rather quiet era in british comedyup until it is arrival on the scene there had never really been anything like the league of gentlemen before on the surface a seemingly simplistic sketch show the show soon unfolds as a vivid sinister but incredibly hilarious universe populated with all manner of brilliant comedic creations what really sets the show apart from it is rivals is it is approach to telling us it is story rather than serve us rehashed sketches barely distinguishable from the next here we see each individual or group of characters go through their various journeys and story lines no visit to them is the same and each time they offer us up with a surprisegradually over three series and a christmas special the fictional town of royston vasey is heaving with a grotesque yet hilarious populace and that is probably the main reason why the show is such a joy to watch and also the reason why the show would easily merit more series unlike other current shows like the catherine tate show or more importantly little britain the league both know when a character has run it is course and have the opportunity to deal with that several fan favorites who could have easily been kept on to entertain further bowed out before the series came to a close giving room for fellow characters to grow more or allow for the introduction of newer residents of royston vasey to make their markanother thing that sets this show above others is that the writing team approach the script process with care and intelligence as mentioned before all four members of the league have a sound mind when it comes to judging the longevity of their creations and when it is time to call it quits in respect to certain characters this awareness has also meant the league of gentlemen undergoes a bold evolution not usually seen in a show of this nature the narrative driven and far darker third series is a brave step away from the more sketch based first two series and this bold move by the league really pays off with the third series there is less of an urgency for them to please an audience and like the christmas special they pursue individual stories with a clear narrative unlike the more sketchbased previous series that succesfully binded together various sets of sketches into a series long story arcthe third series is both a refreshing change of pace of style as well as a real treat for fans who have already seen the first two despite some polarized opinion on the third series any real fan of the league will appreciate what the third series has to offer as well as really enjoy the more character based episodes that only delve deeper into fan favorites but pair up and interwine characters that might not have crossed paths previouslyit might take a little trying to get into the change in style but it is definitely worth it and in my opinion the third series is the best and also provides a firm conclusion to the seriesthe shows not without it is drawbacks and very occasionally certain characters and set pieces appear somewhat out of place but for the most part the genius writing dark nature of the show and the host of brilliant characters that are often all too close to real life make for a real treat and prove what comedy should be about and puts much of the more recent catch phrase driven and often desperate attempts at comedy to shame,1
as other reviewers have noted the film dies in the last onetwo hour however before that it suffers from predictability and a stunningly vapid performance by kate capshaw who clearly never found her character and ruins every scene she is in connery is fine as is fishbourne but most scenes are manipulated for effect rather than truth which overlays the entirety with a sense of unreality and the ending is simply bizarre the film makers apparently knew when they pieced this mess together that all they needed were sweet potatoes and pumpkin pie to have thanksgiving dinner so to compensate they added an overloud dramatic score every little jump is accompanied by a crescendo of orchestration to the point where it becomes laughable if you want an example of major league bad film this is one to see otherwise skip it,0
ettore scola is one of the most important italian directors my parents and i watched together ceravamo tanto amati on a summer night we liked it but we did not love it as we loved a special day i believe ettore scola is pretty underrated we often forget to remember him maybe because his latest films were disappointing and so yesterday night my mum and i sat on our sofa to enjoy this masterpiece writing direction cinematography score and production design were sober and accurate but the thing i liked the most was the chemistry between loren and mastroianni they are both excellent actors and play the main roles of antonietta and gabriele antonietta is an housewife married with a fanatic fascist she has six children but her husband wants to have another child to get a prize for the huge families gabriele is simply an antifascist they spend together a special day that special day of one thousand nine hundred and thirtyeight when hitler came to rome visiting mussolini i do not want to spoil anymore about the plot go looking for this film,1
like the first touch of pleasure and guilt like a spontaneous youthful flirt of fascination and fear like a climax of contrary emotions said one of the movie buffs after viewing love at the top the misinterpreted title version of stylish director michel devilles le mouton enrage vincent canby in new york times however just after the one thousand nine hundred and seventyfour premiere of the movie stated love at the top which opened yesterday at the sixtyeightth street playhouse is a one thousand nine hundred and seventythree french comedy that dimly recalls a number of nineteenfifties english comedies about the rise and rise of cynical young men possessingand possessed byambition yet the significant difference that he mentioned was the fact that love at the top is not concerned with the english class systemjanuary twentyseven one thousand nine hundred and seventyfivehaving left the evaluations up to single individuals of course the test of time has done its just job what may be said with certainty after more than thirty years is that we can hardly find such movies like le mouton enrage where decadence appears innocent where liaisons appear youthfully enthusiastic where feelings occur so manipulative for romy schneiders fans it seems useless to point out that this film is a must see not only because she gives a unique performance as she did in all of her roles at the heyday of her career nine years before her sudden death but because she is particularly attractive here it is not trio infernal where the so to say forced escape from and the mockery of romys sweet image haunted for years by saccharine sissi meets its most discouraging manifestation but a film where the brilliant actress is given a fair role she plays roberte a woman who becomes the object of lust for the storys lead playboy nicolas mallet jean louis trintignant it is him who takes financial profits from lustful liaisons this movie can boast truly memorable and unique shots of romy and she is given some of her very best scenes romys sex appeal is unforgettable hereanother strong point of the film is its execution of the content with a development of individual perception immoral as it may seem the director makes a perfect use of contrast conventions vs pleasures innocence vs decadence genuine lust vs instrumental affair nicola owns most of the features that viewers may like or detest may find attractive or disgusting yet his are the features the viewers must treat seriously more to say they are the ones we all must accept that is why one is led to a peculiar gently wild erotically unique world of the main character although he sleeps with lots of women there are two women that represent a sort of contrary worlds for nicola roberte groult romy schneider and mariepaul jane birkin he manipulates them makes love to them cannot refrain from both desire for their bodies and desire for money yet he perceives them differently yet despite all of this adult maturity he is emotionally like a little boy who plays with a toycar on the table  a sort of detailed insight into male mind in a comedylike way of coursefinally there are very good performances which makes le mouton enrage slightly underrated not only the aforementioned romy schneider does a brilliant job supplying the viewers with an extraordinary insight into her role but young jane birkin appears to be convincing in the role of young inexperienced streetwalker marie paul jean louis trintignant makes it possible to see nicola in the right way this artistic merit lying in performances goes with terrific music by camille saintsaëns the tune that will ring in your ears for long therefore apart from some flaws of the movie like dated colors slow action sometimes possible clichés noticed by some viewers the merits should be found significant le mouton enrage in sum is a clear manifestation of contrary manipulative tools in life it is worth seeing as a moment in romys career a prelude to strong eroticism a chain of contrary emotions of love and hatred appreciation and disgust compared to the first orgasm and the first angasm but are not we humans viewers movie buffs built upon such contrasts,1
a somewhat dull made for tv movie which premiered on the tbs cable station antonio and janine run around chasing a killer computer virus andthat is about it for trivia buffs this will be noted as debuting the same weekend that the real life melissa virus also made it is debut in email inboxes across the world,0
some films are so bad that they are good this is clearly not one of them based on a true story this film was about as true to the story as pinocchios chances of becoming a real boy the acting was terrible the direction was poor and it travelled way too fast it was as if the director just wanted to get it over and done with and go homenor did melissa joan hart ever strike me as a talented actress but then every film she made was pretty lowbudget anyway like most of her other films she let us down her characters by hamming them up too much talking too quickly as if speeding up her words is going to make her more dramatic she really brings out the sense that there is a crew in front of her and she is talking to a camera when she should be engaging the viewer in her character it pretty much let us down the whole film and any leg that it may have had left to stand on is ruinedprobably the only good thing about the film is when she got nailed in the end but even that was not satisfying enough to subdue my loathing for such a bad filmwatch it if your taste in film is blander than a piece of dry toast,0
this is complete and absolute garbage a fine example of what a bad movie is like this cannot be appealing to anyone not even bmovie fans do not i repeat do not waste precious time of your life on this piece of trash bad acting bad directing horrible but i mean really horrible script and complete lack of an idea as to what entertainment of any form is i bought the dvd for three dollars i swear i could almost pay someone to take it burning it would not be enough for what this movie did to me i like bmovies the killer toys the weird lagoon monsters but this is nowhere near you know those movies that are so bad they are funny not even just plain old pathetic,0
caught this film in about one thousand nine hundred and ninety on video by chance and without knowing what i was in for many horror fans may have missed this thinking it was a typical prison film and the ones who did get it did not like it as it was not what they wanted to see the above mentioned factors are probably the reasons it is low rated but just ignore that and give it a whirl if you are a fan of the genreit has strong suits in all departments from script and atmosphere to acting and the prison itself an absolute diamond a film i still have on video to this day check it out,1
fiftytwopick up never got the respect it should have it works on many levels and has a complicated but followable plot the actors involved give some of their finest performances annmargret roy scheider and john glover are perfectly cast and provide deep character portrayals notable too are vanity who should have parlayed this into a serious acting career given the unexpected ability she shows and kelly preston who is character will haunt you for a few days anyone who likes action combined with a gritty complicated story will enjoy this,1
i was not sure at first if i was watching a documentary propaganda film or dramatic presentation i guess given the time of production it was a mix of all threeadmittedly the dramatic plot was somewhat predictable but you had a sense that there would be some interesting scenes as the movie went on we were able to witness what appeared to be realistic training regimens and equipmentwhere this movie came together for me was closer to the end the scenes had a realism at least as i perceived it that i have not encountered often before you could place yourself in the action and imagine the thoughts of the young combatants this was mixed in with the usual problems of portraying passable japanese soldiers at a time when you might think real japanese actors would be somewhat scarcethe movie is excellent as a source of the state of the american mindset in one thousand nine hundred and fortythree as the war waged with japan also of interest was a dig at the japanese with respect to the help the usa gave japan in past years,1
i am not usually one to slate a film  i try to see the good points and not focus on the bad ones but in this case there are almost no good points in my opinion if you are going to make something that bad why bother part of the film is take up with shots of annes face while she breaths deeply and violin music plays in the background the other part is filled with poor and wooden acting rupert penry jones is expressionless jennifer higham plays annes younger sister with modern mannerisms anne is portrayed as being meek and self effacing which is fine at the beginning but she stays the same all through the film and you see no reason for captain wentworth to fall in love with her overall the production lacks any sense of period with too many mistakes to be overlooked such as running out of the concert kissing in the street running about in the streets with no hat on why was this scene in the film at all the scene in the book was one of the most romantic scenes written to sum it up a terrible film very disappointing,0
full marks for pacinos rendering of the speech over the dead kids coffin shakespeares mark antony would be put to shamewas it paul schrader or was it ken lipper who should be complimented on the remarkable dialogues they are rich and intelligent and well worth your time if you like movies with good scripts i found the story narrative developing quite well right up to the voiceover postscriptthere is little else to talk about in this film even john cusack has done better roles than this one interestingly the film is very male orientedthe women are mere appendages,1
seven if you are a kid six if you claim to be an adult this semisequel to the lion king sees to spin off side characters timone and pumba retelling the original story through their eyes including the story of how they met in the grand tradition of disney inferior sequels are made and occasionally tv series featuring the adventures of minor characters from their biggest hits you can be as sceptical as you want about this but kids and fans of the series will likely not care their are enough jokes and songs and interesting things to ensure that this is one of the few above average sequels this works because of the charm of the muchloved central characters the quick pace the injokes involving the first film and for older viewers there are some funny gags the animation is as good as ever if a little less flamboyant than the original but the plot here is all about taking it easy hakuna matatatimone and pumba decide to watch the events of the first film frequently stopping midfilm to joke about parts of it like a real audience we see how timone is a near outcast he feels he does not fit in and decides to go looking beyond what he sees to find his ideal home on the way he meets pumba another outcast and they become friends soon they meet simba a lion cub natural predator of t and p but they form a trio however when simba realises he must follow his own destiny and leave the group it is up to the others to decide whether to help or not and how of course the usual disney elements and themes are here friendship good versus evil etc the plot is simple but works on many levels making it smarter than your average animated movie as the cg movies appear disneys traditional form must become smarter but not forget the roots which made them popular toy story and all that have come since have been clever with jokes to suit all ages and it seems this is the way the market is shifting however there will always be a place for films like this and you cannot go wrong buying this for the youngstersseven out of ten,1
the summer has been so full of blockbusters and comebacks of films and not to mention some of the disappointments of those comebacks that i was woe to find a film i could just sit down and enjoy in case you do not want to read further down the page there are not any spoilers i will sum it up here it is more mature than ella enchanted there are some questionably violent parts plenty of death and a handful of scenes with a little blood not for small children but does not try to be overly corny or overstep its bounds think of it as a bit more serious bit more magical princess bride and you will be close i am perhaps not as prodigious a movie goer as others maybe once or twice a month if i feel active i am also a huge scififantasy fan i get bored of remade repetitive story lines and films with more flash than filling faster than you can count to ten and this film is the diamond in the roughby the end here august i was tired enough of fractured expectations from the big hits that i averted seeing bourne ultimatum in favor of stardust having had my hopes thoroughly muddied by transformers for my fiction addiction the previews of stardust seemed appealing but i was certainly waryas many others here i was utterly surprised i had gone in thinking to see another generic fantasy movie clichéd from here to breakfast do not be fooled it is most definitely a fairytale and it does indeed have witches magic and utterly requires suspension of disbelief but the most refreshing thing i found is that it is not based on anything i have seen or read in the past fifteen years and it is actually a really good movieunlike ninety of the other movies which seem to persistently reappear like thorns in a side perhaps a sign that hollywood is running out of ideas i could read a book this year and in two years the movie would be out as another epic fantasy tale the likes of lotr and the rest so says the nyt and such and such no doubtstardust did not have me bolted to my seat because of jampacked action at every turn nor was i sweating bullets because of plothook after plothook threatening to tear the dramatic tension apart and echo throughout the theater in a loud boom it did not even use enormous blasts of sound to grab my attention to what is happening on screen transformers i am looking at you it is not trying to show off the latest cgi techniques nor did it offend my intelligence with dimwitted dialogs and story lines that are simple enough i could have figured them out in threerd grade boy i hate those i just watched watched and enjoyed a refreshingly creative storyline unfold before my eyes sure i may have known what was going to happen throughout most of the film but it makes you forget that it even made my heart twinge at some parts but the most important aspect i noticed is that i left the theater feeling better than when i would gone init truly is a gem after so much slush this summer with so many remakes and films that fell short of my expectations this was like a cold sweet cup of tea to cap off all the hard work i would done sitting through the others trying to come out of them with my moneys worthit is probably not for everyone but do yourself a favor if you enjoy fantasy films that stand the test of time alone princess bride black cauldron the dark crystal etc then you should really see this movie this little diamond is finding its way into my dvd collection the moment it hits stores you can trust me on thissimply wonderful,1
michael stearns plays mike a sexually frustrated individual with an interesting moral attitude towards sexuality he has no problem ogling naked dancers but when women start having sex with men that is when he loses it he believes that when women actually have sex that is when they lose any sense of innocence andor beauty so he strolls through the hollywood hills stalking lovemaking couples at a distance ultimately shooting the men dead with a highpowered rifle with a scopethe seeming primary reason for this movies existence is to indulge in sexual activity over and over again the story comes off as more of an afterthought this is bound to make many a happily heterosexual male quite pleased as we are treated to enough protracted scenes of nudity the ladies here look awfully good sans clothes and sex to serve as a major dose of titillation of course seeing a fair deal of it through a scope ups the creepiness factor considerably and illustrates the compulsion towards voyeurism for one thing mike eyes the couples through the scope for minutes at a time before finally pulling the trigger this is all underscored by awfully intrusive if somewhat atmospheric music on the soundtrackthose with a penchant for lurid trash are bound to enjoy this to one degree or another it even includes one lesbian tryst that confounds mike and renders him uncertain how to react it unfolds at a very slow pace but wraps up with a most amusing ironic twist it is a kinky and twisted rarity that if nothing else is going to definitely keep some viewers glued to the screenseventen,1
to summarize this movie without a real plot this movie consists of eighty minutes of deranged characters either drinking or making bad jokes the music is just awful the humor is not funny and all the female characters slutty idiots or total geeks it seems to me that the movie has actually been written by a fourteen year old boy who thinks that drinking is cool women are designed to please men and all that oppose that view are geeks also the movie has nothing to do with the original american pie movies other than a few names and mr levenstein who is a minor character in this one the only good thing about this movie are the nice looking girls do not watch this movie and do not be fooled by the fivefour rating because it obviously overrated and does not deserve anything above two,0
trailers of this movie may show scenes of violence or non mainstream sexuality but these scenes are just rare fragments picked out to attract audience they are of course showing the main message of the moviepeople who are constantly kicked on their heads in their jobs and lives using power which they may have somewhere else to notoriously oppress others and at the low end of the oppression chain mostly womena movie showing this as brutally as hundstage is surely tough to face but having to endure such lives is even toughertechnically the film is much like short cuts but consisting of documentary style episodes featuring people like your neighbour playing just the way they are without any glitter and most disturbingly without any hope its documentary style makes the movie even more disturbing because you realize such people are out there and there are many of them although our society focuses on the nice exterior looks somewhere the porn industry has to do its business somewhere unreported domestic violence has to take place somewhere hopes have to shatter i sure do know such peopleif you want to see a movie without any funny scenes some may think the handicapped woman repeating the top ten supermarkets is funny but this happens for real and without any melodramatic go watch this movie however it will lose when you are focusing on subtitles i fear as subtitles can´t transport accentuation,1
bogmeister and others have pretty much nailed this shore leave is really tos first attempt at lightweight scifi which they would later perfect with the classic trouble with tribbles it gave both the crew of the enterprise and its tv viewers a needed respite from the universe threatening consequences of for example the corbomite manoueverlooking for a place to chill out for a while the enterprise happens across a seemingly idyllic m class planet and sends an exploratory team down to take a closer look soon enough all kinds of absurdities begin to take place  some seemingly perilous  but it all seems a morass of human emotional extremities played out in a weird blend of fantastic mystery mccoy has gone through the looking glass psychological thriller kirk is stalked by an indefatigable bully from his past and romantic comedy no commenttos was the least serialized of all of the series in the trek franchise so it is easy to forget how many episodes in the first season focused on heavyhanded potentially calamitous drama unlike later series franchise writers tos production team was not afraid to literally go where no tv series had gone before and shore leave despite its occasional problems is an example my only criticism of this episode is that the cast particularly shatner  ironic given his legendary sense of humor did not seem to know how to handle this new wrinkle on sts themes the last scene is possibly one of the worst scenes i can remember from the entire tos run  both compositionally and in terms of actingnuff said my recommendation  see it while watching the entire first season as it was meant to be seen  it order,1
did heidijean really see this movie a great christmas movie not even close dull bland and completely lacking in imagination and heart i kept watching this movie wondering who the hell thought that carly pope could play the lead in this movie the woman has no detectable personality and gives a completely lackluster performance baransky was great as usual and provided the only modicum of interesting the whole thing probably her involvement was the only reason this project was green lighted to begin with maybe i am expecting too much for a lifetime movie played fifteen days from christmas but i sat through this thing thinking that with a different director and a recasting jj with an actress that at least could elicit sympathy this could have been quite a cute little movie,0
the film starts with a voice over telling the audience where they are and who the characters are and that is the moment i started to dislike the movie with all the endless possibilities any film director have in hand i really find it a very easy and cheap solution to express the situation with a voice over telling everything i actually believe voice overs are betrayals to the film making concepti hate to hear from a voice over saying where we are which date we are at and especially what the characters feel and think i believe that a director has to find a visual way to transmit the feelings and the thoughts of the characters to the audience but after the bad influencing intro a very striking movie begins and keeps going for a fairly long enough time the lives of a middle class family and all the members individually are depicted in a perfect realistic way i think the director has a talent for capturing real life situations for example a father who has to make his private calls from the bathroom might seem abnormal at first but life itself leads us some situations which might seem abnormal but also very normal as well i think the director is a very good observer about real lifebut that is it after a while the realism in the movie begins to sacrifice the storytelling i really felt like i am having a big headache because of the nonstop talking characters it was as if the actors and actresses were given the subject and were allowed to improvise the dialogs it is realistic really but characters always asking really is that so etc to each other or characters saying no or are you listening to me ten times when saying it only once is just enough causes me to have a headachei also think the play practicing and book reading scenes are more then they should be i understand that the play and the book in the movie are very much related to the plot but i think the director has missed the point where he should stop showing these scenes,0
i did not know it was possible to release a movie this bad the labeling sounded so promising but you would think that with a cast of twenty at least one of them would be able to act my wife left me and went to bed after the first twenty minutes she made a wise decision,0
the film is very complete in what it is keeping one continuously interested with the flashbacks to childhood and growing up with such a bizarre father and interspersing it with the tails of serial murder one simply cannot go wrong the very plot in itself the very story and essence of the film is entertaining it is the sort of story that the director bill paxton could do so much with and in this case he really did do a lot with itfrom beginning to end you are kept anticipating more and more about what is happening and where the film is going and the creativity that is behind this story is first class i felt as if this film was exquisitely done from start to finish and one of those rare gems that seemed to be without any boring lulls  the action flowing neatly quickly and tightly from one scene to the next it demonstrates just how far people can go so as to do such horrible things to their loved ones and to do such acts of evil in the name of god when they are disillusioned as in this case it also is sometimes interesting in its twists  takes on the concept of morality as a wholeoverall this is the sort of film that one easily overlooks but i would recommend you to not do likewise and to check this film out  it is very much so worth your time,1
i understand the jokes quite well they just are not good the show is horrible i understand it and that is another horrible thing about it the only cool character there ever was on the show was that one hobo in that one episode but then i see the other episode including that episode and the show is horrible it is not funny not funny i do not want people to say only smart people get it because if they are so smart why do they judge people they do not even know and say that they are not smart or intellectual enough to understand it it is like saying the sky is red but never looking outside but anyways this is absolutely the worst show i have ever seen in my life the jokes are terrible i mean you can understand them they are just horrible her controversy is very lame her fart jokes and other jokes on bodily fluids are really dumb and usually consist of really bad acting i am not sure what these smart people see in this show but judging others when they do not even know anything about any of us is not exactly a smart comment,0
there are too many new styles of the sitcom but the one that works best is the old fashioned way with an audience and indoor set that seventys show is a great example when the show came on the air nobody really heard of kurtwood smith and debra jo rupp much less the adolescents played wonderfully by topher grace and ashton kushton both of them are leaving the show this year to pursue other interests i wish topher would stay around because the show began about his character eric and his close circle of friends ashton is already the john travolta of our time remember when john was in love with diana hyland from eight is enough think of ashton with demi moore the cast of actors were never known to us which is a good thing because a celebrity cast member can spoil it i miss mo gaffney who played dons girlfriend joanne i miss lisa robin kelly as the original laurie the replacement could not match her and i am sorry about that i liked the casting of tommy chong as the wasted but beloved father figure to steven hyde i loved watching tanya roberts besides charlies angels i loved brooke shields playing jackies mom she really showed her acting talent before heading to broadway this show has been a delight with many surprises i hope this show lasts longer even though two of their cast members are leaving but i hope they do not stay too far away too long i wish the shows creators bonnie and terry turner who also created my other favorite show third rock from the sun is more successful on fox than they were on nbc which sabotaged their show the turners are not dummies and i hope they create more shows like this in the future,1
i would give it a twoteni was really really disappointedthe storyline was poorly developed for instance the incidents were too short and brief hence the moral was not clearly brought out i thought brenda song did a fine job but shin koyamada seemed to have a difficult time handling his role i could see the need to put in western elements in the show however there are certain parts where chinese elements were needed too the villain for example his physical appearance resembled a robot instead of something out of the chinese culture the final and the worst flaw were the incorrect and distorted facts placed in the showothers may point out that this is a kids show and hence there is no need for the such high standards however there are other disney shows such as mu lan which have been much better in terms of story development and presentationin conclusion i feel that disney movies should be better researched and better planned a good show is not enough with just a series of martial arts moves to depend on,0
anyone who finds this film boring is a hopeless bonehead who should stick to car chase movies and romantic comedies this film is riveting and does not have a boring moment why because it is comprised largely of intelligent dialogue between real people in a moment of crisis and details their efforts to survive that crisis i repeatintelligent dialogue that is what characterizes nearly all of rohmers films and that is why a lot of people do not like them they prefer action fine let them spend the rest of their lives watching action films while those of us with taste and discrimination will continue to seek out films like thisrohmer has always been accused of being talky well he is but to me that is a compliment not a criticism shakespeare was talky too is there a talkier play than hamlet whenever the subject or theme of a work of art consists of ideas and conflicts over values there must of necessity be a discussion of these ideas and values an that is largely what this film is all about aristocracy and noble birth vs egalitarianism loyalty to old friends that is put to the ultimate test when that friend takes what we believe to be a wrong path the value of human life and the responsibility to help save that life even if the person possessing that life is not so nice or even despicable anyone ever hear of dostoyevsky or crime and punishment these are what this film is all aboutthe two leads in this film are impeccable as if they were born to play these roles lucy russell who is english and speaks french as her second language is especially brilliant do yourself a favor and see this riveting film it may be the last film by this screen master,1
without wishing to be a killjoy brad sykes is responsible for at least two of the most dull and clichéd films i have ever seen  this being one of them and camp blood being another the acting is terrible the print is shoddy and everything about this film screams seriously you could do better yourself maybe this is a challenge to everyone to saturate youtube with our own zombie related crapi bought this for £one but remember you cannot put a price on seventyone minutes of your life you would do well to avoid this turkey even at a bargain basement price,0
you have heard it said to live every moment as if it is your last whether it is your last day or not i beg you not to waste any part of it watching this nichole hiltz provides some nice moments of eye candy that alas stays wrapped and david deluise shows why he should stick to the small screen or dog food commercials a shallow unrealistic plot with dreadful dialogue means there is no art in the art of revenge,0
i saw a special advance screening of this today i have to let you know i am not a huge fan of either dane cook or steve carell so i really had no expectations going into this i ended up enjoying it quite a bitdan in real life is the story of a widower with three daughters who goes to spend a weekend with his family while at a bookstore he meets the woman of his dreams only to find out that she happens to be his brothers girlfriendthis movie is pretty well made the soundtrack cinematography and acting are all topnotch especially steve carell my problem with it was mostly that there seemed to be a lack of character development mostly with dane cooks character we never really get a close look at the relationship between dane and steves characters and i felt that it could have helped a bit in showing what dans inner conflict about being in love with danes girlfriend was like other than this though dan in real life is definitely a solid sweet film definitely a nice break from all the horror and action movies we have been getting this year,1
there is one good thing in this movie lola glaudinis ass sorry to be so blunt but it is the truth too bad she did not do a nude it would at least have made this mess tolerable we see another chicks boobs but she is nowhere near lola and man is armand assante old or what the man looks like crap consequence is the usual bmovie you would expect the story had potential it is like they had good ideas but did not know how to execute them the cinematography is just plain awful ugly the directing is uninspired and the end result is a bland thriller with lame twists and washed up actors lola gaudini is great as the vixen in a cheap slutty way but not even she saves consequence from being trash and not funny trash just plain old stinking trash,0
i read the comment of chrismgrant from united stateshe wrote   a fantastic documentary of one thousand nine hundred and twentyfour this early twentyth century geography of todays iraq was powerfuli would like to thank chris and people who are interested in bakhtiari nomads of iran the zagros mountains and landscapes and have watched the movie grass a nations battle for life these traditions you saw in the movie have endured for centuries and will go on as long as life endures i am from this region of iran myself i am a bakhtiari chris i am sorry to bother you but bakhtiari region of zardkuh is in iran not in irak as you mentioned in your comment iran and irak are two different and distinct countries taking an iranian for an irankian is almost like taking an american for an mexican thanksziba,0
would someone tell shaq to stick to what he is good at basketball this movie was not even entertaining on a stupid level in this movie shaq plays a genie who lives in a boom box is that not orginal a genie in a boom box instead of a lamp he is supposed to help a little boy played by the equally annoying francais cappra this movie had the most flimsy storyline since water world the acting was awful and i think that anyone who likes this flim would be afraid to admit it,0
may and her husband go to visit their children and grandchildren the visit is awkward because the grandchildren and kids do not really seem to know each other as one might expect the warmth that should be there is missing after dinner mays husband says he does not feel well blames it on his daughters cooking and irritably says he wants to go home he dies that nightmay now a widow is lost she clearly did not have a passionate marriage or a very interesting one but she had a purpose she had someone who needed her and even though her own needs had gone unmet for years she had something to do with her daysshe is depressed and unmotivated she goes to stay with her daughter paula who shortly after her mothers arrival let us her mother know that she has never felt that her mother has given much of herself at all she let us loose with anger over her mothers lack of nurturing may seems disarmed and surprised yet she also does not seem to have the energy or the desire to really make it right i am your mother and i love you what does really say i have heard this from my own mother way too many times and have yet to figure out what it means paula is a bit well more than a bit neurotic both women are needy though they show it very differentlypaula has been involved with a friend of her sons darren who is a handyman working on the house owned by her son while paula is working during the day may begins to have conversations and lunches with darren darren is a married man who has stayed with his wife because of their autistic son nicky but supposedly does not live in the home with his wifemay becomes attracted to darren because he is virile and she enjoys the connection they seem to have darren becomes attracted to may because she offers a kind of peace and understanding that he does not get from the other women in his life he also becomes too interested in money that may says she can give him to get away from it all though he is clearly not interested in her desire to join him on such a journey they end up sleeping together in the spare room during the day and may enjoys fulfillment as a woman that she has not known in years nor had ever expected to know again as her daughter paula had often told her that she would leave the married darren this becomes part of mays rationalization that what she is doing is okayat a writing group that paula leads may is introduced rather forced to get together with a widower to whom she is not attracted there is one scene where she has sex with the older man who clearly can barely perform and it truly painful and unsettling as we see the total disgust on mays face as she endures the onetime ghastly liaisoneventually paula discovers through some very graphic sketches done by her mother that indeed her mother and darren have been having sexthis film will undoubtedly be seen by many in myriad ways sympathies will be divided at one point during paulas writing group may reveals through a short essay that she used to feel as though she hated her kids by the end of the day and would leave for pubs after they were asleep making sure to get back home before her husbandclearly a good mother does not think of leaving children alone while she goes off to the local pub may however also had revealed earlier in the film that her husband did not like her having any friends so she did not have any she did what he wanted her to do she was miserable but she put up with it because as she said it was easier so while may was not the best mother for those inclined to have any sympathy for her one might see mays actions as the act of a woman just wanting to be sexual and to be a live for a few minutes in her lifetime a woman who just wanted someone to listen to her to know her as a human being to have a friend and a loverpaula though neurotic and unhappy perhaps has become that way because of the distant parents who raised her certainly it is not difficult to understand why paula feels completely betrayed by her motherit is a welldone film with more complexities than i have mentioned and certainly one that will leave the viewer with many perhaps conflicting reactions it is a film worth discussing and debating and above all worth seeingone thing the film leaves us with is the horror and fear of a lonely life no matter who is deemed right or who is deemed wrong by each viewer that theme of old age and loneliness evoking a sense of dread in most of us is inescapable,1
i was not really fond of the first cube movie it was a good idea but the annoying acting and characters always kept me from liking it too much did not really feel the need to see its sequel but when i heard they were making a third movie that would act as more of a prequel to the original i was intrigued thinking that maybe they would fix some of the originals problems and provide us with a memorable cast of characters well i thought wrongcube zero starts well enough by introducing us with the two characters in charge of watching and maintaining the neverending maze of traps that plagues the people in the cube the filmmakers succeed in providing a sense of mystery with the establishment of the two mens daily routine several questions are created from it concerning the reason why people are send there and also the true nature of the ones who run the entire operation all of which are left entirely to the viewer the acting was a bit weak but all in all the movies first half moved relatively wellwith the story moving on one of the two watchers begins to develop serious doubts about what he is doing and later decides to go and help a group of the people trapped here is where everything rapidly starts to dissolve into dull cheesesent by the people who run the cube program we are introduced to the character jax along with his two underlings play a major reason as to why this movie is failure to start of jax looks and talks more like a third rate villain taken directly from a james bond movie complete with the ever popular glass eye that alone ruins any atmosphere created by the first halfs relatively nice pace what is more is that it begins to feel more like a comedy rather than a serious movie with some incredibly corny lines perhaps the screenwriter got bored and did not care the acting itself degrades to a further low when the former watcher meets the group in the cube the entire interaction is painful to watch as is everything else following itagain failing to impress on anything but weak characters dialog and acting cube zero is a waste of time for those searching for a good horror movie,0
i missed the beginning of this film which might account for why i disliked it so much on the other hand i have studied the fall of the roman republic for years so i know the story then again that might also be the reason why i disliked this filmthe film has more historical inaccuracies than extras though it is so inaccurate that i do not think they made an attempt for it to be correct in which case it can be forgiven the odd thing is that they sometimes go to great lengths to be historically accurate that it ends up getting confusing like throwing in antonius marriage to octavia and then pushing it aside two scenes later why even bring it up if it serves no purpose for the plot and octavia is never even seen and like calling antonius by his actual name marcus antonius in some scenes and by his strange english name mark antony in other scenesthough historical inaccuracies aside the film could still have been an entertaining watch if it was not for the leading lady there is not an ounce of dignity in her she is hysterical dramatical and completely lacking control of herself instead of being a clever and composed queen cleopatra turns into a hysterical teenager with a bad case of pms ninetyfive of that comes from the poor acting but five is also from poor script writing far too many stupid dramatic scenes are written into the script sometimes you were not watching antonius and cleopatra you were watching immature versions of dawson and joey from dawsons creekif you want to watch something about this period watch anything but this,0

ugly shot poorly scripted and amateurishly paced sequel to joe dantes one thousand nine hundred and eightyone classic the howling is one of the two or three only good werewolffilms ever made and yet it got rewarded by a series of obnoxious and unendurable sequels like this one if it is any consolation stirba is a sequel in name only and there is absolutely no connection with the characters or events that were introduced in dantes film the plot here revolves on a bloodthirsty cult of transsylvanian werewolves  primarily female ones  led by stirba stirba is played by sybil danning who transforms from a curvy old lady into a blond superbabe with impressive bosom in the blink of an eye and becomes all hairy when sexually aroused her archenemy is played by a seemly fatigue christopher lee his character  stefan crosscoe  is an occult investigator who travels to stirbas kingdom accompanied by an american couple who lost their friend to the werewolf cult in case you are exclusively looking for filthy gore and gratuitous nuditythis is your film even the smallest killing is shown in great detail and we are even treated to exploding eyeballs and the vile image of a dwarf who gets pierced on a pointy fence however if you want a little substance or depth you will be sorely disappointed the dialogues are embarrassing and there is absolutely no tension to detect anywhere the scriptwriters constantly seem to confuse werewolves with vampires the transsylvanian setting garlic wooden stakes and dannings gorgeous balcony is shamelessly exploited as the films only gimmick during the endcredits a shot in which she rips off her top is reedited repeatedly according to my fellow reviewer dr gore no less than seventeen times which is pretty pathetic and pointless the music is okay and some of the scenery is rather beautiful i am talking about the fiercelooking statues during the opening credits and the dark dungeons of stirbas castle the directing by philippe mora is a giant mess and  as far as i am concerned  his only worthwhile film remains the beast within released three years earlier,0
it is difficult to evaluate this or any other comparable film of the early sound era in terms that one might use for ordinary film commentary at times there is almost a desperation as many film personalities of the silent era try their wings at sound surely fearing that they will be left by the wayside as did happen to some rintintin however was pertfectly natural in such a vaudeville of unrelated sequences some were sure to stand out john barrymores soliloquy from richard ii is a moment certainly worth preserving by and large only those with earlier stage training exuded confidence however this is over all reasonably entertaining and a must for film buffs especially interested in the silent to sound transition,1
i actually intended to see this movie in the theatre it was actually sold out i actually went to see solaris instead which actually was the worst movie to be released in two thousand and twovictor rosa john leguizamo a tough streetwise street pharmacist freaks out when he sees a kid get shot so he decides to go clean and invest all of his money with jack peter sarsgaard things seem to be going pretty well until jack skips town with his girlfriend trish denise richards this happened very late in the movie so had they not revealed this in the preview it might have been an interesting twist but they did so it is notin fact there is not a single interesting thing about this movie everything is given away in the preview if you saw even one preview you saw the whole movie so you might just want to think really hard to fill in the gaps go to the website download the preview save yourself threeninetynine there is not a single surprise or twist in the entire film other than how terrible the soundtrack isi hope that whoever was in charge of writing the soundtrack was fired twice most of it is what music would be like if the only songs allowed to be released were ricky martin and gloria estefan duets and i may shatter the fabric of the spacetime continuum with a concept as mindnumbing as this they both had less talent and musical abilitythe acting is at best poor the script is at best a crime against humanity and denise richards is at best sixtyseven styrofoam and thirtythree ziploc bag you know things are bad when john leguizamo he was in the pest upstages the rest of the cast with his acting abilities,0
the cobweb is an example of many examples of movies that feature strong sometimes noteworthy performances and high points but unfortunately are shattered and slowed down drastically by a murky plot and very little to interest the audience it stars richard widmark as a doctor working at a mental institution whose life becomes in turmoil due to family problems and a rather ludicrous and overworked conflict that really seems like no big deal at allthe plot is preposterous its time for the institution to get new drapes for the library windows one old woman wants to have her drapes put over them but a lot of the patients want to make their own and somehow this ridiculous and unintentionally loony conflict breaks out into the point where lives are in danger and families start to fall apart it sounds more like a conflict that would occur between very young childrenthe questioning of the logic of the plot and whether it could really happen is so massive that one wonders if only a reallike lunatic could buy it do not get me wrong there is nothing wrong with the acting the cast following widmark is composed of other great actors many of them academy awardnominees and winners and there is occasionally a moment in the film that works out brilliantly but it always excludes the stupid plot about window drapes unfortunately there is too much about the doggone drapes and thus the movie slows down a lot of the takes are long and done from one camera viewpoint adhering to the slow pacing and lack of viewing interestin a short analysis the cobweb is an unrecognized film and it becomes obvious why to the viewers basically as soon as the plot comes into focus which it does pretty quickly it just really does not sound like much fun to watch and i tell you that it is not much fun to watch,0

the dentist starts on the morning of dr alan feinstone corbin bernsen  his wife brookes linda hoffman wedding anniversary on the surface mr  mrs feinstone seem to have a nice life a beautiful home in los angeles  he has a successful career with responsibility but beneath things are very wrong alan discovers that brooke is having an affair with matt michael stadvec the swimming pool cleaner to add to his humiliation alan then discovers that matt is also having sex with paula roberts lise simms one of his next door neighbours  to top it all off he owes the irs who are breathing down his neck a she would load of money alan starts to lose his mind he convinces himself that everything is decayed  rotten just like his patients teeth  it is up to him to fix it that morning at work he begins to take his frustrations  anger out on his patients first he injures a young boy named jody brian mclaughlin he sexual assaults a patient named april reign christa sauls after he hallucinates that she is his wife  deliberately performs an unnecessary  painful procedure on another alan also begins to take drugs as he completely loses it  goes homicidal starting with his adulterous wife  pool cleanerdirected by brian yuzna i thought the dentist was a good film  tried something a bit different the script by dennis paoli stuart gordon  charles finch is more of a psycho thriller than straight slasher which came as a surprise to me as i was expecting the latter it would have been easy to make a teenage slasher film like friday the thirteenth one thousand nine hundred and eighty with a high body count  a wise cracking dentist villain but what the dentist actually turned out to be is very different the dentist is at heart a character study of one mans descent into madness  it does a fine job although having said that i am not sure what he goes through is enough justification for his subsequent murderous actions it moves along at a nice pace has a nice narrative in which i liked the constant connection alan makes between the decay he sees in his patients  the decay he sees in the world around him  is an entertaining way to pass ninety odd minutes it goes without saying that anyone with a phobia about the dentist probably should give this one a miss or you will never go again i liked the ending too where the tables are turned i will say no moredirector yuzna does his usual fine job here in fact i do not think i have seen a yuzna film that i did not enjoy to some extent he obviously  predictably takes the opportunity to play on our fear of the dentist with some nice dental torture set pieces including pulling peoples teeth out sexually molesting them performing operations on drugs  torturing people with the dreaded dentists drill there are some other gore scenes as well a dead dog someone gorily slashed with a knife  cut out tongues yuzna gives the film a certain style on what was probably a low budget he likes to tilt his camera which make for some nice angles  i liked the shot where the camera is above someone being knifed  huge sprays of blood splatter on the floor in a nice wide overhead angletechnically the dentist is fine decent cinematography music  production values although some of the special makeup effects look a little unconvincing the acting is pretty strong from everyone involved with corbin putting in a good crackpot performance the ever cool  genre favourite ken foree turns up as detective gibbs one of los angeles finestthe dentist did not turn out like i had expected  all the better for it if your a horror fan  perhaps want something a bit different then this is well worth checking out i liked it  think it is definitely worth a watch,1
how the grinch stole christmas instantly stole my heart and became my favorite movie almost from my very first viewing now eight viewings later it still has the same impact on me as it did the first time i saw itscreenwriters jeffery price  peter s seaman of who framed roger rabbit fame do a fantastic job of adapting the story of the grinch to the screen ron howards direction brought the story to full life and jim carreys typically energetic performance as the grinch steals the showsome detractors of the film have claimed that it is not true to the spirit or principles of the original story having read the original story i must say i cannot agree the movie makes the very same point about christmas and its true meaning as the original story indeed it enhances the impact of the story by making it more personal by showing us how and why the grinch became what he wasmild spoilers they probably would not ruin the movie for you but if you have not seen it yet and you are one of those who wants to know nothing about a story until you have seen it you should skip the next two paragraphsi think just about everyone can relate to the grinchs terrible experiences in school i think all of us at one time or another were the unpopular one in school who was always picked on i know i was and that is why i personally had so much sympathy for the grinch and what he went throughand cindy lou who is naive idealism believing that nobody can be all bad was heart rending when everyone else had turned their backs on the grinch out of fear and ignorance cindy lou was determined to be his friend if only everyone could have such an attitudein fact i think the only thing that might have made the film a little better would have been to further tone down the adult humor and content it was already pretty restrained but any of this adult humor like when the grinch slammed nose first into martha may whoviers cleavage just does not fit in a story like thisthis ones well on its way to being a christmas classic taking a richly deserved place alongside the book and the chuck jones cartoon as a mustsee of every christmas season,1
i would like to comment the series as a great effort the story line although requiring a few improvements was pretty well especially in season one season two however became more of a freak show and lost das original charm season one story line was more interesting a light side to the life at jam pony while a focused serious plot with manticore chasing down the xseries i was looking forward to new seasons in fact i still am i hope the fox guys and da production crew realize that a lot of people still wait for da to make a comeback even after two yrs of it being cancelled da can make it big if worked on properly and i think a name like james cameron should take on this challenge,1
collusion course is even worse than the typical evil white male corporate capitalist movie of the week this movie is less pleasant than a toothache jay leno can act he is good in his underrated debut movie the silverbears in which he gives a performance consist with the demands of his character this movie is so bad lenos character a sanctimonious buffoon is less annoying than moritas character a sanctimonious fool,0
a chemist develops a fabric that never gets dirty or wears out but it is seen as a threat to the survival of various industries in this delightful ealing studios comedy guinness is marvelous as the mildmannered but persistent chemist greenwood with her sensual voice plays the love interest parker is her harried father thesiger is amusing as a patriarch of the fabric industry while telling an engaging story the film also raises some intriguing questions about science the economy and politics it is adeptly directed by mackendrick who would go on to make the ladykillers and the sublime sweet smell of success later in the one thousand nine hundred and fiftys,1
how low can someone sink while trying to recapture an old glory sthf will be glad to show youif you are used to seeing what made for a good star trek show do not watch thisthe writing is hodgepodge the actors portrayals of their characters weak and most of all the design work is downright doggylike watching strong captains do not look here like the strong federation attitude forget about it here starfleet is mocked by ensigns wearing spikes in their hairwhile a seemingly mentally feeble captain shuffles about and within two minutes of the opening shows credits ensign spikey is attempting to arrange a tryst with an engineer it just degrades from there no not even uniforms match for goodness sake they are too small or too big collars down to their chests and tng seasons one and two uniforms mixed in with season three and dsnine uniforms the strict discipline and tradition of any of the originals in lacking in this production down to the treads the only good thing about this show is its graphics which seem to improve a bit with each season ok i take that back who uses cg that inexpertly the designers of this showdo not bother with it it will offend your star trek sense as it did mine not even the throw backs to previous shows can save this catastrophei wept openly when i watched this probably because my eyes were bleeding and my head almost ruptured that bad,0
if todd sheets were to come out and admit that this movie was intended to spoof the zombie genre i would change my rating to an eight try to imagine a movie where every scene line and even every acting nuance was designed to be a parody i could probably crap out alphabet soup rearrange what was left of the letters and still have a better script two scenes in particular come to mind when i think of this movie spoiler alert one is when mikes dad and the other dad walk i repeat walk down a staircase jam packed with zombies this is a small staircase and even though they brush up against the flailing undead nothing happens to them when they reach the end the exmarine turns around says god you are a horny bastard and shoots only one the other is in the military complex the girl stabs a zombie with a machete and is immediately surrounded the camera moves around her for roughly forty seconds while she is surrounded by zombies at an arms length away she then almost casually runs out from the crowd and joins the other humans spoiler alert over these scenes must be seen to be believed still i enjoy this movie as much as almost any comedy just because it is so damn funny kudos to todd sheets for getting so many people in his movie and having the drive to make it but not really for anything else,0

a disappointing filmthe story established our protagonist as chrissy a young rather sullen individual drifting not doing much actually she does very little to move the narrative along so it did not surprise me to see the focus shifting on her relatives it is a pity though chrissy seem like interesting characterstory was predictable and at times felt quite formulated so the question now is when are we going to see the campions jacksons and the tamahoris breaking ground with compelling cinematicallytold stories that will inspire rather than entertain for the toll of two hourstechnically a disgusting shot film,0

i have not seen the first film and if it anything like this have no great desire to having just watched it a few hours ago i am struggling to remember a thing about it from what i remember it is main plot seems to be a group of very annoying people stay at a house with that dodgy old woman from friday the thirteenth and are stalked by plank of wood mansome people die the film ends i am starting a law suit against the person who sold me this film as i want compensation for the missing time in my life i will pay you £one to take this film off my handsoh wait i already gave it away to a friend,0
and even then even they can live without seeing it to be honest this film if one deigns to call it that is of real interest only to bondage freaks bettie page fans will learn absolutely nothing new and i do mean nothing nor will they enjoy the warm fuzzies of experiencing anything familiar loved or cherishednevermind the abysmal screenplay the wooden lessthancommunitytheater acting the utter absence of direction the crappy lighting or any of the rest of the bargain basement production values this is definitely hey kids let us make a movie moviemaking of the lowest order i suppose one could be thankful that at least they knew how to run the camera no i am sorry to say that none of that is germane to why this thing is so outright wrongit is wrong because the young lady playing bettie page a somewhat zaftig girl whose only resemblance to the queen of curves is dark hair and the trademark bangs utterly fails to bring anything to the role beyond a willingness to be bound and gagged this is apparently a good thing for her film career before and since this wretched excess but not for the wretched excess itself which consists primarily of a number of lovingly reenacted bd setpieces sandwiched between horrendously awful fauxbiographical scenes delineating ms pages fall from grace so to speak there is actually probably more information per se about pages life in the opening and closing credits than the rest of the moviedo not be fooled this is not a worthy companion film to the notorious bettie page this is not a worthy film at all this is a fetish piece that trades on the allure of one of the greatest pinups of all time and does it without class without style and without any real sense of understanding the character of bettie page whatsoever no true bettie page fan will find it to be anything but a disappointment i guarantee thatavoid at all costs if free remember that time is money too yours may not be worth much but i am betting it is worth enough that you will be sorry you wasted time with this one that is it i am done you have been warned,0

this is a classic example of an increasing problem with films why is the background noise and the soundtrack dramatically louder than the dialogue what sense does that make this film is not alone most films seem to do this now for two years i wondered if it was just something wrong with my tv but then i got a new tv  there it is again background noise that could be taking place a city block behind the actors drowns out the dialogueit was even more distracting in this film because in the english version anyway the woman mumbles constantly i kept hoping jean reno would say excuse me would you speak up or get the marbles out of your mouth if you watch it on dvd  you have even highschool french i recommend the french version with subtitlesi give it four because reno was so good in leon people rave about the scenery but i saw it on a tv  i lived in the rockies for a few years so enh,0

first let me say i am not from the south but i am an american i do not love country music but i can stomach it i would never wear a cowboy hat but i wear hats i do not live in a trailer but i do eat tuna salad and own a home what does that have to do with this comment a lot if you are one of those people who say only country people love this movie this movie is loosely based on the they loved and lost premise james bridges directs an american love story as real as it gets in an era of jerry springer and let us put it out there mentality this film rings truer than ever bud is coming of age and embarks on a life of his own with a little help from his aunt and uncle so he moves to the big city with them bud finds himself drawn into the local honky tonk world for the only escape a blue collar man can afford he quickly meets sissy who is from a similar background and the two have a whirlwind romance filled with painful ups and downs this plot takes so many turns that one has to just sit for a few minutes before they get hooked marriage is a focus here that is often missed early in the film they marry and we view the transition from being single to married the film highlights some of the modern struggles a woman has when she marries an old fashioned man it also brings into view the male ego with women and competitionbud is challenged and is excited when mickys puts in an electronic bull sissy gets ideas of having fun on it too but is quickly reminded that she is married and need to start acting like it the emotion between the two characters is raw and expressive and the plot continues from there especially when they note this is giving some of the storyline away split and sissy falls for an ex con with a penchant for abuse and cruelty she soon realizes that the grass is not always greener on the other sidehow anyone can compare bud to vinnie barbirino is shocking to me john travolta gave an exceptional performance that was worthy recognition he was believable and real the scene where he shaves his beard and you first see him at the barstill gives me goosebumps mind you i am not a huge travolta fan but come on i see why sissy was kicking of her boots so early in the film deb winger was so real that you found yourself sympathizing with her as she pens a note of emotions to bud after sneaking in to clean his house during their break up the supporting cast was incredible wes played by scott glenn gave a first rate performance that made you hate him and curse him as he abused sissy madolyn smithosborne as buds mistressgirlfriend was so authentic that large chested girls across the yous prayed to wake up flat chested to wear the clothes she donned in the film my biggest kudoss go to barry corbin and brooke anderson as buds aunt and uncle they seemed like someone is aunt and uncle somewhere in texas and however small their role they made the film so much bigger and lifelike two memorable scenes were the dolly parton contest and the unforgettable scene where bud and his aunt stand outside after one of the characters death the dialog between them is touchingif you can watch this for what it is a true american love story then i recommend that you take it for what it isa film before it is time that gave us voyeurism into a world unlike our own but real enough for our enjoyment and entertainment if this world sounds similar to yours then you will enjoy it so much more lastly the music however dated is sure to send you back in time if you are over thirty years of age,1
satans little helper is one of the better b horror movies i have seen when i say better i mean the story the film hatches a new plot something that is not so cliché in the horror genre  something fresh but there are also some ridiculous questions that come along with it questions you will be asking yourself throughout the moviethe film first caught my attention while i was cruising the horror section in hmv i was tired of all the so called terrifiying hollywood blockbusters and wanted something different the cover art for satans little helper immediately caught my attention as you can see the image draws you in  it is chilling i knew it was a straight to dvd release  but i took a chance i mean i just seen boogey man the night before  so it could not get any worse after i watched the movie i was semisatisfied i loved the plot of the movie it was really creepy how the killer was pretending to be the little boys friend so he could kill in some sick deranged way he actually thought he and the little boy would become partners  a duo of terror it was a great idea to set the film on halloween night this way no one would think anything of a masked man beside a little kid they would simply think he was his guardian but this is also where the plot holes begin to surfaceif your son came home with a friend he met trick or treating  that is fine you would not think anything of it  if he was nine or round about the same age as him if however he appeared with a strange man in a mask you would be startled and protective of your child you would ask the man to remove his mask and identify himself you would ask why he is with your son he does not know him you would tell him to please leave he is not a family friend he is a stranger now we are supposed to teach our child not to talk to strangers in this case the mum is completely fine with it huh they never seem to think it is a tad odd that the man does not speak  at all gruanted they think it is the daughters boyfriend but after ten minutes of not talking you would pull the mask off and ask him why he is not saying a wordthe film goes down hill from there the thing that got me the most was all the mum said was do you want some cider i cannot count how many times she says this in the movie it is like oh you are dying  we have cider though it is all good the movie started promising and failed to deliver it was more of a horrorcomedy and even as that it fails to deliver i guess you could call it a dudflop etcthe best thing about the movie is the cover art though something tells me that is not worth the twelve dollars,0
branagh is one of the few who understands the difference between a film and a play hamlet is probably the most faithful adaptation of shakespeare to a film and yet is a very dynamic film almost an action thriller the scene of hamlets meeting with his fathers ghost will not leave your mind,1
xizao is a rare little movie it is simple and undemanding and at the same time so rewarding in emotion and joy the story is simple and the theme of old and new clashing is wonderfully introduced in the first scenes this theme is the essence of the movie but it would have fallen flat if it was not for the magnificent characters and the actors portraying themthe aging patriarch master liu is a relic of chinas preexpansion days he runs a bath house in an old neighbourhood every single scene set in the bath house is a source of jelaousy for us stressed out unhappy people not even hardened cynics can find any flaws in this wonderful settingmaster lius mentally handicapped son er ming is the second truly powerful character in the movie coupled with his modernlife brother the interactions between these three people and the various visitors to the bath house are amazingly detailed and heartfelt with some scenes packing so much emotion it is beyond almost everything seen in movieswith its regimecritical message this movie was not only censored but also given unreasonably small coverage it could be a coincidence but when a movie of this caliber is virtually impossible to find even on the internet you cannot help getting suspiciousso help free speech and the movie world buy rent copy this wonderful movie and if you happen to own the dvd if there even is one then share share share,1
this is the crappiest film i have ever seen but in all fairness it is watchable and rather funny i do not think the filmmakers intended it to be your typical hollywood blockbuster quality it is just a stupid film about a serial killer who gets doused in a load of toxic waste causing a reaction with him and the snow as it is the middle of winter he then turns into a killer snowman which is enough to to make you laugh on it is own this film is really stupid but it is funny the killings are hilariousi would not advise you to go and buy it like i did the cover looked goodbut if it happens to be on tv one night and you are up for a laugh then stick it on,0
lol not a bad way to start it i thought this was original but then i discovered it was a clone of the one thousand nine hundred and seventysix remake of king kong i never saw king kong until i was fifteen i saw this film when i was nine the films funky disco music will get stuck in your head not to mention the films theme song by the yetians this is the worst creature effects i have ever seen at the same time this film remains a holy grail of bmovies memorable quotes take a tranquilizer and go to bed put the yeti in your tank and you have yeti power i remember seeing this film on movie macrabe hosted by elvira there is one scene where it was like king kong in reverse in king kong he grabs the girl and climbs up the building but in this film he climbs down the building and grabs the girl who was falling also around that year was another kong clone mighty peking man one thousand nine hundred and seventyseven which came from hong kong there is a lot of traveling matte scenes and motorized body parts this film will leave you laughing it is like i said just another king kong clone rated pg for violence language thematic elements and some scary scenes,0
first i want to clarify that the average users inability to appreciate imagination is appalling what makes this show so unique is the hyperreality it creates you do not need to know why ned can bring people back from the dead or why it can only be for a minute where has the wonderment of childhood whimsical tales gone much like a wrinkle in timei say it is refreshingly original because it is a polar opposite to the masses of layitallout television that leaves no room for imagination or wonderit is nice to add a bit of escapism to the television experiencethe hyperreality is my favorite aspect of the show the one thousand nine hundred and fiftysesque setting the innocent and rare characters and the scenery and physical setting which are not meant to be taken as pure realitythis show masks the morbid nature of death while others embrace it while entertaining other television shows have taken a back shelf to this series it truly has restored a sense of curiosity imagination and wonder to televisionpushing daisies quickly made it to the top of my list,1
i saw this movie years ago and i was impressed but then again i was only twelve years old i recently rewatched it and want that time back this film is pretty bad while i like lee majors chris makepeace watch my bodyguard one thousand nine hundred and eightyif you would like to see a good movie that he was in of meatballs also starring bill murray for some laughs and burgess meredith this role doesdid nothing for their careersanyway lee majors character franklyn hart is an ex race car driver who plans on driving his race car which he had in storage across the country to california one problem the government has outlawed all private transportation i thought the concept was ok not the worse i have heard of but the execution failed horribly,0
this movie is a great example of how even some very funny jokes can go terribly wrong i really expected at least something from this movie after seeing the add which was funny as hell but the movie was not half as goodthe weird part is that the jokes are actually funny the spoofs of the smoking ban jo bole etc are genuinely good jokes but i do not know whom to blame this movie flop onthe prime candidates may be one the hammers  actors and hammeresses actresses and not even the funny kind two the director threethe guy who cast the actors andor the director anyway if you are really really bored and i mean really see this movie or else get a copy of each and every ad or teaser of this movie and laugh your butt of because those will be far funnier than the filmps the only saving grace of this film is mahesh manjrekar and the funny chappu bhai,0
a truly unpleasant film while rick bakers special effects are quite impressive if stomachturning it has no other redeeming features like many seventys movies it leaves you feeling as if you need to take a long shower and scrub the slime off of yourself the characters are uniformly unpleasant and plot makes no sense,0

there was not one original idea in this story themes were pulled from various sources a few being the ninth gate in the mouth of madness another carpenter film and the ring it even went as far as featuring the same damn glowing circle from the ring and using it as the films namesake the soundtrack by cody carpenter was all but lifted from suspiria hopefully no one will oppose this comment by spewing the word homage around yes i saw that the theater was playing argentos deep red claiming an homage would be a bullshit copout this was bottomofthebarrel throwing gore and disturbing imagery into the pot does not make a good horror film carpenter used to know that he should fade into obscurity or acquire a time machine,0
i caught this at a screening at the sundance film festival and was in awe over the absolute power this film has it is an examination of the psychological effects on our brave soldiers who join the military with hopes that they will protect and serve our country with honor as well as be taken care of by our government for it the film details the psychological changes that takes place in boot camp as the soldiers are turned into killers for their country and put into the war and the after effects once they return home it also portrays the effect that killing has on the human psyche it pays homage to the soldiers and never ever criticizes the soldiers unlike other films instead criticizes a system that is not prepared to and does not take care of all the physical and psychological needs of the returned vetsthis film is powerful moving emotional and thought provoking it stands as a call to arms to support our troops not only by buying stickers and going to parades but by actually listening to them and helping to support a change in the way their health and well being is taken care of after the killing endsthe best film of the festival so far ,1
there was a stylish approach to this film on the part of director vincenzo natali with interesting camera angles and effective closeups it was also refreshing to see jeremy northam and lucy liu given leading roles and expanding their range as performers this film also included one of the most imaginative escape scenes in recent years the efforts of the director and the actors combined in an effective thrilleralthough the plotting of the film was convoluted the story progressed very clearly as the layers of corporate greed and skullduggery were revealedin one thousand nine hundred and fortynine george orwell suggested in his famous novel one thousand nine hundred and eightyfour that the future would be ruled by the totalitarian state which would control minds and diminish human liberty it was interesting that in this intriguing futuristic film it was not the state but rather the corporate world that controlled and devalued the human worker,1
i really think i should make my case and have everyhorror and or cultmoviebuff go and see this moviei diditisexcellent very atmospheric and unsettling and scaryincridible how they could make such a gem of a film with the very lowreadnobudget they hadsynopsis taken from website one morning an old man wanders out into the woods in search of his runaway cat he finds instead a child without parents and a murder with no corpseon this websiteimdb there is no trailer but i will leave a link here to the site of the movie itself where there is a trailer which is quite unsettling so please go and check it out,1
i actually did not mind the geico commercials the first fifty of so times i saw them and even found them to be a bit wry and amusing but seriously this is the best thing that these people could come up with this show sucks it is bland and feels like watching an episode of the office with the characters disguised as cavemen i know a lot of you will hate me for saying that but the office just does not do it for me okay i get it we have the poor slob just trying to keep his nose clean and he has a crappy boss who hates him the pseudointellectual who really just has a barelyfunctioning intellect and the dopey one who just wants to be accepted but so what i have worked with these people and found them just as annoying in real life as i do on tvwhy would i want to waste another onethree hundred and thirtysixth of my week watching more of those type nominates please call your parents and ask them if they dropped you on your head if after thinking about it you still delude yourself into believing that this is entertainment,0
i noticed at once that this movie really was not based on dodie smiths novel in any case it was a nice idea that pongo and perditas son now had his own puppies the cutest of the dalmatians was of course little snowball who was completely spotless till the very end of the film to be honest i did not know what to think when cruella de vil seemed to have changed completely kind in fact i have often thought about the possibility that she could become friendly but now that she so quickly changed into herself again and announced that she was cruella once more i almost began to be really worried about chloes dalmatiansactually the scene in which the puppies watched lady and the tramp while chloe and kevin had their dinner was much better than i had expected i also was fond of the parrot who played to be a dog and it was incredible that the dogs had learned so many tricks for this movie of course i was content that at the end the dalmatians were saved again but i would have liked to know what was going to happen to cruella after she had lost her whole property and what on earth could the dogs home do with such a huge sum of moneyfinally it was quite touching that snowball also had spots at the very end of the film,1
yes i will say before i start commenting this movie is incredibly underratedsharon stone is great in her role of catherine trammell as is morrissey as dr glass he is an analyst sent in to evaluate her after the death of a sports star glass is drawn into a seductive game that trammel uses to manipulate his mindthe acting was good apart from thewlisstone really has a talent with this role she is slick naughty and seductive and does not look a day older than she did in the firstshe really impressed melike in casino morrisey was also good he showed much vunerablitity in a role that needed it thewlis however was lame he ruined his character and was overthetop the whole way he really suckedoverall this movie not as good the first but stone is a hoot to watch just ignore thewlis,1
first of all the big named actors must need the money the surgical scenes were laughable and surely they must know that people who have a little knowledge of medicine would find this utterly absurdanesthesiologists do not leave the room during a heart transplantnor do they do the surgery in a tiny room devoid of instruments heart lung equipment and sterile techniques just a joke could not concentrate on the story line because of all the stupid surgery scenes no blood no personnel and then the hero doc coming in and taking over it is not a film for thinking adultsalso the budget must have been limited the street scenes were ok but who was the technical adviserseems like it was directed by a total idiot save your money and wait until it comes out on dvd and do not rent it,0
halloween is the story of a boy who was misunderstood as a child he takes out his problems on his older sister whom he murders at the beginning of the film this is just the start of things to come from michael myersdonald pleasance plays the doctor who is been studying myers for years he knows that something is different about him something mysteriously evil this evil will not be contained and it cannot be stoppedafter an escape from an institution myers tracks down his younger sister if he kills her there may be an end to the troubles of this misunderstood boy but he seems to have problems in finishing his sister off as other people get in the way he manages to take them out while still looking for that one girl he needsthere have been a lot of those horror movies involving teenagers getting hacked to pieces by a masked or gruesome killer but this one started it all sort of if you think about it most of those horror movies we all remember are the ones that have freddy kruger or jason chasing around half naked girls well if it was not for halloween those characters would not have haunted our dreams when we were childrenhalloweens director john carpenter got a lot out of the horror movies of the fiftys and combined everything he knew into one film that scared the hell out of a lot of people back in the late seventys this films solidified him as a director to watch and also jump started the career of jamie lee curtis who plays the girl being stalked by the masked killerthis film may seem cliché today but back then there was not much out there like this it is been copied from and ripped off of but halloween will always remain the quintessential teenage horror movie it still gives you chills listening to carpenters thrilling music while we see another victim get chased by that shadowy michael myers,1
for anyone who has seen and fallen in love with the stage musical a chorus line the movie is a shoddy substitute not only are songs cut but unnecessary plot twists added new dance sequences choreographed and let us face it richard attenborough just does not know how to film dancersonstage michael bennetts a chorus line was just that michael bennett his idea his choreography his direction his gift to broadway and the rest of the world it was two hours of hardhitting inyourface realism that really made you feel for these boys and girls the movie however lacks empathy and depth the actors look like they are auditioning for a chorus line rather than actually auditioning every move every line of dialogue seems so weighted and planned michael douglas especially as zach is too in control for us to believe that he is this extraordinarily bitchy choreographer even when he throws his temper tantrums you never quite believe him because every gesture every accented word every nuance is so obviously rehearsed and as for him not dancing kevin kline auditioned for the role of zach on broadway michael bennett loved his reading but kline could not dance and ultimately lost the part how i wish they had done the same for douglas a chorus line is supposed to be a show about nobodies and aside from a few recognizable faces vicki frederick who played cassie on broadway as sheila and khandi alexander of tvs newsradio as one of the many auditioning dancers you are not supposed to know any of these people because you do know these people having a star in any of the roles is a terrible decision when you focus on michael douglas and his ranting instead of on the girls and boys on the line and their stories you lose somethingit is truly unfortunate that the best sequence in the show montage hello twelve hello thirteen hello love is cut drastically to make way for a terrible new song entitled surprise surprise that surprisingly received a nomination at the oscars cassies mirror dance has a new song and tragically boring choreography  one wonders why they bothered to shoot a movie version at all if they were going to mess with a working formula this muchfor fans of musical theatre and those who enjoyed the stage version this movie is a sad mockery of everything they cherished and loved for those who never got to see the original production either on broadway or on tour this movie is the only reference they will have to go by and they will have to wonder just how it got to be the longestrunning musical in broadway history  until a little show called cats overtook it in the late one thousand nine hundred and ninetys but that is a different story and do not even get me started there,0
i own this movie not by choice i do i was really bored the other day and the box intrigued me so i popped it in the old vcr and spent the next hour and a half of my life crying why god why the storyline was not that bad as an gamer i could appreciate bits of it i think that maybe if you are into super geekycheese romantic scenes you will enjoy this film i always thought of myself as a vulcan you know like drspockunable to love there is very few good things to say about this film truly it is awful but if you are up to really badly made film this is the one for you the real storys much more interesting though if i had to sum up this film in one word it would belame,0
i fell in love with this silent action drama kurt russell and only kurt russell could have played this so well raised from childhood to know nothing but war and fighting todd kurt russell is dumped on a planet after being made obsolete by genetically engineered soldiersthe stage is set and another classic icon of action movies was born  soldier not rambo not schwarzenegger not bruce willis not mel gibson not jason statham  kurt russell owns this role and made it entirely his  original daring and all too human i miss the fact that sequels were never madetentenldmy faith ,1
i watched this film not really expecting much i got it in a pack of five films all of which were pretty terrible in their own way for under a fiver so what could i expect and you know what i was right they were all terrible this movie has a few and a few is stretching it interesting points the occasional camcorder view is a nice touch the drummer is very like a drummer ie damned annoying and well that is about it actually the problem is that its just so boring in what i can only assume was an attempt to build tension a whole lot of nothing happens and when it does its utterly tedious i had my thumb on the fast forward button ready to press for most of the movie but gave it a go and seriously is the lead singer of the band that great looking coz they do not half mention how beautiful he is a hell of a lot i thought he looked a bit like a meercat all this and i have not even mentioned the killer i am not even going to go into it its just not worth explaining anyway as far as i am concerned star and london are just about the only reason to watch this and with the exception of london who was actually quite funny it was not because of their acting talent i have certainly seen a lot worse but i have also seen a lot better best avoid unless your bored of watching paint dry,0
i sought out this film for one reasonal adamson he is among the worst directors of all timeright up there with ed wood jr and ray dennis steckler and the pantheon of awfulness however i was a tad disappointed because although the film was indeed bad it never approached the levels of awfulness of some of his earlier schlocky movies because of that this film was not particularly fun to watch for us bad movie fansnow i was wary about watching this film as the title naughty stewardesses makes the film sound like a pornographic filmsomething i would not be reviewing on imdb however this film appeared to be this at timesparticularly the first ten minutes but you could tell that the script underwent many changes as for much of the film there is not any titillation at all and towards the end of the movie there is a plot that comes out of no where that is violent and certainly not sexy the result of all this is total confusionsadly none of the many parts are even good for example as a porn video it shows surprisingly little and it is incomprehensible why they would put a seventyone yearold guy in some of the love scenes sure for a seventyone yearold mr livingston looked pretty goodbut he was still an old man and no one would want to see him getting it on with young nymphet then when the final twenty minutes becomes very violent as livingston became a rambolike guy talk about weird and inappropriateoverall there is little to recommend this sad movie it is not bad enough or sexy enough to care about and the film manages to be rather boring even with such a crazy title like naughty stewardesses,0
this independent film was one of the best films at the tall grass film festival that i have ever seen there i loved it there are so many things that was great about the film on top of all that the cast and crew that i had the opportunity to meet were absolutely phenomenali thought that avi did a great job in his role and ricky ullman was absolutely true to his role for a disney actor i was amazed at his talent to be able to go from cheesy teen comedy to such an adult role with no problems the talent in the film was just amazing the cinematography was just great if you want to see an independent film this is one really that you should seei think that mr gruver would have been so proud to have such a submission in his festival and his parents loved the movie so much when it won the audience favorite they went and saw it again this truly was a great film it was dark and funny and sad and truly emotional it was just fabulous i am honestly just so enthused by this film and i really do not want to spoil it for any one just see it and truly be amazed at it i think that these film makers really have what it takes to go places and i hope to see more work from them in the future,1
enormous fun for both adults and children this film works on numerous levels there is everything from car crashes and cake in the face to some very good yet subtle jokes for adultsglenn close is at her sublimely evil best as cruella call me ella de villeafter three years in dr pavlovs behaviour modification clinic she is cured of her desire for fur  even the puppyskin fur she had so intensely desired she even has all of her fur coats placed in the dungeon of the extraordinary castle she inhabitsbut it would not be a dalmatian movie without the subterfuge and machinations of cruella and you know that something will change her behaviour modification and now she needs one extra puppy hence one hundred and two dalmatians to complete her nefarious scheme this time roundioan gruffudd is instantly appealing as the hero of the film that runs the second chance dog shelter though he was in titanic and in last years television version as pip of great expectations i did not recognize him well he was fifth officer lowe in titanic and i did not see great expectations so i am not terribly surprisedgerard depardieu does a delightful turn as the furrierpawn of cruella he prances and postures in the most outlandish and outrageous of fur clothing you have ever seen  and does it well his wicked witch of the west homage is hilarioustim mcinnerny is superb is cruellas notsoevil henchman  he was also alonzo cruellas butler in one hundred and one dalmatians and you may also recognize him from all of the black adder britcoms he plays his usual bumbling goodhearted somewhat dimwitted character to great effectoscars for costuming are generally given for the entirety of the costuming in a film this is unfortunate as the clothing worn by glenn close is amazing  it is incredibly detailed note her handcuffs when she is being released from the behaviour modification clinic and worthy of such an overthetop character her clothing alone deserves at least an oscar nominationanimation holds a special place in my heart  but comparing this film to the original animated film is like comparing apples to orangutans it cannot be done suffice it to say that one hundred and two dalmatians is even better than the film version of one hundred and one dalmatians that came out in one thousand nine hundred and ninetysix there is a lot to like here from the sight gags the dialogue and the costumes to the casting  it is a good film for the whole family,1
in a time when hollywood is making money by showing our weaknesses despair crime drugs and war along comes this film which reminds us the concept of the indomitable spirit if you are feeling beaten down this movie will free your mind and set you soaring we all know how tough life can be sometime we need to be reminded that persistence and courage will get us through that is what this film did for me and i hope it will for you,1
i still have grainy late night nocable cheap vhs dubs of this show from waaaaaayyyy back when latenightcommercials and all when i would stay up to whatever weird hour they would slap this show on  just so i could tape itthe series was not really about freddy kreuger  only the first couple of episodes actually involved him as anything but a rod serlingesquire announcer instead each episode was a distinct nightmare using the traditional horror themes of horrific childhood dating cannibalism dating money death dating and hmm datingfrom the episode where a teenage boy accidentally says i will love you forever to the wrong girl and is stuck with her literally at least for a moment they grow together to the one where a young stewardess goes home with a strange man only to find herself in his cabin where he has a trophy room full of other stewardesses and one i only vaguely remember which compared blind dates to hockey and the injuries and penalties that go with it  dating was definitely the scariest thing in the seriesone episode had jeffrey combs reanimator etc as a motivated pizza merchant with a tasty new secret ingredient not original but still creepy and funeven so some of the episodes were great my personal favorite was it is a miserable life where a young man is trapped working in his parents burger joint when he wants to go off to college stuck talking to himself and doing little puppet shows with old cheeseburgers  until one late night when a weird guy comes through the drive through and suddenly his life is not the same no not freddy just a thug with a gun  turns out the whole mindblowing episode is just that  the last thoughts that pass through the kids head along with a bulletthe second half of the same episode many of the freddies nightmares episodes were essentially two vaguely connected short stories followed his girlfriend who was also wounded but not killed in the driveby and who is taken to the hospital from heck  they cram in all the most creepy hospital nightmare clichés and then some  from accidentally having your mouth sewn shut  or waking up during an operation  to having your dead boyfriend try and lure you into the morgue for a little cuddleagain that was my favoritesome of the episodes were much dumber like almost all of the ones they have made available on video they put the crummy ones out as representative of the series and then nobody likes them thinks the show stunk and then they do not put any more on video it is a miserable life is only available on pal dvd in england  but i am still going to buy it,1
deliriously romantic comedy with intertwining subplots that mesh beautifully and actors who bounce lines off each other with precise comic timing a feat that is beautiful to behold when chers spineless fiancé asks her to help him make peace with his estranged moody younger brother no one could dream the consequences which follow operatic symbolism catholic church confessions love bites and falling snowmoonstruck is timeless and smooth it takes about fifteen minutes for the pictures rhythm to kick in there is an early sequence with the grandfather and his dogs at the cemetery that is a little rough and a following scene with cosmo and the elderly man at the gate that seems obtuse but the patchwork of the plot is interwoven with nimble skill and the movies wobbly tone and kooky spirit are both infectious onetwo from ,1

just a note to add to the above comment fear of a black hat does not have the criminal who is image has been ripped off by the band that is in cbfour easily confused as the two films are so similar but black hat is vastly the superior of the two yeah,1
how can you take her hardliving glamorously violent bounty hunter story serious with that accent it is absurd apart from that the visual style of the directer is nauseating and gimmicky the plot is a shallow boring confused gangstermovie rehash and the acting is unconvincing the film introduces new characters all the way throughout the film and is told in fragmented flashback  mostly out of sequence  seemingly just to keep you nice and confused the film ever shows you things that do not really happen and then later says that did not really happen this happened  see the apparent killing of the fake first ladies what have we seen the first wrong sequence of events for thenterrible choice in casting a convoluted messy plot and a headacheinducing directorial style onefive,0
first saw this half a lifetime ago on a blackandwhite tv in a small samoan village and thought it was hilarious now having seen it for the second time so much later i do not find it hilarious i do not find anything hilarious anymore but this is a witty and lighthearted comedy that moves along quickly without stumbling and i thoroughly enjoyed itit is one thousand nine hundred and fortyfive and fred macmurray is a fourf who is dying to get into one of the armed forces he rubs a lamp in the scrapyard he is managing and a genie appears to grant him a few wishes ho hum right but though the introduction is no more than okay the fantasies are pretty lively macmurray tells the genie that he wants to be in the army poof and he is marching along with washingtons soldiers into a particularly warm and inviting uso where june haver and joan leslie are wearing lots of lace doilies or whatever they are and lavender wigs washington sends macmurray to spy on the enemy  redcoating germanspeaking hessians not brits the hessians are jammed into a bierstube and singing a very amusing drinking song extolling the virtues of the vaterland where the white wine is winier and the rhine waters rhinier and the bratwurst is mellower and the yellow hair is yellower and the frauleins are jucier and the goose steps are goosier something like that the characterizations are fabulous as good as sig rumanns best otto preminger is the suspicious and sinister hessian general you know heidelberg vee are two hundred and fortyone to one against you  but vee are not afraid i cannot go on too long with these fantasies but they are all quite funny and so are the lyrics when he wishes he were in the navy macmurray winds up with columbus and the fantasy is presented as grand opera do not you know that sailing west meant a terrifically expensive investment and who do you suppose provides the means but isabella queen of queens when they sight the new world someone remarks that it looks great i do not care what it looks like mutters columbus but that place is going to be called columbuslandanyway everything is finally straightened out though the genie by this time is quite drunk and macmurray winds up in the marine corps with the right girli have made it sound too cute maybe but it is cute the kids will enjoy the puffs of smoke and the magic and the corny love story the adults will get a kick out of the more challenging elements of the story who are the hessians unless they happen to be college graduates in which case they might want to stick with the legerdemain and say wow awesome,1
this movie is great if you enjoy watching bclass movies that is this is a classic college eightys slasher movie in which one song is played throughout the entire soundtrack a horrible film but worth renting to make fun of or just to watch old men pop out of closets with knives kind of funny if you ask me,1
this movie is inspiring to anyone who is or has been in a tough jam whether financially or emotionally you will definitely laugh which is the best medicine  left in a bad financial situation when her husband dies grace has to find a new way to make some money and it is not exactly legal which adds to the humour even my boyfriend liked it so do not think that it is a chickflic,1
two houses one street one phone booth one car a girl next door a boy next door and a zombie this list of ingredients should suffice for a great horror movie all you need is some blue light ambient music anddone not in the hands of dutch director van rouveroy though i like to organize bad movie evenings from time to time the concept is really simple get some booze get some filmloving friends and immerse yourself in the worst cinema can offer for such an evening this peace of filth is one of the best laughs guaranteedthe bizarre thing is van rouveroy is still defending her film as if it were a great achievement to be a witness to this you will have to listen to the dvds commentary track again disbelieve and laughs guaranteed,0
i usually steer clear of tv movies because of the many ways you know that it is tv movies five seconds into the picture this one got my attention because of the unusual title and its gloomy wellcrafted mood that is established from the very start while the ever present rain confirmed my suspicions of a misplaced story even if claiming to be set in california the movie was largely shot around a stormy vancouver bc the dark and oppressive outdoors beautifully complement olmos excellent acting,1
caution may contain spoilersi have seen this movie three times  i have liked it every time upon seeing it again i am always reminded of how good it is an hbo tv movie very well done like most of their movies are this would have gotten oscars for it is performances had it been released for general distribution instead of made for tvas i am sure anyone knows from reading other reviews here this is the story of serial murderer andrei chikatilo he murdered fiftysix people over eight years in the former soviet union three victims were buried  could not be found so he was only convicted of fiftytwo out of fiftythree of his murders the story actually focuses more on the forensic analyst victor burakov played to perfection by stephen rea a man that becomes tortured and obsessed with finding this killer despite the additional obstacles placed by party hacks his part is essential to be sure there is a very touching scene towards the end of the movie that mentions how in america investigators are routinely taken off serial killer cases after eighteen months whether they want to or not due to the mental strain  frustration according to this account burakov worked for over five years before getting his first break from it he followed the case to its conclusion three years later in this scene his superior general fetisov played by donald sutherland actually tells him he admires his dedication and apologizes for not knowing he should have given him a break soonerreas performance is so well done he does not overact chew up the scenery or do anything that distracts from his portrayal of a man who is hell bent on finding his killer he is a man with passion but does not show it in the same manner as is so usually portrayed in detective movies he only occasionally gives outbursts after quietly putting up with more than most could stand under such circumstances rea does so much with his face his eyes he does not need to overact he just is  his character so frustrated after so long at one point driven to frustration he actually says he would rather find three at one time than none in a year of course what he means is not that he wants more people to die he just wants some clues to catch this man rea makes us feel for this man he makes us understand but a glimpse of what it is to live with such horror and futilitya mutant to be sure chikatilos childhood was one which produces such monsters the character of chikatilo is very well done by jeffrey demunn he somehow impossible though it may seem elicits some modicum of sympathy for himself perhaps he is the worst of us gone terribly wrong either way his performance is very well donedonald sutherland as colonel fetisov later promoted to general also does a great job he starts out seeming to be a cynical worldly official that does not seem much more interested in helping the investigation than anyone else blocking burakov but he eventually becomes more than just an assistant he actually actively participates in helping burakov there is also a very nice turn by max von sydow as the psychiatrist brought in to help profile and figure out what kind of deviant they are looking foralthough this movie deals with a morbid grotesque and violent story it really is more about what it takes to catch a killer than the killer himself all around a very well done movie with fine performances and a great screenplay the screenplay manages to do what the best of this type of movie does give factual events  place them meaningfully inside a dramatic framework that makes you feel like you know the people behind the factsnine out of ten stars,1
with one of my very favorite actors james spader i expected this film to be at least tolerable it was not after the first half hour i watched the rest of it with the remote control in my hand so the fast forward was at the ready so trite so standard one knows what is going to happen in each scene one can even predict the dialogue word for word this is one of those movies that makes one scratch ones head and say how did this movie ever get made in an effort to say something positive i will add that there are some mildly entertaining special effects but on the whole if you have seen five scifi movies or you are over nine years old do yourself a favor and skip this one,0
alan alda plays reallife sports illustrated writer george plimpton who was once invited to join the detroit lions football team as an honorary member rather wan uncompelling drama curiously tempered with fantasy director alex march takes an interesting tack on this material shooting it in a quasidocumentary fashion with macho commentary and yet giving the tale a touch of capraesque whimsy still by bringing out the cinematic flashiness in this setup he turns the main narrative into a jumble aldas smug uncharismatic performance is another handicap though the supporting cast is filled with reallife proathletes and scintillating lauren hutton as aldas girlfriendhow is that for a fantasy onetwo from ,0
short synopsis this film opens with soldiers being released from the company of men one of them pursues another with a weird scheme the other repeatedly refuses later they both get trapped in an office building in which they want to crack a safe during the christmas holidays hostility turns into playful banter and then into a desperate fight for survival during the bantering they lose all drinkable liquids so it is really serious with exposed well built and well oiled torsos they ram a hole into a wall and finally manage to escape  only to find out that they have been betrayed and set up by women one gets caught the other remains free and is not given away by his companion a last encounter a last light for a cigarette adieu lami farewell friendi found it hard not to see closet homosexuals in the two main characters played by classical heman superstars alain delon and charles bronson they are obviously attracted to each other their treatment of women is abominable and marked by contempt throughout the whole story seems to have a strong symbolic undertow a little like deliverance it is also very stylish the safe the two men want to crack is in a  for the time  ultra modern glass and aluminum tower it is the seat of a publicity firm so there are many fancy posters and wall coverings around the wardrobe is also very good the ultra stylish citroen ds maybe the most modern and elegant car of all times features large in this movie  perhaps a subtle kind of product placementi can recommend this movie for the actors performances alone delon and bronson are really sharing the top billing in a manner that struck me as very fair and sporting both do a considerable amount of acrobatics i have never seen bronson better than here he really acts  and speaks french throughout with a heavy accent buy very passably indeed and it is certainly the man himself we hear so the french language version is highly recommended the police inspector who pursues the two is played by on of my favorite franch character actors bernard fresson who was gene hackmans partner in french connection ii he is the best brainy police inspector i know also very good is former child actress brigitte fossey as the young ingénue who as it turns out is not so innocent as it first seemsanyone who expects the old inanout of classical heist movies might be disappointed with this film for those with a little patience this will be a rewarding experience full of novel and original ideas and directorial quirks although it my be a little too brutal and sadistic for its own sake,1
i saw this a couple of nights back not expecting too much and unsurprisingly it did not deliver anything too exciting the plot set up of a crew of vampire hunters vsan for vampire sanitation going around in their spaceship periodically killing space vamps and rescuing people is quite sound and had the film been handled better it might well have been something quite ace unfortunately after a fairly decent opening the sense of actual quality starts to drain away from the film leaving something behind that though vacantly watchable is quite laughably bad i do not expect anything too special from these films that pop up on the sci fi channel and at least this was not one of their creature features with an atrocious cgi beast shambling about but it was still pretty bad mostly due to the writing and acting but with a sterling contribution to the overall badness made by the horrible music when the film opted just for a typical science fiction sounding weird noises approach to the soundtrack it did ok but all too often hilariously bad soft rock intruded and pitched scenes into silliness i would have tolerated the general cheesy acting and writing more were it not for the choice of music which was a serious miscalculation turning things from cheesy to lamely comical of the acting dominic zamprogna was ok but bland as the nominal hero whilst leanne adachi was pretty irritating as the tough girl of the vamp busting team and aaron pearl played another member who was not well written or interesting enough to make an impression though she did not seem that good at the acting lark natassia malte did well through having a less irritating character than the others and the fact that she is seriously nice to look at the only serious name in the cast is michael ironside and he is underused though he does nicely pretty amusing in a manner one suspects was intentional he seems to have fun and earn his paycheck and his role is entertaining the effects are ok on the whole they are at least of the standards of the average science fiction tv show and there are also a few scenes of blood splatter and a bit of fun gore as well things move along nicely and i almost feel harsh rating this film badly but then i remember bursting into laughter at regular intervals and realising that unless the film is an intentional comedy which i do not think it is then it simply does not succeed too much is lame daft unconvincing its an ok effort i guess but it did not appeal to me only give it a go if you really dig sci fi trash or unintended chuckles i would say,0
i have never seen many online movies in most of my life but if i would pick any of them i would pick spatula madness a clever reference to most movies like star trooper etc using a camera and wits of steel jason steele mastered the art of turning a normal image into a painting and then putting it all together with framebyframe animation to get a world inhabited by spatulas the story begins at the middle how is that for directors delight then the middle is at the beginning and so on when i first watched it i expected a soggy pixely look but jason like me loves looks so took every detail to the max although i do not recommend it for children or would anybody besides me like it but please search it up on the net its a short film look up film cow its style reminds me of south park but less violent ten for the look six for the laughs and six for the story it all comes to a tenten good workjason steele i am anxious to see the movie,1
hello this movie iswellokay just kidding its awesome it is not a block buster smash hit it is not meant to be but its a big hit in my world and my sisters we are rockin rollers go ramones this is a great movie for me,1
before we begin i have a fear of dentists this movie gives me the creeps and even makes me cringe that is what i love about this film the movie is kind of boring for that i take three stars offspoiler alertthe movie revolves around dr alan feinstone who has just found out his wife has been cheating on him soon he begins to have hallucinations and begins torturing his patients killing coworkers and he has even tortured his wife to death and killed the man he was having an affair withend spoiler the movie is very bloody and gory i would recommend it if you are into gorei give this film seven stars out of ten dr alan feinstein is not your normal everyday dentist,1
an independent feature can now be seen as both a work of film art and a video resume enter broken and aggressively promoted twenty minute short with style and enthusiams to spare but is it any good as a film or does it only work as a demo piece ah there in lies the rubbroken is the story of bonnie clayton who is abducted after awakening from a reoccurring nightmare one night by a sadistic stranger and his colorful entourage quote from the video box as she is held captive it becomes obvious that her abductors know things about her that even she did not know about herself while they question her a blackclad soldier guns his way into their hideout in an attempt to rescue her mayhem ensuesfortunately for us director alex ferrari seems to know what he is doing or at least he is very good at faking it broken does not suffer from any lack of visual flair which is especially commendable considering its budget and the inexperience of all involved what it does suffer from is weak and kind of derivative writing think long kiss goodnight meets the matrix written ten minutes after reading fight club the good news for ferrari and producerwriter jorge rodriguez is that the story elements are easily ignored for the oodles of eye candy on display does the plot really matter that much in a twenty minute short meant to show off the technical skills of its creators no not reallythough it would be unfair of me to overlook any negative aspects in light of the films budget and length broken is no genre classic the biggest problem was that it actually would have worked better as a fulllength feature the final twist does not get enough build up time to be shocking if ferrari were allowed the time to slow burn the feature as needed plot elements would seem less random and the film more complete here is to knowing he is getting the chanceaudio brokens dolby digital fiveone presentation is second to none in the indie world i have never heard such aggressive surround from such a small feature the matrix inspired soundtrack is very rich and deep gunshots have punch and even the dialogue gets in on the surround effects of everything presented on this disc it is the audio that speaks the praise for modern independent dvd production also included is an equally impressive dolby twozero surround track which is the menu defaultextras there are literally hours of making of features to be found on this disc there are so many extras in fact that i find it unrealistic to list and describe each of them here while still expecting my readers to continue reading whatever shortcomings the actual short may have the dvd is unprecedented in its informational resources people who enjoyed the film can learn all there is to know about its production including everything from the conceptual art to the promotional campaign those with plans to make an indie film of their own can learn just about everything they need to know from these featuresthe extras are broken down into categorical menus these include preproduction production postproduction after the short and cast and crew bios from a critical standpoint i found that some of the sections were quite short had they been edited into one featurette per menu option they would have been less frustrating to navigate as the curser defaults to the top selection with every return to the main section menu this is of course just nitpicking but perhaps for future dvd releases the filmmakers will take my advice to heartit has six audio commentaries and hours of interview footage and talented people and despite the consonant salesmanship their true colours do shine throughthe willingness to share their filmmaking secrets with anyone who picks up this dvd is quite generous from the extras i learned what editing and effects software is most reliable and effective what brand of camera creates the most professional look for the lowest price even where to get cheap air soft weaponry on top of this i was given several alternate options in case i found myself unable to locate any products used on this particular production wannabe filmmakers unwilling to read a book on the subject would do well to watch this dvdoverall i have scored the actual short as a six out of ten but wish there was an option for feature length potential and effort because i would have scored it an eight or nine in these fields i recommend the dvd for its features and as a perfect example of what can be done with a mere eight thousand american dollars those who purchase the dvd can think of themselves as ghost producers for a larger project as the more attention these guys get the more funding the featurelength version will get,1
deliverance is a stunning thriller every bit as exciting as any good thriller should aspire to be but also stomachchurningly frightening though it is not a horror movie it is just as terrifying as any classic horror film the very thought of being a normal redblooded male enjoying an adventure weekend miles from any form of civilisation only to be captured and sodomised by a couple of violent hillbillies is surely the worst nightmare of ninetyninenine of the worlds population it would have been easy for deliverance to slip into exploitation territory but john boorman has cleverly avoided the temptation to go down such a route and has made a film that explores questions and challenges the very meaning of masculinity with so many films you come away wishing to heaven that you could step into the heros shoes performing heroic deeds and saving the day and getting the girl but with deliverance you come away praying to god that you will never have to experience what these four protagonists go throughfour city guys  ed jon voight lewis burt reynolds drew ronny cox and bobby ned beatty  head out into the wilderness to spend a few days canoing down a soontobedammed river the guys are riding the rapids in pairs and ed and bobby inadvertently get a little too far ahead of the others so they pull in to the riverside and await their pals in the adjacent woodland here they fall foul of two local woodlanders bill mckinney and herbert coward who tie ed to a tree while one of them strips and rapes bobby instructing him perversely to squeal like a pig lewis and drew arrive unseen and lewis being a fair archer kills the rapist while the other hillbilly beats a hasty retreat into the forest under great emotional stress the four canoeists decide to conceal the event and get out of the area but they find the river increasingly dangerous to negotiate as they journey downstream and the risk to their lives heightens when the surviving hillbilly returns to take shots at them with his rifle from some unseen vantage point in the rocky cliffs beside the riverdeliverance is very powerful as a survival tale but even more powerful and disturbing as a study of macho attitudes being torn apart and left in humiliated tatters though all the performances are remarkable one must take particular note of beattys efforts in a role that many actors would have turned down the film is very similar thematically to the one thousand nine hundred and seventyone film straw dogs  both films deal with terrifying sexual violence in isolated locales and in both the eventual violent revenge exacted by the victim does not result in any sense of satisfaction the backdrop of the rugged countryside in deliverance is beautiful to look at but it also adds to the tension by placing the four canoeists in a setting where they are at the mercy of the hillbillies and the landscape with nobody to rely on other than themselves this truly is suspenseful filmmaking at its finest,1
that reviewers liked this movie surprises me the plot is a muddle the characters are wooden michael bowen spends most of the film spying on the other characters and misjudging all of them no one has any redeeming quality or pointofinterest this is not an edgy work it is not imaginative it is not ironic it is no clever there is nothing straight forward about this tedious work that is missed theatrical release is not surprise that the this network airs it diminishes that venue i definitely recommend turning to a rerun of the garden smart show on pbs or even a good informational if you encountered this mess on late night television if you encounter it on daytime television take a long walk even if you walk in smog you will feel better not having suffered through this shambles life is short this movie is long,0
i really liked this movieit was cute i enjoyed it but if you did not that is your fault emma roberts played a good nancy drew even though she is not quite like the books the old fashion outfits are weird when you see them in modern times but she looks good on them to me the rich girls did not have outfits that made them look rich i mean it looks like they got all the clothes blindfolded at a garage sale and just decided to put it on all together all of the outfits were tacky especially when they wore the penny loafers with their regular outfits i do not want to make the movie look bad because it definitely was not just go to the theater and watch it you will enjoy it,1
people i know is a clunker with no one to root for and no one to care about  despite the game efforts of a talented castpacino delivers his usual tour de force as eli wurman a pasthisprime publicity agent hollowed out by a lifetime of moral corruption but unlike michael corleone it is impossible to have an emotional investment in this character his dilemma or his fatethe film traces elis preparations for a benefit for a liberal political because while distracted by a clients ryan oneal good in an underwritten part latest dirty laundry  in this case a tv actress companion who is gotten involved with the wrong people tea leoni brings her customary star power to this supporting role although again the script does not give her much to work with as elis sisterinlaw kim basinger manages to evoke sympathy despite implausible plot mechanicsthis movie is strictly for those who like watching pacino strut his stuff and enjoy the other principals unfortunately between the script and direction people i know is strictly amateurish hence its limited theatrical release and speedy journey to dvd consider yourself warned,0
i can see why this film was oscarnominated for best live action short as it was constructed masterfully even if you do not particularly like the blues though to me this sounded much more like jazz you can easily appreciate this film it is simply very well made though for the life of me i cannot see why director gjon mili only got to direct one filmthis one in other words the film is nominated and yet the director did not get any sort of career boost as for the black performers i could understand this not causing their careers to shift into high gear as unfortunately most of white society have indifference or worse for blacks or that kind of musicif you do watch this film if you are not particularly enjoying the earlier portion skip ahead to about the fivefifty markwhere it picks up considerably when the lady stopped singing and the performers began to improvise the pace improved quite a bit,1
this is a film of immense appeal to a relatively welldefined group of which i am not a part i went to a preview of this movie not knowing what to expect  i ultimately found it disappointing the history of a dreadfully dysfunctional oftentimes downright twisted hungarian jewish family is not my cup of tea an epic saga like this should really provide its viewers with something more in the end ultimately pictures such as this are about the human condition  this picture cast almost no new light on any of its more meaningful facets,0
i have zero interest rap and in ghetto culture i am white and like classic rock however that did not stop me from appreciating this fantastic comedy its pretty much a sequel of this is spinal tap in the sense that it is the same movie just about rap instead or rock yet it is hilarious there are many funny jokes but not without a few jokes that just fall flat the characters are all very funny and believable i watched just because it made me laugh at three am and any movie that can do that warrants at least a test screening one of the reasons why this movies was so funny was that it makes fun of rap from a different rap today is concerned with the wrong things and get by with studio noise and little talent this movie comes from a time where rappers deserved more credit overall it is a funny movie with many jokes about racism sex and music culture among the more obvious themes of humor this is highly recommend for any fan of this is spinal tap they are essentially the same movie just about different worlds and yes the same jokes work in both movies,1
i am not entirely sure rob schmidt qualifies as a master in the genre of horror since he previously just directed one horror film called wrong turn and that one was actually just was slightly above mediocre but fact is that he made with right to die one of the best and creepiest episodes of the entire second season of the masters of horror franchise there was a similar underdog story in season one when william malone made on of the best episodes with the fair haired child even though his other long feature films fear dot com and house on haunted hill sucked pretty badlythe story of right to die cleverly picks in on the nowadays piping hot social debate of euthanasia but thankfully also features multiple oldfashioned horror themes like ghostly vengeance murderous conspiracies pitch black humor and comic book styled violence whilst driving home late one night and discussing the husbands continuous adultery the addison couple are involved in a terrible car accident cliff walks away from the wreck unharmed but his wife abby is fully burned and needs to be kept alive artificially whilst cliff and his sleazy attorney corbin bernsen of the dentist want to plug the plug on her and sue the car constructor abbeys mum sets up a giant media campaign to keep her daughter alive as a vegetable and blame everything on cliff meanwhile abbeys hateful spirit comes back for revenge and kills someone in cliffs surrounding whenever she has a near fatal experience with the medical devices after a few victims cliff realizes it might be safer for him to keep his wife alive if he wants to remain alive as well right to die is a stupendous episode and exactly the type of stuff i always hoped to see from a tvseries concept like masters of horror it is violent and gory with a sick  twisted sense of humor and loads of sleaze sequences the euthanasia theme and the whole obligatory media circus that surrounds it is processed into the script very well yet without unnecessarily reverting to political standpoints or morality lessons the atmosphere is suspenseful and the killing sequences are suitably nasty and unsettling actresses julia anderson and robin sydney both have pretty face and impressively voluptuous racks which is always a welcome plus and corbin bernsen is finally offered the chance again to depict a meanspirited and egocentric bastard great moh episode definitely one of the highlights of both seasons,1
i will admit that i did not give this movie much of a chance i decided pretty early on that this just was not my kind of moviefor the most part it has an excellent look in terms of its cinematography the scenes of early seventys manhattan look very good as does the lead actress it is a very crisp black and white which could almost make the movie feel undated and fresh however some of the other techniques the filmmakers employ shoot that prospect all to hell the disjointed editing is very latesixtys somewhere between surrealism and new wave the story also feels like it came from a very specific time somewhere between free love idealism and artsy experimentationthe film follows a young girl around the city as she looks for a man who she had anonymous phone sex with as she meets other odd characters she reveals her quirks and they reveal theirs the movie seems to be meant as an offthewall irreverent comedy but adds an avantgarde feel i would expect that if you like andy warhol movies you would be very excited to discover the telephone booksome problems i had near the end of the movie one character tells a rambling anecdote that lasts over twelve minutesbrutal to sit through also there is a very explicit animation sequence that i found gross and juvenile that serves as the films climax i did laugh out loud four or five times and i liked the ending minus the flatout disgusting animation and when the film switched to color for the final phoneboothatnight sequence i actually liked the way it looked even better it ended up being one of those experiences where i felt like i could have really liked it if it been a little different but this is what the filmmakers gave us it is obscure artsy and way left of the dial but none of those are reasons to recommend it on their own i did not find it to be unique or creative so much as forced and pretentious,0
some people loved the aristocrats and others hated it frequently walking out in the middle reactions to eddie izzard are not likely to be that extreme  if you can handle a transvestite comedian who says he likes girls and has a vocabulary that makes shall we say enough use of the f word that his program would be one long beep if presented on network television many of izzards fans are so devoted that they see no flaws whatsoever in his performances on the other hand i thought this show was occasionally flatter than izzards chest but also more often than not funny and in spots absolutely hilarious he has a way of connecting references from routines early in the show to his later routines he is not a story teller he is not a joke maker he is not a frenetic fantasist like robin williams he plays around with ideas some of which work and some of which  a routine with the san francisco cable car and alcatraz for instance  are completely unfunny he has a way however of moving gracefully past the flopped routines and extending the ones that connect i gave this performance a seven and might be persuaded to raise it to an eight but a ten no way,1
eleven oscar nominations and zero win am yet to understand why  its not like the actors in the movie did any better thereafter that you can make it by giving them awards for trivial roles like it was done with halle berry and denzel washington  whoopi oprah margaret avery danny glover etc were all amazing  i am curious to get scripts of the discussions at the oscars that year it should go into the shouldawould havecoulda category for the judges its an amazing book  but true to alice walkers style of writing she has a way of seeming like she is exaggerating her characters  so i am so glad that they screen adaptation took a few things out the cinematography was amazing  the african scenes live much to be desired  the african part in the book is supposed to be set in liberia  somewhere in west africa  but oh no steven spielberg thinks the world is so dumb that they cannot think of africa outside of the safaris  so yes there had to be a complimentary zebra and wildlife scene when we all know there are none west africa  and most of all why get the people to speak swahili  who in west africa speaks swahili i just had to get that out of the waybut as a story  amazing filmmaking  out of this world  classic yesi own it and i watch it when my soul needs some rejuvenation,1
i have read the book a couple of times and this movie does not follow exactly as it should i could let this slide it is after all a movie however i have serious issues with the setting of the movie nobody has seemed to mention that this movie and the book it is based on are based in actual events that happened in nebraska i live in nebraska i grew up in the town that this movie is supposed to be based on first of all the small town that is talked about as the setting is the third largest city in the state with a population of around fiftyzero grand island is the largest city between lincoln and denver second the scenery for the movie is wrong grand island is in the platte river valley which is very flat with very few trees i tried watching this movie but it made me mad to see my hometown being treated so bad this was a real event large sections of the city were wiped out in the book they talk about riding bikes from mormon island to fonner park i guess you could if you do not mind a fifteen mile ride each way for anyone who wants to know what really happened go here ,0
this is one powerful film the first time i saw it the scottish accents made it tough for me to understand a lot and that ruined the viewing experience i gave up on it but then acquired the dvd used the english subtitles when i needed them and really got into this movie discovering just how good it is it is excellentthe widescreen picture makes it spectacular in parts with some wonderful rugged scenery and the story reminded me of braveheart an involving tale of good versus evil here it is liam neeson good vs tim roth evil both do their jobs wellfew actors come across as despicable as roth man you really want to smack this guy in his arrogant irritating puss he is so nasty and vile the sick critics love his character more than anyone elses here neeson is a mans man and a solid hero figure as gibson was in braveheart jessica lange is strong in here as the female lead the movie draws you in and gets you totally involved so prepared to have an emotional experience viewing this,1
why is it that any film about cleopatra the last phaoroh brings out the worst in movie making whatever attraction the woman had for the greatest roman of them all julius ceasar and his successor mark anthony never seems to come across on the screen as other than the antics of over sexed high school seniors despite lavish sets and costumes this movie is as bad as any italian sandals and toga extravaganza of the fiftys admittedly this kind of spectacular belongs on the big screen which is why gladiator went over well but gladiator did not have all the romance novel sexmiss varela has as little acting talent as elizabeth taylor but timothy dalton has talent to spare pity some of it did not wash off on the others,0
whenever people ask me to name the scariest movie i have ever seen i invariably reply black noon and to this day nobodys ever heard of iti watched it alone some thirty years ago at the tender age of thirteen when my parents had gone out for the evening as far as i know its only ever been shown once in the uk and sadly is unavailable on dvd or vhsif anyone can trace a copy please let me knowif i watched it again now it would probably be a big disappointment but it has always stuck in my memory as a particularly disturbing little film,1
i was really looking forward to this movie based on the previews and press it received but after viewing it i was terribly disappointed slums is a totally unfunny film mixed with a todd solondz type of disturbing family reality sans todds brand of humor the story drags along and each scene is worse than the last maybe i missed the point but if this film is an example of every girls growing up experience i am glad to be a man,0
when thinking about captivity many words come to mind among them are uninteresting unentertaining unsuspensful unsexy unfathomable and unwatchablei used to hate those movies from the mid to late nineties that were basically ripoffs of scream but these new saw knockoffs are beginning to make those films look like classics they still pander to the same demographic that those other movies were so successful at doing but now they add a new level of degeneracy that make the twelve to fourteen year old girls they are aimed at feel like they are hardcore and hipthis movie is a load of boring crap what the hell has happened to larry cohen his name has not been attached to anything good since one thousand nine hundred and ninetythree even so i was still surprised to see that he had anything to do with something this bad was anyone surprised when the movies love interest turned out to be one of the psychopaths did anyone not know it when they first saw him only someone who has never before in his or her life ever seen another movie,0
this is one of the shallowest episodes in that the plot really seemed like an excuse to just have fun but i appreciated this lighthearted approach and this is truly one of the best episodes to see on a purely fun level think about itthe crew members have encounters with the white rabbit and alice from wonderland a bengal tiger a samurai warrior a knight on horseback who kills mccoy and a host of other seemingly bizarre events that just do not make any sense at all until the very end despite all the danger you just cannot take everything very seriouslyit is just too fun and the whole episode seems very surreal so on a purely nonaesthetic level it is great stuff,1
normally i am not the sort to be scared by horror movies but this movie is the exception some how this movie got into my mind it is a very simple movie but at the same time extremelly effective it has great atmosphere and this leads to some shocking moments the girls father coming down the hill is a real standout another seen was the family photo i was not expecting that and i jumped out my seat i would recommend everyone to see this movie with the lights out it will stay with you for a long time,0
the premise may seem goofy but since murphys character does not take it seriously it helps ease the audience into this mix of mysticism and modernday hardboiled child abduction excellent cast particularly charles dance and charlotte lewis and murphy is at the height of his eightys peak in comedyaction there is also some great fx a very surreal dream sequence and a fairly original plot often overlooked in the pantheon of murphy flicks but this one is worth a look,1

return of the jedi is often remembered for what it did wrong rather than what it did right and that is a shame because the last chronological installment in the star wars saga is a shining example of epic storytelling it manages to wrap up all story lines of the previous movies in one grand finale and does so very convincinglyyes there are ewoks  cute and cuddly bears that arguably served to broaden the star wars demographic  and in the middle the movie tends to slow down a bit but the final hour is arguably the best piece of the entire saga where luke finally comes face to face with darth vader the most recognizable villain in movie historyreturn of the jedi did so many things right that people tend to overlook it presented an incredible conclusion to the darth vader storyline which went from slightly implausible in the empire strikes back to very convincing here an exciting opening at jabbas palace a masterful performance of ian mcdiarmid as the emperor luke finally coming into his own the resolution of solo and leias romance and the extremely powerful final moments on the endor moonyes there are slight annoyances but they are the annoyances of a generation of moviegoers who have had time to nitpick every single scene it is still a magical and moving piece of cinema that also serves as a great final chapter it is not a good movie  it is fantastic,1
the us appear to run the uk police who all run around armed to the teeth and did you know that cid officers change into uniform when they stop work and go down the pub this has got to be one of the most unrealistic films with the worst portrayal of real uk police that has ever been foisted on the unsuspecting public i can see that mr snipes might have needed the money to pay his back tax bill but what the heck a good actor like charles dance was doing in it is a mysteryworse than the worse low budget b film of the fiftys an hour and a half of suicide and time i will never get backavoid it like the veritable plague,0
i do not often go out of my way to write comments but for this i had to just to warn anyone that might think that by watching this they will see a comedy this does not come close while the premise change in colourgenderwhatever is bad enough and has been done better many times beforethe actual transformation of two black guys into two white girls is one of the least convincing transformations ever put on screen it would be bad enough if all that was required by the script was a change to white chicks however the wayans brothers are required to disguise themselves as two specific white women as you will have guessed by now they fail completely i have seen drag queens without makeup make more convincing women than these two do with the best special effects and makeup people that hollywood can provide its appalling add to the mix a basketball player built like a building terrible dialogue and more plot holes than a golf course and this film hits a new personal low and i like bad movies avoid like the plague,0
too many sources routinely lump this thoughtprovoking period drama in part based on historical fact together with the superficially similar nunsploitation which was a mainstay in seventys euro trash cinema overlooking the righteous anger that drives the whole endeavor perhaps coincidentally it was also director gianfranco mingozzis singular attempt at narrative filmmaking outside of many wellreceived documentariessafely set within a historical context flavia charts the growing rebellion of an early fifteenth century italian nun florinda bolkans career performance even surpassing her sterling work in lucio fulcis devastating do not torture a duckling locked away in convent by her not so nobleman father in a desperate attempt to curb the girls budding sensuous nature wondering why women are relegated to secondary roles at best in life as in holy scripture she is confronted by ways in which male domination can rupture female lives inspiring revolt fueled by the ranting of semicrazed older sister agatha indelibly portrayed by veteran actress maria casarès from marcel carnés les enfants du paradis and  more constructively  by a muslim invasion joining the oppressors and perhaps unwittingly manipulating them to do her bidding flavia truly becomes the outcast she already felt herself to be with expected tragic resultswith its breathtaking widescreen compositions by alfio contini who shot michelangelo antonionis zabriskie point this is an uncompromising and austere account of one womans fierce yet ultimately futile fight against patriarchal society which allotted her no rights beyond childbearing or whoring as sister agatha wryly remarks a lengthy druginduced fantasy sequence clearly modeled on ken russells otherwise far more flamboyant devils notwithstanding the movie turns out relatively stingy in the skin department making something of a mockery out of its semiporn reputation this is a serious work deserving rediscovery and restoration of its unjustly tarnished reputation,1
despite the title the sword bearer and the dvd cover actionherioc poses of the sword bearer this is not a super hero filmminor spoilers it follows the tale of sasha the sword bearer who is cursed with having a retractable sword in his forearm cool you say but no this is real life if you had this power as a child could you control it when say faced by a mad man or when your mums boyfriend is beating her and if you do not control it how do you cope with being a two time killer at the age of twelvethis essentially is where sasha is when we meet him wandering aimlessly after another killing much like a bout de soufflé he then meet katya and the pair fall instantly in love providing sasha with a real reason to live and try and changes his ways however his past is still chasing him in the form of two police officersthat is essentially the story and there is virtually no action on screen though a lot if suggestedi really like this movie unlike many hollywood super hero films we get very little back story there is no bad guy unless you count the sword bearer himself abut there is a lot of heart and good character developmentworth checking out if you can find it,1
strangely enough this movie never made it to the big screen in denmark so i had to wait for the video release my expectations where high but they where in no way disappointed as always with ang lee there is fantastic acting an intelligent and thrilling plot that has you guessing right till the end and superb filming along with unforgiven this is easily one of the two best westerns of the ninetyspeople who expect something along the line of mel gibson in the patriotcorny or braveheartacceptable will be sourly disappointed all others who appreciate the above mentioned qualities will have a fantastic time watching it nine out of ten,1
before i go on i have to admit to being a huge bon jovi fan in fact that is what attracted me to the dvd case in the first place i probably would have bought it anyway being such a big horror fan and having enjoyed the first vampires title so muchbut this is not half as good not even jon could save this film for me my main problem would be that it simply is not scary apart from jons character derek bliss none of the other characters make an impression and you could not care less whether they die or not especially the annoying vampire  drug addict woman the female vampire simply is not scary or sexy rather she looks like an anorexic fourteen year girl no wonder she is so desperate for blood then another huge problem is that everything is just too bright there is no atmosphere or sense of dread i know the first vampires being set in new mexico was not exactly the twilight zone in terms of creepiness but yet it still managed to be dark and foreboding when it needed to be this film has no tension like thatthe story is basically the same as before vampire wants berziers cross to be able to walk in daylight however the story has less cool bits this time there is no wow factor in knowing this is the master of all master  the original vampire as in the first film you really do not care who or what this one is there is no army of masters instead she hides out in some old ruin which looks more like a disneyland attraction then a creepy templeso there you have it really lack of scares lack of atmosphere lack of interesting story a real let down for me personally,0
william powells final outing as philo vance occurs in the kennel murder case where the murder of a championship show dog leads to two more murders and one attempt of the human kind it is all in the figuring out of how that leads to the who and whythe philo vance murders by ss van dine were most popular at the time and the clever mr van dine figured out a way to sell his books one at a time to the highest studio bidder this is why you see so many philo vances and so many studios putting them out had bill powell not gone on to greater fame with mgm as nick charles of the thin man series he would have been known as the greatest of philo vances it turns out that powell had entered his little terrier captain in the same contest where the murdered dog was entered and then another rival owner became the first murder victim as usual powell shows up eugene palette as sergeant heath whose biggest contribution to the proceedings was using his bulk to break down the locked from the inside door where the first murder victim was foundi did say locked from the inside and it was an upper story so it was in figuring out the how powell has a lovely group of suspects as extensive as what normally is in a thin man mystery people like paul cavanaugh helen vinson ralph morgan mary astor fill their cast roles wellwarner brothers liked this version so much that in fact they remade it again in the thirties with james stephenson in his one and only outing as philo vance it does not hold a candle to this oneas this is the only powell philo vance that is out on vhs or dvd by all means see this one or acquire it if you can,1
this series is set a year after the mission to abydos in the movie stargate it explains a lot of the stuff that the movie neglected to mention such as how was the stargate activated without a human computer where did the goauld ras race come from how many are there the first episode has a retired jack oneill spelled with two ls recalled to active duty by general george hammond due to an attack by the shut down stargate from apophis a powerful goauld who killed four men and kidnapped one woman we meet samantha carter a brilliant scientist who claims that she should have gone through the stargate the first time and is determined to go through now we find out that daniel got married on abydos and that there are hundreds of gate addresses that they can dial then daniels wife gets captured by apophis and becomes his new queen it continues in the second episode where general hammond announces the formation of the sgc which includes nine teams in which jacks team will be sgone which consists of jack samantha and daniel they go to chulak a goauld homeworld to rescue daniels wife and another one captured at abydos named skara they get captured and just as apophis gives the order to kill them and many other prisoners a jaffa named tealc first prime of apophis saves them and goes to earth with them where he is made part of sgone that was only the beginning of the adventure in the course of the show they have gone to the past and future gotten transported to alternate realities swapped bodies grown old met alien races which include a rebel alliance of goauld called the tokra in which samanthas dad becomes a member the asgard a cute little race in which we see thor most often he is jacks buddyand avoid global disaster by the skin of their teeth countless timesthe show was recently canceled but lasted ten seasons in season nine a new enemy called the ori came in flaunting brand new powers new dangers and bringing to light new mysteries surrounding the stargate and its creators the ancients season nine and ten also saw the introduction to two new characters ben browder as cameron mitchell the new leader of sgone and claudia black as vala maldoran a female human from another world who brings a new sense of fun to the team very wellproduced interesting characters fantastic special effects and a subtle love interest between samantha and jack this one has it all a different way of travelling the galaxy and different kinds of adventures this is one show you do not want to miss unlock the gate and step through you will not regret it,1
there is so many negative reviews about stay away joe in here i just cannot stay quiet any longer and let this injustice happen here is a side you have not heard yetelvis presleys movies are my guilty pleasure for a simple reason they are perfect films for a pure relaxation because i do not have to think when i watch them that means i do not have to worry about missing a complex plot because there never is a proper plot to start with i can just kick off my shoes grab a beer sit back switch off my brains and enjoy all the general wackiness and catchy easygoing rock n roll tunes from the grooviest decade of them allin my books stay away joe definitely falls into the so bad it is goodcategory now if you are like me and appreciate the trash value this is the ultimate one thousand nine hundred and sixtys camp experience it is so bad that it is almost surrealistic to watch and just when you think that it cannot possibly get any worse it surprises you in the most imaginable ways in the end you are so amazed by all the new levels of stupidity you just do not know whether to laugh or cry in a nutshell i love it because it is so damn amusing that there once was a generation that actually made films like this i still give it one out of ten though  once it hits the bottom one hundred it will became an instant bad movie classic,0
this sports a nice deep cast but for a thriller you better deliver more than name actors and talk the first third of this movie was nothing but talk and more talk most of that was a bunch of women bitching about everything to each other the first five listed actors in here are women so that verifies that it is really a chick flick and little else this probably plays on the lifetime networkthere was a quick murder scene and then more talk by halfway through they had lost me by the way sally field looked about fifteen years old in here,0
i did not think the french could make a bad movie but i was clearly very wrong as has been said before this film essentially uses its title character as a point of departure its portrayal of her life and person have little or nothing to do with the real artemisia gentileschi the script is awful  pretentious stilted and vapid  and its rewriting of the facts is unusually offensive even in a genre that all too often makes its living by distorting rather than retelling history along with some fairly decent set design valentina cervis physical charms are the primary asset of this movie and it is obvious from the beginning that the filmmakers were aware of this too they waste no time in contriving various erotic sequences which have far more to do with titillation than with plot or character development unfortunately the appeal of seeing a pretty young girl in a state of feigned sexual arousal cannot and does not sustain this movie the acting is unremarkable and the score is all too generic despite an interesting chord or two the cinematography is ok and there are some pretty colors but there are also some pretty ridiculous sequences using distortedlens effects more appropriate for a one thousand nine hundred and sixtys freakout movie than a costume drama in any event the script leaves the camera dwelling all too often on artemisias body and all too seldom on her paintingsall told a nearcomplete failure it is not intelligent or tasteful enough to be a serious film and it is too slow and pretentious to work as softcore pornography so the french can fail after all,0
things to come is that rarity of rarities a film about ideas many films present a vision of the future but few attempt to show us how that future came about the first part of the film when war comes to everytown is short but powerful ironically film audiences in its release year laughed at reports that enemy planes were attacking englandappeasement was at its height wells prediction was borne out all too soon the montage of endless war that follows while marred by subpar model work is most effective the explanatory titles are strongly reminiscent of german expressionist graphic design the art director was the great william cameron menzies and his sets of the ruins of everytown are among his best work margaretta scott is very seductive as the chiefs mistress the everytown of the twentyonest century is an equally striking design the acting in the twentyonest century story is not compellingperhaps this was a misfired attempt to contrast the technocratic rationality of this time with the barbarism of one thousand nine hundred and seventy unfortunately the model work representing angry crowds rushing down elevated walkways is laughably bad and could have been done much better even with thirtys technology this is particularly galling since the scenes of the giant aircraft are very convincing this is redeemed by raymond masseys magnificent speech that concludes the filmrarely has the ideal of scientific progress been expressed so well masseys final question is more relevant now than ever in an era of severely curtailed manned spaceflight the scene is aided by the stirring music of sir arthur bliss whose last name i proudly shareunfortunately the vhs versions of this film are absolutely horrible with serious technical problems most versions have edited out a rather interesting montage of futuristic workers and machines that takes us from one thousand nine hundred and seventy to two thousand and thirtyeight i hope a good dvd exists of the entire film,1
this film like astaires royal wedding  which was shown after it on turner classic network last night is famous for a single musical sequence that has gained a place in gene kellys record like fred astaire dancing with a clothing rack and later dancing around a rooms walls and ceiling this film had gene kelly dancing in a cartoon sequence with jerry mouse the sequence is nicely done what is forgotten is that kelly is telling the story behind the cartoon sequence to dean stockwell and his fellow child students at school during a break in the day and sets the stage for the sequence by having stockwell and the others shut their eyes and imagine a pastoral type of background kelly even changes the navy blues he actually wears into a white pomeranian navy uniform with blue stripes on it jerry mouse does more than dance with gene he actually talks  a first that he did not repeat for many decades he also finally puts tom cat into his proper place  tom briefly appears as king jerrys butler trying to cheer him with a platter of cheesesbut the sequence of the cartoon with kelly took about seven minutes of the movie far more of this peculiar film is taken up with kellys story of the lost four day furlough in hollywood and how kelly ends up meeting katherine grayson and with frank sinatra stalking jose iturbi at the mgm film studio the hollywood bowl and iturbis own home except that the two sailors mean no harm this film could have been quite disturbingkelly has saved sinatras life in the pacific and is getting a medal as a result they are both among the crewmen back in california who are getting a four day leave but the script writers to propel what would be a short film  kelly has plans to spend four days having sex with one lola an unseen good time girl in hollywood saddle gene with frank it seems frank is one of those idiots that appear in film after film of the movie factories particularly musical comedies who are socially underdeveloped and in need of instruction about meeting girls or guys if the characters are women frank insists that gene help teach him how to get a girl just then a policeman takes them to headquarters to help the cops with a little boy stockwell who insists on joining the navy and will not give the cops his real name and address when a protesting kelly is able to get this information out of stockwell by asking him some straight questions which the cops could not ask they insist kelly take the boy home to his aunt grayson still protesting kelly gets saddled with increasingly complicated problems mostly due to sinatras simplistic soul view of things he misses seeing lola the next day by sleeping late  sinatra felt he looked so peaceful sleeping he did not wake him up he keeps getting dragged back to graysons house as sinatra feels she is the right woman for himself but needs kelly to train him in love makingi suppose my presentation of the plot may annoy fans of anchors aweigh but i find this kind of story irritating while the singing and dancing and concert music of kelly sinatra grayson and iturbi are first rate it is annoying to have to take the idiocies of someone like sinatras character seriously in the real world kelly would have beaten the hell out of him at the start for following him at the beginning of the four day furlough  what right has he to insist as sinatra does that someone who saves their life should assist him on learning how to date that kind of crap always ruins the total affects of a musical for me  unless the musical numbers are so superior as to make me forget this type of nonsensethe stalking of iturbi is likewise annoying kelly tries to get grayson to like sinatra when he says sinatra can get her a meeting with jose iturbi to audition her singing ability for much of the rest of the picture sinatra and kelly try to do that and keep floundering at one point  for no really good reason  grayson herself ruins kellys attempt to get an interview at mgm with iturbi it is only sheer luck that iturbi feels sorry for an embarrassed grayson that she does give him an audition of her talent kelly by the way ends up with grayson sinatras conscience at not being able to help her see iturbi makes him ashamed of his bothering her but not pulling kelly into it oddly enough and he meanwhile accidentally stumbles into meeting a waitress pamela britton from his native brooklyn and naturally without any assistance from kelly sinatra and britton fall in love ahconsistency thy name is not screenwriting necessarily,1
i never saw this movie until i bought the tape last year i was enthralled and entertained it has all the elements of what i love to see in a scifi story in a book or on the screen there is social commentary speculation and a good storythere is something eerie and amusing watching a one thousand nine hundred and thirtysix view of the distant future of the sixtys and seventysi think it is a must see and not only for scifiers,1
flame in flame out that seems to be gammera in a nutshell a prehistoric creature who can take it and dish it out with equal abandon i am not a fan of japanese monster films but wound up committed to viewing all the flicks on the fifty film dvd scifi collection put out by mill creektreeline films it is a great value at about twenty five bucks so at fifty cents per movie it really boils down to an investment in time to watch some of the goofy offeringsgammera is riled from a centuries long slumber by a nuclear blast and he is not happy like godzilla he takes it out on tokyo setting the united nations into motion to try and come up with a plan to save the planet they arrive at plan z the hope of the world and would not you know it there is a scene where a huge she would is shown that is called the z plan building that was a nice touchby the mid one thousand nine hundred and sixtys this country still was not quite politically correct one of the american military scenes at the alaskan air defense sector has general arnold asking a female sergeant to make coffee i guess there were not any privates aroundgood old gammera was quite the sight though walking around on two legs and going for the flame throwing routine when challenged that is why it surprised me how plan z managed to capture turtle man in the nose cone of a hidden space ship whisking him off to mars to save the world high fives all around for the american and russian team that made the save now let us get back to the cold warlike godzilla gammera spawned at least a good dozen films but having seen this one pretty much satisfies my interest in flying flaming turtles especially since that dvd pack i mentioned earlier has attack of the monsters with a featured guest appearance by the big g it took all i had to make it through to the end of both films it was such a relief to get to the final frame in this one that said gammera sayonara,0
you know i went to see the hills have eyes two wanting to like it i really enjoyed the original and the remake was fairly entertaining they obviously had more money to throw around than wes craven did on special effects the second time around even though i still prefer the original film the remake was done well and it was kind of a guilty pleasure for me bloody intense and great special effects in short a great popcorn movie for any horror fanwhich brings us to the hills have eyes two man where do i start the plot or lack of one is paper thin we are not exactly breaking new ground herethe military has decided to monitor the area and all of these people turn up missing so what do we do now let us send in the national guard to investigate in true hollywood fashion we need to make them the dumbest and worst soldiers ever seen gee i have never seen that premise before to make a long story short you have the mutants killing off the moron soldiers one at a time in graphic fashion once again the special effects by nicotero are great but the kills no matter how graphic become boring and predictable honestly it seemed to me that this flick was done just to grab a quick buck it was bloody and graphic but i found it predictable boring and not scary at all for me it would have been nice if this film contained one original thoughtwes craven and his son shared the writing duties and he has been involved with many of my favorite horror films but sadly this is not one of them,0
i bought the dvd of before sunset and saw it for the first time a week ago having saw it twice i could not help but missing before sunrise not because the sequel was not as great but i felt that these two movies completed each other like no other sequels ever did every time i finished watching one of them i feel the need and yearning to see the other so i ended up spending the weeks watching both of them repeatedly i will be quite embarrassed to mention how many times exactly the most remarkable thing about before sunrise is how you feel the development of the feelings of their characters towards each other it sounds so simple the growing of the chemistry i think other romantic films might think that they succeed to track the development but to me  who does not believe in nora ephron  before sunrise is the first film to really gives the viewers chance to feel it when i saw it for the first time about eight year ago when i was twenty i already liked it but i did not rate it as a great film it still seemed to me like another thinking persons feel good movie linklater was too smart to make it more realistic it was ten minutes too long the characters was too well fabricated i thought i liked it because it was like a dream and because i enjoyed their conversations etc etc but now thanks to before sunset i feel that is more to before sunrise than what i felt for it before i saw the elements more clearly jesse celine vienna their conversations everything how each of them are separated element by itself and they have a chance to mix the story is just a frame of time i am no longer feel manipulated and the freedom that every scene has as well as its refusal to be overly efficient how blind i was that those qualities did not strike me as exceptional when i first saw it now eight year have passed the more movies i have seen the more i realize that many movies are just collections of ordered scenes that only exist for the sake of its ending even movies like pulp fiction or linklaterss own slackers included the jesse and celine tale avoid that maybe before sunset is a better example in this case but before sunrise is also one of few films that its ending is just a consequence of time not a destination every single scene has its own life i do not know whether linklater or anyone else had a sequel in mind when they made before sunrise but to me one of the most amazing things about these sequels are how these two films visually contrast each other before sunrise which i think employs more static angels and brighter color schemes seems to try to capture the smallest atoms of liveliness surrounding jesse and celine the world is always full of hope whether or not the characters feel it meanwhile i enter the vision of boredom as jesse stuck talking to the journalists in before sunset and celines first smile from behind the shelves are the most heartbreaking smile i have seen in a beginning of a film and the many moving shots after that takes me to a place i do not know with a sadness in me no matter how beautiful paris is and no matter how happy i am that they meet again i am sorry that i go on this long with my limited english before sunrise is already an extraordinary film without me pouring my scattered thoughts and it gets even better with an equally great sequel following it,1
being the prototype of the classical errol flynn adventure movie and having a good story as well as two more brilliant costars in maureen ohara what an exquisite beauty and anthony quinn i can only recommend this movie to all those having even the slightest liking for romance and adventurehollywood at its best,1
first saw this movie in about one thousand nine hundred and ninety and absolutely died laughing through it it became a cult favorite with my circle of friends and we would quote from it at the drop of a hat i am going home in a bag needless to say the humor is still there fifteen years later it is become a tradition at halloween time to expose many of my new friends to this film good thing you can still buy it off ebay i have found that halloween candy tastes much better with your tongue planted firmly in your cheekand this movie provides it all pathos suspense unrequited lovenobility and the list goes on royal dano provides an amazing heartfelt performance as old man wrenchmuller i remember seeing him in the seven faces of dr lao as a bad guy who met a bad end here you really feel for the old guy right from the beginning if you are not careful you will miss some of the levels of humor in this movie the creators got real subtle in many ways with offhand comments little subtle costume digs at other scifi movies and even a scene ripped from the pages of wile e coyotedo not spend too much thought processes trying to analyze a movie people this is fun fare without the need for nitpicking and should not be offensive to anyone well maybe stupid people but they will not know they are being mockednow if you will excuse me i am going to go get a zagnut barramsay rc cowlishaw karaoke djentertainer,1
i wanted to read the other comments before leaving my review and the majority definately rules this movie is aweful from the acting to the nonrealistic animation to the countless errors i was actually hoping that the flaps would have been extended by a stretch of the imagination cannot extend flaps without engines the landing gear cannot be lowered unless you have electricity that tiny little fan that was going was not sufficient by any stretch to lower the landing gear the one thing i thought was quite peculiar is when they landed the back wheels touched down and then the nose one broke off thus suspending the plane with both back tires in the air how did the captain apply left and right brakes to tires that were not touching the ground did they forget the spoilers word to the director find out all you can about planes before attempting a plane movie sorry for the technical rant but i give this movie oneten,0
this documentary is a reenactment of the last few years of betty pagespaige richards career the tennessee tease was the most recognizable pinup queen in history her most memorable work came in the one thousand nine hundred and fiftys and was fetish photos bondage and catfight girly flicks irving klawdukey flyswatterat his movie star news instructed betty on what to do in front of the camera there was no nudity in the famous photos or stag films but nonetheless klaw was charged with distributing obscene materials and was ordered to destroy them to avoid prosecution it is no surprise that betty had a cult following at the height of her career the girlnextdoor with jet black hair blue eyes and an hour glass figure dressed in fetish gear or not would mesmerize for decades after all it has been said that she was photographed more than marilyn monroe and second only to the most photographed image in the world elvis presley betty page would disappear and devote her last years to religion this movie actually could have been a lot better but good enough to hold interestmiss richards is stunning in her own right bra panties garter belt and hose do not hurt her image in the least also in the cast jaimie henkin jana strain emily marilyn and julie simone be advised this movie can change your heart rate,0
i got to say that uma thurman is the sexiest woman on the planet this movie was uber cute and i mean uber cute it had all the sex content that most ivan reitman comedies have but with something a lil extra chemistry uma and luke both have this awkrawrd but believable chemistry that seem to transcend in each scene  both seem to create this odd twisted and interesting relationship with powerful sexual tension that you laugh until you cannot feel your face anymore anna farris and the rest of the supporting cast seem to play off each others roles perfectly and even wanda sykes rather small role will keep you laughing though these kind of comedies are not for everybody but i have to say i went with a person that does not usually enjoy these films and he was laughing like crazy this movie is certainly not for everyone especially younger children since some moments are little toowell let us say adult for younger viewers all in all i was pleasantly surprised by this movie tough the ending i found was a little weak compared to the rest of the film three onetwo out of five,1
this movie blows  let us get that straight right now there are a few scene gems nestled inside this pile of crap but none can redeem the limp plot colin farrel looks like brad pitt in twelve monkeys and acts in a similar manner i normally hate colin because he is a fairy in general but he is ok in this movie there were two plot lines in this movie one about a kid who throws rocks through windshields of moving vehicles and the other about a woman with a moustache let us face it this movie has no freaking idea of what it wanted to say or where it wanted to go the characters story lines intertwine on some levels but are in no means worthy of being included in a script the whole thing is weak and pointless and then there is an occasional ok scene but overall do not bother unless you love irish accents so much that you can watch mediocrity and it is rescued by everyone sounding like the lucky charms elf an american fetish that has catapulted some truly crappy movies to success,0
boring childrens fantasy that gives joan plowright star billing but little to do sappy kids pursue their dreams frankie wants to be a ballerina and a baseball player yuk while bestfriend hazel runs for mayorshe is thirteen totally pedestrian in every way plus the added disadvantage of syrupy performances by the girls as well as the baseball boys certainly a lesser effort for showtimeno limits,0
the threesome of bill boyd robert armstrong and james gleason play coney island carnys vying for the hand of ginger rogers a working gal who sells salt water taffy with the outbreak of world war i the threesome enlist and pursue ginger from afar the first half of this rko pathe production is hard going with the three male leads chewing up the scenery with overcooked oneliners and snappy dialogue that quickly grows tiresome the second half concentrates on action sequences as the us navy pursues both a german merchant cruiser and a youboat these sequences are lively and wellfilmed but overall this is an overlong and unsatisfying comedydrama with a flat ending for fans of the stars only,0
i usually like comedy movies i really enjoy them but i do not really get the point of envy i mean it has a dull contenttopic and it is not really funnyalthough the acting is generally good it is not enough for the movie to get at least a bit interesting stiller and black do not show all their talent in this movieso if you are about to rent a comedy i suggest you definitely do not go for this one unless you want to get bored and i can see i am not the only one with this opinion because even jack black apologized for it take a look at trivia,0
notorious for more than a quarter century and often banned it is obscurity was its greatest asset it seems hey it is often better to be talked about rather than actually seen when you cannot back the legend up with substancethe film has played in los angeles a couple of times recently and is available on home video so that veil is slowly being lifted while there is still plenty to offend the masses it is more likely to bore them than arouse much real passion except for a gratuitous and protracted xxx sex scene between a pair of horses nature documentary anyone there follows nearly an hour of a dull arranged marriage melodrama once the sex and nudity begins it is a nonstop sequence involving masturbation a looooooooong flashback to an alleged beauty and the beast encounter and a naked woman running around the mansion nobody even her supposedly protective aunt seems to even think of putting some clothes on her on video i guess you can fastforward thru the banality but it is not really worth the effort the nudity does not go beyond what is seen in something much more substantive such as bertoluccis the dreamerstry as one might to find some moral or symbolism in the carnality i doubt it is worthy of anyones effort unfortunately for la bete now that you can more easily see the film the notoriety of something once forbidden has been lifted and this beast has been tamed,0
i went to this movie at a cast and crew show because my friend whom is a producer on the movie invited me forget what you have seen in the commercials forget what you have heard go see this film for yourself i was more than surprised by it in a world of the grinch charlies angels the sixth day unbreakable here comes a film that is worth your hard earned bucks glorious scenes wonderful cinemtrophy and a cast you want to eat with your heart i found this to be one of this years most orchestrated powerhouse films and with reason robert deniro deserves an oscar nod if you could give an oscar to everyone involved as a package this would be the film,1
i enjoy quality crapness and this ranks up there with some of the finest the cg is out of this world or at least predates our world and the insanity of a six foot bloke in a rat outfit chasing after people is laughably bad i quite enjoyed some of this but the acting is so goddamn awful and even the obligatory nude scene does not really have any baps out in it just a complete waste of time if ever i saw one i do not know who wasted more time me watching this or the poor saps who got dragged into making it in the faint hope that this will launch their acting careers i can assure you it will not however on a brighter note i have managed to successfully do the six degrees of kevin bacon from this movie so i think it was almost worthwhile watching the ninetyone minutes of it,0
i have one word to someup this movie wow i saw darius goes west at the tribeca film festival people in the theater were sobbing this movie shows the hardships that darius sufferes with muscular dystrophy the movie was very well done and really made you part of the movie i was so emotionally moved by the movie because it made us remember that we are very fortunate to be perfectly healthy some people in this world are less fortuate then us and sometimes we should give them a had and help them to the very end i would give them ten stars they gave darius a had when they were not asked to they didt do it for the money they did it for a friend in need darius the world should know darius went west,1
if your idea of a thriller is car chases explosions and dozens of people being mowed down by gunfire then house of games is definitely not the movie for you if you like and appreciate psychological drama and suspense then by all means see ithouse of games tells the story of an esteemed psychologist and writer dr margaret ford lindsay crouse who tries to help a patient and gets involved in the shadowy world of con men led by the charismatic mike joe mantegna to say anything more about the plot would ruin the suspense frankly i find it hard to believe anyone who says they saw the twists coming just like a clever con artist this movie draws you into its web and lulls your vigilancethe story is taut and wellcrafted the dialogue smart and laconic the acting uniformly good mantegna is superbly charismatic some have complained that dr ford is not a very sympathetic character and wondered why mamet would make lindsay crouse look so physically unattractive but dr ford is supposed to be cold and aloof moreover her homeliness is in a way essential to the plot at one point i believe that an injury to her sexual selfesteem is a key part of her motivation  i will say no morehouse of games is a dark look at the underside of human nature that concludes on a note of discomforting ambiguity it will hold your attention every second while you are watching and stay with you for a long time afterwards,1
i really cannot believe this movie is not in the imdb worst two hundred and fifty it is absolutely terrible when i originally saw it i remember talking about it in a college class and two other people had also seen it we were all telling other class members not to see it because it was so horrible by the time we were done some others wanted to see it just because they could not believe anything was as bad as we were saying it was do not be like them just pass this by i am sure everyone involved with this movie would also prefer you never see them in this movie,0
along with it is partner this is the greatest piece of animation ever created the images and styles are amazing and match perfectly with the story which is a brilliantly realistic reinterpretation of our own world where is has been and where it could go quite affecting and sometimes painful to watch it it a masterpiece of the visual art,1
i would heard of eddie izzard but had never seen him in action i knew he was a transvestite and when i saw he was on hbo one night last summer i put it on not knowing how my husband would react well he blew us away he is better than robin williams ever was he has total control of the audience when he does the englebert is dead  no he is not routine the audience does not know what to think by the end god as james mason is also an inspired touch and his version of the python spanish inquisition as carried out by the church of england  cake or death is priceless my jaws were aching from laughter by the end of the show we scoured the tv listings for months after that to be able to see him again and were lucky enough to tape him the next time he came on if you get the chance to see this show cancel everything and tape it you will not be disappointed,1
a great funny sweet movie with morgan freeman who plays himself and who meets a spanish girl named scarlet paz vega at a small store whilst researching a potential independent film i was a bit dubious about the film for the first ten minutes but as soon as he was in the store i really started to enjoy the film it shows how a positive attitude can change anything it does not contain any complex plots and it is easy to follow but will lift the saddest of moods and make you smile all the way through without the need for petty cliché romance it includes several scenes all the way through which make you clutch your sides with laughter a very rare masterpiece,1
my observations postwar hilarity tom drake and grandpa from meet me in st louis two years later the year i was born donna reed charming and pretty margaret hamilton good as always smaller part than in wizard of oz spring byington way prettier also with the prerequisite perky small nose lacked by hamilton tent scene at end with former boy next door was hilarious as a two year veteran of army tents he looked pretty youthful and inexperienced when i looked into his eyesi used to work in a department store and it was just as elegant as this one sadly it has disappeared and faded into obscurity we were famous for those great show windows that were used to lure passersby into the store to get them to buy all of that wonderful merchandisetenten,1
as with all environmentally aware films from the one thousand nine hundred and seventys soylent green has a rather cheesy view of what ecological meltdown is  overpopulation means theres too many people to feed  i was under the impression that famines were caused by either war or failed economic policies  stalins policy in the soviet union in the one thousand nine hundred and thirtys left millions dead because of famine and to this day the greatest man made tragedy was maos rural policy in china which led over thirty million starvation deaths in the one thousand nine hundred and fiftys  and lets not forget the great famines in the horn of africa in the one thousand nine hundred and eightys and ninetys which were to do with conflicts not overpopulation  you might like to also consider that two of the most heavily populated areas on earth  hong kong and macau  have never suffered a famine in modern times  likewise the expansion of shanty towns around cities as seen here isnt strictly down to overpopulation  its down to economic factors where people flock to cities to find better paid work than in the countryside  its a symptom of industrial progress  not of too many births  so the image of the streets of new york city being too congested to walk through and of having people sleep in stairwells is somewhat laughablebut dont be fooled into thinking soylent green is a pile of corny tree hugging crap because i consider this to be the best ecological film of theseventys  it plays on the contempary audiences knowledge of the world where sol and thorn are beside themselves with joy at finding fruit  brandy and fresh meat  thorn gasps in amazement at having ice in his whisky  puffs on a cigarette and delivers the classic line  if i could afford it id smoke two  maybe three of these a day   but its the visage of the euthanasia chamber thats memorable as thorn gazes at the images of wild animals  flowers  running water and snow covered mountains  a world thorns generation has never known  this is a very haunting scene which makes soylent green a very memorable film  combined with the fact it features the final screen appearance of edward g robinson as the wise old jew sol roth,1
okay it seems like so far only the barman fans have commented on this film  time for a counterpoint beware this writeup is longfor those not in the knowing mostly the nonbelgians  tom barman director of this film is the frontman of deus one of the better known rock bands of the late ninetys here in belgium basically they made a couple of very adventurous and innovative albums and quickly rose to fame on the national scale then egos started hurting and the band basically fell apart with barman and a couple of others remaining to go on making albums under the deusmonicker the way it always happens in such cases the postbreakdown deus was a lot tamer and less interesting than the original they tried to go for an international breakthrough with their album the ideal crash in one thousand nine hundred and ninetynine presenting a much diluted form of their earlier style of songwriting they did not quite make it however egos were still pretty big it seems  big enough for barman to consider himself enough of an artist to try on moviesmore often than not this sort of thing is a very big mistake and this film does not make the exception and barman clearly went for art on this one another very big mistake for one thing he is a musician not a movie director for another deus at it is best made fun and provoking music but never anything close to what i would consider art it showsso what is this movie about basically it tells the story of a bunch of completely uninteresting people doing equally uninteresting things over the course of a totally uninteresting friday in antwerp as even more uninteresting stuff happens to them in the act of being uninteresting the characters are shallow the plot totally pointless and the film just does not have any other redeeming qualities to make up for these shortcomings humor the whole film made me smile slightly about three times and actually managed to provoke a single fivesecond laugh not quite loud mood the film just does not seem to show any kind of emotion or feeling at all mystery well minor spoilerthe idea of the windman inspiring the name of the film is as enthralling as a banana pepper pizza  not very and has been done a thousand times before anyone remember johny destiny  one of tarantinos worst appearances on film to dateend minor spoiler and well its artistic so do not expect any kind of real action to make up for all the previous in other words except for the few smiles it bored me out of my shortsso what remains well the soundtrack is pretty good though it suffers from some of the same problems that other osts have shown lately  first it makes the movie seem like nothing more than a commercial for the cd second it gives the impression that barman is trying to hide the weaknesses and lack of emotional content in the film behind the content quality of the songs which simply does not work in the end it makes the film look like nothing more than an illustration to the songs and sadly it is barmans own contribution to the soundtrack which gets the most attention though it is the weakest part of the whole soundtrack as far as i am concerned all in all it just stands to show that barman knows more about music than movies camera work is okay as well though not anything that would make you scream out with joythe only thing about this movie that kept me watching was the sightseeing factor since i originate from antwerp it was fun to play a kind of guessthelocation game i would hardly consider this as a quality thoughall in all another chance lost for flemmish film i keep on noticing that lately the best belgian movies have been coming from the french part of the country this is mostly because at least they have something to tell and manage to tell it in way that is both sharp and emotional the brothers daerden come to mind maybe the flemmish arthouse filmmakers should try that too,0
man has been to the farthest reaches of the earth and now he is traveling to new worlds but with new worlds come ancient evils the vampires of space and not just a handful but entire tribes in this film which i saw as bloodsuckers but i guess also goes as vampires wars we see what happens when the imperialist earthlings meet the imperialist vampiresi will make this review very short because it is undeserving of a good review the best i can say for this film is it has a good cast of blist and upcoming stars natassia malthe was quintana and was far more attractive here than in bloodrayne two michael ironside is muco and is always a fan favorite as i say he is the poor mans jack nicholson and we even get carrieann fleming as damians wife who horror fans will now recognize as the eponymous jenifer from dario argentos jenifer so this movie as bad as it is is not without some names attached but the same can be said of uwe bolls workthe concept of the military tracking and killing vampires in space is not necessarily a bad idea but it easily falls into the realm of cheese and this film falls hard the acting especially from the vampires is over the top and i just did not find the explanations of their existence very convincing worst of all the vampire tribes have the names voorhess and leatherfaces i understand this was supposed to be a clever reference for the horror fans but it was not clever at all it just sounded dumb and out of place unlike the much more subtle references in james gunns slither such as naming stores after lesserknown horror directorsthat is all i want to say if you can stand lots of cheese on this day i could not and i am from wisconsin and want to see average actors with poor costumes fight vampires in space although space looks a lot like any other forest on earth check this one out if you can find it i do not personally recommend this when you can watch other cheesy vampires films jon carpenters vampires or other cheesy space movies or maybe even some good ones but hey do your thing,0
i think that deep down in the darkest slimiest part of their heart everyone likes jerry springer just a little bit while his show is undeniably offensive and stupid it also gives us a chance to see that relatively speaking most of us have it real good when you look at the trailer park livin dollar whiskey drinkin incest loving people on the springer show it makes even your worst day seem like a walk in the park jerry is performing a public service and we should be grateful he ditched a political career to host the show just for uswhat we should not be grateful for in any way is the piece of garbage movie ringmaster ringmaster shows what life is like for people who wind up being guests on the show or so they would like us to think the movie follows the prerequisite springer story line love triangles one triangle involves connie her daughter angel and her husband rusty the other involves starletta vonda and demond when the two hapless groups meet up in la their lives intertwine and collide headon all culminating in an explosive episode of the springer show it is like what short cuts would be if robert altman had had a severe crack habitringmaster is true to the show as it is stupid and offensive from start to finish it also makes me very glad that i do not live in the squalor it is characters do but the movie has a problem it is billed as a comedy but it just is not very funny what laughs there are to be had are few and far between maybe some people watch this and laugh nonstop if you think blow jobs and rape are funny well then i guess you are one of those folks personally i laughed two or three times and spent the rest of the movie in utter awe of the agonizing horrors of whitetrash lifethe jerry springer show just is not meant to make the leap from tv to the silver screen what is funny in an hour long show less when you count commercials is not necessarily going to be funny in a ninety minute movie movies have to tell a story and that is something else ringmaster has trouble with the story is threadbare there are so many plot holes and continuity errors that any attempt at telling a cohesive narrative is quickly put asunder and even if there were not such problems how much fun can you pull out of a story of stereotypical people in a stereotypical story even the hollywood formula could not make this better ringmaster is so bad it even screws up the best part of the springer show the final thought somehow even the smartest and simplest aspect of the show wound up blowing harder than the slutty women the film is built aroundthe worst offender in all of this is springer himself he is such a bad actor that he cannot even play himself convincingly watching springer play springer is sad it is like he was going for a what if woody allen played jerry springer vibe and he failed miserably he went to the trouble of producing this disaster the least he could do is try to make it just that much betternot that i am saying everyone else in this movie put in an award worthy performance just the opposite they all suck not so surprisingly no one in this movie went on to greatness the best any of them was did was molly hagan landing a job on a nickelodeon sitcom apparently nickelodeon has no problem with hiring a woman who starred in the most vile film of the ninetys to star in a childrens program it makes you wonder what kind of things the other adults on that channel have done in their pastshere are my final thoughts what we have here is a group of people with no self respect and a man with money to burn who have met and put their resources together to produce a film that shows how much they hate themselves and how little they think of the intelligence of their viewing audience should we accept people who make movies that treat us like severely braindamaged lumps of goo i say no somewhere out there in this crazy mixed up world there is a perfect movie for each of us we just have to keep looking for it until next time take care of yourselves and your loved ones and do not ever watch ringmaster,0
very very humdrum movie fare here with stella stevens taking directions from someone in disguiseit did not take me long to guess who it was in old nevada town outside vegas for a money heist in the circus circus hotel in las vegas stevens leads her girl gang of three and they find out that they must act much quicker than had been anticipated despite some neat looks at las vegas in the seventys very average yet credible acting from most involved and a plot line with potential las vegas lady lays one big boring egg it seems forever for the film to kick into gearand when it does it just sputters here and there and never really speeds up i was somewhat disappointed with this film sure i was not expecting anything great but i at least thought this might be one of those neat exploitation films from the seventys or something like it not even close no one dies there is a lame gunfight between creaky stuart whitman and officious george dicenzo one year prior to his grand performance as the prosecuting attorney bugliosa in helter skelter the gunfight has all the suspense of watching a waterfall there is one punch and one head hit with a blunt instrument beyond that nothing in terms of action and as for the girls do not expect much there either stella and her girlsboth very mediocre yet pretty talents get in a sauna and a bath what do we see nothing but a fleeting side profile stella wears these nice open blouses accentuating her real talents but i wish she would have been a bit more open with her performance that way i could write one thing that would recommend the film alas it was not to be and i have little to say in this films favor it is not a horrible film in any way it just has nothing going for it either yawn,0
a matter of life and death what can you really say that would properly do justice to the genius and beauty of this film powell and pressburgers visual imagination knows no bounds every frame is filled with fantastically bold compositions the switches between the bold colours of the real world to the stark black and white of heaven is ingenious showing us visually just how much more vibrant life is the final court scene is also fantastic as the judge and jury descend the stairway to heaven to hold court over peter david nivens operation all of the performances are spot on roger livesey being a standout and the romantic energy of the film is beautiful never has there been a more romantic film than this if there has i have not seen it a matter of life and death is all about the power of love and just how important life is and jack cardiffs cinematography is reason enough to watch the film alone the way he lights kim hunters face makes her all the more beautiful what a genius he can make a simple things such as a game of table tennis look exciting and the sound design is also impeccable the way the sound mutes at vital points was a decision way ahead of its timethis is a true classic that can restore anyones faith in cinema under appreciated on its initial release and by todays audiences but one of my all time favourites which is why i give this film a tenten in a word  beautiful,1
a bus full of passengers is stuck during a snow storm the police have closed the bridgesaying it is unsafe and they are stuck in a little café until the road has been cleared however after a while their boredom is turned to concern as it seems that one of the passengers was not originally on the bus and may just be an alien this leads to a conclusion that is ironic but also rather funny in a lowbrow waythis is another of the fun episodes of the twilight zone instead of the typical twists or social commentary this one features no lasting message however it is also very and watchable so who cares exactly what occurs you will just have to see for yourselfby the way this one stars john hoyta face most of you will recognize from countless old tv shows and movies in almost every case he played a real grouch like charles lane during the same era but boy did i love seeing himas he perfected the grouchy persona and was kind of funny at the same time,1
i recently found a copy for five at a video store and snapped it up eagerly while the music and obviously graphics are not up to the standards of my favorite of the series beyond the minds eye i am still entranced by one segmentstanley and stella in breaking the ice the music is brilliant and the emotions feel real the clip on odysseys website does not have the story nor the music unfortunately,1
while i watched this movie i tried to figure out why they bothered making it though the main plot of the movie is potentially good there are all sorts of unrelatedunnecessary subplots the marketing people in hollywood must have dictated the multiple bad guys perpetual doublecrosses and the man and woman who get too close and have sex it is odd that we see more of them having sex than we did of the president and his mistress the many plots and subplots make the film too broad and none of the characters are properly developed  i really did not feel like i knew any character except that everyone is corrupt and evil the ending is totally incomplete  it left me more than just wanting what might have been but what was supposed to be in the end there is really no explanation of why anyone does what they do except to serve as additional corrupt characters who commit a doublecross i am surprised that so many established and good actors agreed to make such a hollow movie this seemed like a movie made by college students who are working on their twond or threerd projectdo not waste your time unless you are in a film class and want an example of what not to do when making a movie,0
here is a movie with a good cast and nice looking location work but it just do not have it director richard brooks must have been a little bit tired at this stage of the game how much better his the professionals was the horses and the rest of the action seemed to be in slow motion even during the nonslow motion scenes this film needed to be spedup if anything that horse lather sure looked awful phony to me and the obvious tire tracks in those desert tracking moments just lazy sloppy work too bad the actors did ok but i have certainly seen all of them do better ben johnsons always a joy though i first saw this flick almost thirty years ago was disappointed then and remained so upon second viewing thirty years later,0
a truly horrible film that left me feeling sullied by having watched the forty minutes or so i could stand not the actors fault but the writerdirector producers financiers etc need a very stiff talking to maybe it thinks it is profound it is not this rape and ultraviolence unlike that central to clockwork orange has nothing to say about or add to the sum of human understanding it is no straw dogs either to which i have seen it compared rather it feels like something pete walker might have turned his hand to yet even in saying that i am probably being a bit unfair on pete walkerrevenge is a powerful human desire but the bedroom window has more to say about that and male emasculation than this pitiful efforti do not think it is particularly misogynistic merely too gleeful in its depiction of certain details  the blood running down gas leg post rape par example it is neither challenging nor confrontational though i am sure the filmmakers consider themselves very daring just deeply unpleasantis this as high as we can aim is this why those involved wanted to make films  i did write in here the latin phrase which translates as oh the times oh the customs but the new spellcheck on imdb would not let me post until i had removed it likewise i had to remove square parentheses get it sorted imdbwhere is the lofty aspiration the noble impulse when you look at british film  the joyful comedies of ealing or the boulting brothers carol reeds work with graham greene on fallen idol our man in havana or the sublime the third man a film which has far more to say about evil than a thousand straightheads the work of powell  pressburger or if you want to talk about sex violence and male emasculation look at the offence dir sidney lumet from an original play by john hopkins check out tunes of glory for something worth making that has something to sayunlike the foregoing straightheads is alas an altogether hateful waste of celluloid,0
i am writing this after just seeing the perfect son at the two thousand and two gay and lesbian mardi gras film festival in sydney australiawhen their father dies two estranged brothers meet at the funeral and after discovering that one of the brothers is dying from aids they enter on a heart warming journey of reconciliation the two leads do a magnificent job of creating the gradual warmth and respect that builds up between them as the movie progresses i do have one qualm about the movie though  whilst the brother who is dying acts sick he does not look it a person of zero tfour cells would look quite ill  not even a make up job to make the actor look ill was employed a small gripe but one that makes it a bit less realistic despite that one small gripe the perfect son is a wonderful movie and should you have the chance to see it do i am hoping for a dvd release in the near future,1
what the heck was this somebody obviously read stephen king and sartre in the same semester we get existential angst mixed in with cheap horror there were moments that were disturbing but each one was canceled out by horrible music cgi or actingthe problem with weird narratives like this is that it feels lazy even david lynchs work feels like that at times and just like his interesting shows and movies it runs far far too long and sadly this is only ninetyeight minutesthe cast was attractive and that is about the limit to this i suppose it touches on feelings of adolescents and the fear of loneliness we all have but just does not make the characters likable enough for us to care about their fateswhatever they were the final scene leaves the whole thing ambiguous,0
all right i recently got a chance to rent this and watch santa claus conquers the martains although the children were much more sadistic in scctm i would have to say that santa claus was a much worse movie as a spanish assignment in spanish five we all had to watch it i will tell you usually when we watch a movie we are all just talking and eating food but not for this movie everyone just kept there jaw open wondering what the evil mr pitch was going to do next would merlin help santa claus or would his robot reindeer come and save the day i would suggest renting it because it is the biggest piece of rubbish i have ever seen and i love it for that d,0
one of the best movies for all ages you will never be able to look at lion king again without thinking of the extra history this movie adds nearly forty years old i watched this with my wife and two sons after work tonight  i have not laughed  enjoyed a movie so much in a long timetake time out and watch this with the kids it will remind you of how disney used to be when you were a young one,1
i am a big fan of fred macmurray and carole lombard and in addition to them charles butterworth a very enjoyable supporting actor was in this filmso why did not i particularly enjoy it well despite a good cast this is one of the poorest written and most clichéd a pictures i have ever seen given the talent and money spent to make this film it is shocking how slipshod the writing was i knew the film would be tedious when time after time early in the film i found myself predicting exactly what would happen nextand i was always right and this is not because i am some sort of movie savant but was because almost no imagination or effort went into it in fact it seemed almost as if the film was just a long string of clichés all strung together also i found it a bit irritating that fred mistreated carole so bad throughout the film and yet true to convention she came running to him in the end uggh there is more suspense in a lassie film will he bring people to rescue timmy or will the rope he is dangling from breakdespite the very very tired and clichéd script there were a few positives about the film it was pretty cool seeing fred look like a broken lush at the end of the filmit was pretty believable and he looked like he had not eaten shaved or slept in days also charles butterworths prattle did provide a few mildly humorous moments but all this just was not enough to make this film look any different than a b movie it is a shameit could have been so much better,0
i have been watching this movie by hoping to find a pretty and interesting story yet the story line was not good at all the play of the actors were not any betterof course shahrukh khan was there yet he was not enough to make this movie credible and interestingi have read that this movie was based on the novel of flaubert madame bovary yet for me i did not see it matching with the indian mentalityin general we buy movie to dream and have a good time not to waste our time and change our mood into worse i just cannot understand how it could get such a high vote with an average of sixeighttenso it is the kind of movie you should run away  ignore because there is nothing to appreciate in it you will just waste your time unless if you like dark movie with strange and non sense story,0
i was not really hoping for much when i went to see this after mstthreeking the heck out of jasonx with some friends though i was hoping for a similar experience hereunfortunately the movie took itself way too seriously do i care about jasons problems i am sorry no there are a legion ftthirteenth movies that cover that anyway at at then end of the day he is an undead serial killer i am just not going to get that sympatheticfreddy was by far the most interesting aspect of the movie with the hallucinations and what not but unfortunately they were few and far between and by the end of the movie it had degenerated into a bad episode of celebrity deathmatchonly not funny,0
on the night of his bachelor party paul coleman jason lee meets the gorgeous dancer becky julia stiles in the bar they drink a lot together and in the next morning he wakes up with her on the bed his future motherinlaw calls him and informs that his fiancée karen selma blair might be arriving in his apartment and he desperately asks becky to leave his place in a hurry sooner he finds that her has crabs and later in the preparation of his wedding dinner party he realizes that becky is the cousin of karen this is the beginning of a very funny comedy with hilarious situations the first attraction of this movie certainly is the central trio of actresses and actor julia stiles and selma blair who are excellent actresses and extremely gorgeous and jason lee who is amazingly funny have good performances i laughed a lot along the story but there are some scenes that are really hilarious for example when paul finds becky in his bed when he finds her paints his imagination in many situations in the drugstore trying to buy and get explanations about the crab medicine most of the scenes of his neighbor the minister when karen calls the department store or when the police finds a suspect of assaulting paul i could number many other scenes but better off the reader rent or buy this movie and have lots of fun my vote is seventitle brazillouco por elas crazy for them,1
when i first saw a small scene of it in some announcements i thought the show would be entertaining to watch the little robot guy does look kind of cute the style of animation does look sort of familiar to some classic shows before the show aired i studied it through some sources there i did became slightly dismayed the three children tommy gus and lola are voiced appropriately but robotboy is an exception it would have been a lot nicer if he were to be portrayed by a young lad one good example is robot jones a robot character from whatever happened to robot jones the show is not bad really but the way robotboy is inappropriately portrayed is my only criticism thus i do not watch it much,0
sick really stands for so incredibly crappy i killed myself there was absolutely no acting to speak of the best part of the whole production was the art work on the cover of the boxthe budgeting of this movie was sufficient the filming was sub sesame street the production looks like that of the underground filming for mob hits the props used in this movie were stolen from a clothing store the ending was so predictable you should fast forward to the last five minutes and laugh if there is a book out there for this movie i am sure it is better i would avoid this at all costs i did enjoy the intimate scenes they made the whole movie worth it just kidding,0
i have always liked spike lees movies but this one was a total waste of two onetwo hours i expected more about son of sam and instead got a movie that seemed to have very little to do with the one thousand nine hundred and seventyseven serial killings the talking dog was laughable you know you are in trouble when all the movie patrons burst into laughter inappropriately the whole movie seemed very disjointed and not very interesting the sex scenes were totally irrelevent to the plot i am not opposed to sex in movies but it should have some point unless it is a xxx movie all in all we were very disappointed at this spike lee effort,0
if this is all the watchowskis have to offer in terms of a back story to the matrix than i really have to question the claims of all of the fans who believe that the movies are intended to register on a deeper level the second renaissance while visually stunning  beautiful is storywise cliched  ludicrous how many times have we heard the story of humans relying too much on technology humans alltoo eager to make war humans basically destroying themselves there is nothing new here and i have another question considering the plot of the second renaissance does not that make the machines the good guys the machines are oppressed for generations by their cruel human overmasters they fight back win their freedom and seek to establish a peaceful harmonious coexistence with the humans who reject them in favor of allout war which the cleverer machines naturally win if this is the backstory then we should not be rooting for neo we should be rooting for the machines the humans were cruel and oppressive while the machines were courageous and attepted to be compassionate since i do not believe that the watchowskis intend for us to favor the machines over the humans i have to believe that the second renaissance was simply a misguided attempt  creating a backstory,0
this is a movie that is bad in every imaginable way sure we like to know what happened twelve years from the last movie and it works on some level but the new characters are just not interesting baby melody is hideously horrible alas while the logic that humans cannot stay underwater forever is maintained other basic physical logic are ignored it is chilly if you do not have cold weather garments if you are in the arctic i do not know why most comments here return of jafar rates worse i thought this one is more horrible,0
its time to pay tribute to the great charton heston after his recent passing but this film is not the one his other films of a past generation were ben hur the ten commandents omega man and planet of the apes were his better worksthis film made in one thousand nine hundred and seventythree attempts to prophesies a future earth  in two thousand and twentytwo that is so overpopulated that the human race has been manipulated by authorities to eat a universally produced food product called soylent green which is manufactured with human flesh this bizarre and implausible film was as ridiculous at the time of its release as it is now and assumes indias population which would be about two billion by that stage would be then meat eaters without knowing itcharlton hestons character this supers secret international conspiracy that world powers have concocted to meet the nutritional demands of overpopulation by using cannibalismunfortunately for the producers of this film the green message they deliver is not the greens party of todays ethos thank god cannibalism was practiced by the indigenous populations in new zealand  fiji and borneo up until only forty years before this film was made but has been long abandoned by human civilizationanother silly prediction in the film is that women become quasi sex slaves turning back the tide of radical feminism which was on the rise in one thousand nine hundred and seventytwo when this film was madethe film was stupid then and is as silly now but does contain a very unmemorable last film performance by the late and great edward g robinson but still no a valid reason to revisit the film other than for academic reasonsthis is a dud of a film and i would not even recommend it to baby boomers or charlton heston fans all the other reviews of this film i have read all sound the same referring to a dystopian society in the future of which the centralised theme only seems to involve the usa in which an ecological disaster has occurredthe only merit in the film is that earth does face overpopulation,1
i was looking forward to seeing amanda peet in another good role after recently renting the whole nine yardseasily worth the rental by the waybut this was not iti remembered that the trailer for whipped was somewhat funny and the plot about three oversexed new yorker twenty something is all falling for and getting manipulated by the charming ms peet was worth a shot so i convinced two friends one afternoon to come see this movie with me this review is my penancein the first act we have the three lead studs recounting their conquests in a diner what should have been funny or at least telling comes out rather pathetic was there any redeeming quality about the three men and their encounters that we were supposed to get out of thisand while i do not mind movies that are cheerfully vulgar i kept wondering why no one in the diner turned around when the studs talk loudly about sexual and scatalogical details they do this every week at the same diner you would think someone would complain oh wait i forgot two other diners do notice in one scene but this is just a setup for a punchline everyone else in the diner is deafthe second act has the three studs all falling for mia and then developing brain rot failing to ask each other or her about what is really happening between the four of them and i kept asking myself as the studs keep acting like they have been what redeeming qualities does she see in them to stick with them longer than one date does she start out with brain rot i kept hoping for erics character the married buddy to become something more than simply the annoying punching bag in this act his role is clearly to dispense advice on being married but why do they even bother to talk to him when they will not talk to each other and his advice sheeeshthe third act resolves what plot there is but by this time i was looking at my watch my friends told me they were still waiting for something genuinely funny to happen and i had to agree the scene that explains all was adequate and managed to explain all of the questions and mysterious dialogue bits throughout the movie but we were just checking them off a list oh okay that is why brad had that happen and jonathan says this andwhat laughs we made were from the stupidity of the plot than at anything amusing even the outtakes during the credits were not very funny ultimately i was left with nothing except a desire to warn people away from this movierating three,0
this movie has taken a lot of stick it was slated by critics when it came out and was blamed for wrecking nicolas cages career the thing i do not think people get is that it is not meant to be an epic oscar contender of a movie it is just some brilliant bruckbuster action at its best fast cars quick editing and a great soundtrack  it does exactly what it says on the tin also for anyone who likes cars its a pure treat it has everything ferraris mercs a hummer and let us not forget eleanor i think you would be hard pushed to find a better action movie and personally a better movie at all then again maybe that is just me,1
it was pointed out in a now deleted post from another imdb user that anyone who might see the medusa touch should be warned about a scene that is eerily reminiscent of the sept eleven two thousand and one terrorist attacks in nyc but i hope anyone reading this will consider this warning despite an interesting pedigree producer elliott kastner produced harper and the long goodbye coproducer arnon milchan coproduced the oscarnominated la confidential and screenwriter john briley won an oscar for gandhi and an international cast i found the medusa touch to be a heavyhanded unintentional laugh riot it was a poorly directed horribly written and acted mess it tried to capitalize on the seventys telekinetic thrillers genre the movie fails on many counts please consider carrie and the underrated the fury both directed by brian depalma they were two entertaining and exciting thrillers that dealt with the same subject matter,0
the blob starts with one of the most bizarre theme songs ever sung by an uncredited burt bacharach of all people you really have to hear it to believe it the blob may be worth watching just for this song alone  my user comment summary is just a little taste of the classy lyrics after this unnerving opening credits sequence the blob introduces us the viewer that is to steve andrews steve mcqueen as steven mcqueen  his girlfriend jane martin aneta corsaut who are parked on their own somewhere  witness what looks like a meteorite falling to earth in nearby woods an old man olin howland as olin howlin who lives in a cabin also sees it  goes to investigate he finds a crater  a strange football sized rock which splits open when he unwisely pokes it with a stick laying in the centre of the meteorite is a strange jelly like substance which sticks to the stick if you know what i mean it then slides up the stick  attachés itself to the old mans hand meanwhile steve  jane are quietly driving along minding their own business when the old man runs out in front of steves car steve being a decent kind of guy decides to take the old man to dr t hallan alden stephen chase as steven chase at the local surgery dr hallan says he does not know what the substance on the old mans hand is but it is getting bigger  asks steve to go back where he found him  see if he can find out what happened steve agrees but does not come up with anything  upon returning to dr hallans surgery he witnesses the blob devouring him the towns police lieutenant dave earl rowe  the teenage hating sergeant jim bert john benson unsurprisingly do not believe a word of it  end up suspecting steve  his mates al anthony franke tony robert fields  someone called mooch miller james bonnet of playing an elaborate practical joke on the police department however as the blob continues to eat it is way through the town steve sets about finding proof of it is existence  convincing the police about the threat it posses not just to their town but the entire worlddirected irvin s yeaworth jr  an uncredited russell s doughton jr i was throughly disappointed by this the original one thousand nine hundred and fiftyeight version of the blob the script by kay linaker as kate phillips  theodore simonson is an absolute bore  extremely dull not making the most of it is strongest aspects the blob focuses on the tiresome dramatics  conflicts between the teenagers  police in fact the majority of the blob is spent on steve trying to convince the police of the blobs existence for most of the film the blob itself almost seems inconsequential  somewhat forgotten it only has two or three scenes for the fist hour  a bit until the less than exciting climax when the adults  teenagers have to work together to defeat the blob  have a new found appreciation of each other afterwards yuck why could not the blob just eat the lot of them no explanation is given for what the blob is or it is origins other than it came from space how long did it take them to come up with that the dialogue is clunky  silly as well as are peoples actions  decision making i love the part when a nurse named kate lee paton as lee payton did anyone use their real name in this thing is confronted by the blob she throws some acid over it  calmly proclaims doctor nothing will stop it how does she know nothing will stop it exactly there is no blood or violence so do not worry about that the special effects on the blob itself are not too bad considering but it barely has any screen time  moves very slowly a bit like the film in general actually the acting is terrible mcqueen is supposed to be a teenager when in reality he was twentyeight years old  it shows he looks old enough to be his own dad same thing goes for most of the other teenage cast members  everyone generally speaking are wooden  unconvincing in their roles technically the blob is very basic dark static photography dull direction  forgettable production values the blob is one of those films that probably sounds good on paper  is well known as being a classic but is in actual fact a huge disappointment when finally seen this is one case when the remake the blob one thousand nine hundred and eightyeight is definitely better than the original the original blob is slow  boring  the remake is not the original blob contains no blood or gore  the remake does the original blob has incredibly poor acting  casting decisions  the remake does not  the original blob itself gets very little screen time eating only three or four people throughout the entire film  the remake features the blob all the way through  it virtually eats an entire town the choice is an easy one the remake every time as it is a better film in every respect i will give the film two stars  give that wonderful main theme song one on it is own definitely not the classic many seem to make out,0
one wonders why this picture was made at all  the plot as such is totally unbelievable if not ridiculous the characters experienced loner cop versus younger one quite fascinated quite predictable the ending totally murky and impossible to understand maybe after several viewings but you would have to have a masochistic tendency for that  the idea being you have to read the book to understand fully what it is all aboutand the acting is bad was the basic idea to show that french film makers are able to do as well as americans in the genre that include seven and silence of the lambs  if so it is a total failure it was quite a success though and has a sort of cultstatus as the first french serial killer filmand it seems considered as a good product to export strange,0
no reason to bother renting this flick from the opening credits on i knew i was in troubleit was filmed as though it was a soft porn movie but there really is not anything erotic about it the look into the world of sex addiction is intriguing but only to a pointboring sex scenes bad plot and cameos by ed begley jr and rosanna arquette are not enough to save this film,0
this movie is truly boring it was banned in chinese cinema and i can see why it is not because it is critical of the communist regime but simply because the movie is of such low quality i would never want to pay money to watch this i love movies from chen kaige and zhang yimou and i am disappointed such a poor movie could come out of china it totally seems to ignore the audience and the director seems to have made the movie for himself the shots of a person standing there doing nothing for up to a minute are hilarious and there is plenty of them the cinematography and video quality are unbelievably bad i looked this film up on the net and it seems like people actually like this film the only explanation i have for this is that some film buffs think that if a film is not in english it is automatically good i cannot see any reason why people would like this this is not an art film it is of waste of celluloidthat is if they actually shot it on film  which they did not,0
a plot that fizzled and reeked of irreconcilable differences in opinions constituted a judgmental havoc with one side prolife and the other a destroyer of a demons seed the horror was left out and replaced with an overall dull effect quite possibly meant to be horrific but instead demonstrated an ill dose of beliefs which ridiculed each other to death despite the title itself being a fan of masters of horror since the beginning this ridiculous plot twist with it is sordid depictions crashed apart like a spindly old rocking chair after being sat upon i view this episode as being thrown together from the get go never really taking off anywhere other than to see it through for what its worth and relieved when it finally came to the end,0
watching john cassavetes film opening night i was reminded of something that quentin tarantino said once in an interview about personal experience in being a creator of art or acting he referred to an example of say if he ran over a dog while on his way to act in a play that it would not be the end of his life but that it would affect him and that without a doubt he would have to bring that experience with him on stage even if it was a light comedy otherwise as he said what am i doing i could not help but think of his words when watching gena rowlands character myrtle gordon who for almost a whole week or so goes through a very similar scenario there is more to this in cassavetes film of course since it is about how the theater works around a star actress what emotion and human nature mean when looking at playing a character and how one lives when all one has like myrtle gordon is the theaternear the beginning of the film after exiting a performance myrtle is signing autographs and one such fan named nancy comes up to her favorite star and pours her heart out to myrtle it is a touching little moment but it does not last as she has to get in the car pouring rain and all she then watches in horror as the girl who stood right next to the car as it drove off gets hit by another car in an auto accident she is not sure really what happened but then finds out the next day that in fact the girl did die from the hit from then on she is sort of stunned by this even after she thinks it is out of her system at first this shows in small ways like when she rehearses a scene with her fellow actor played by cassavetes and cannot seem to stand being hit  she blames it on the lack of depth in the character the writer what do you think the play lacks hope says myrtle but then nancy starts to show up to her an apparition that to myrtle is all to real until she is suddenly gonecassavetes as in the past films is after a search for what it means to have emotion to really feel about something and feel it or the lack thereof and how it affects others around the person this is not exactly new ground for rowlands who previously played a woman on the edge of herself in woman under the influence in that case because of alcohol nor would it be alien territory for costar ben gazzara who just came off starring in killing of a chinese bookie but the actors express everything essential to their characters in every scene cassavetes does not tell them how to get from a to b in a scene and he does not need to there is a mood in a cassavetes film that trumps the sometimes grungy camerawork you know myrtle for example should be content somehow even if it is not with the plot but she is haunted and is unsatisfied with her characters lack of depth and the tone of the play aging who goes to see that she asks the playwright and it starts to affect those around her toothe question soon becomes though not what is the usual a conventional dramatist would make the conflict will she be able to go on stage will the show go on this is not important for cassavetes even if it is there as is the question will she be alright perhaps going through such a grueling play as the second woman could help her work out her personal demons and her losing her grip on reality seeing sara and attacking her in front of total strangers who wonder what the hell is going on or will the plays lack of hope strain everything else wrong with her the depths rowlands makes with her character are intense and harrowing and that it is expected does not mean it is any duller than woman under the influence if anything it is just as good as that film at being honest about a person in this profession and consequently the other performances are just as true from gazarra to nancy played by a subtle laura johnson cassavetes answers to his own posed questions are not easyone of the real thrills of opening night along with seeing great actors performing an amazing script is to see cassavetes take on the theater the way he does we see the play performed and it is apparently a real play and we only know slightly what it is about when we see the actors on the stage performing it we wax and wane between being involved in what melodrama is going on relationship scuffling and affairs and the occasional slap and domestic violence and the improvisation of the actors i wondered watching how much really was improvised how much cassavetes allowed for the other actors to do in the scenes where myrtle starts to go loopy or in the climax is completely smashed he is on the stage too so it must have been something for them to work it out beforehand and let what would happen happenit is funny startling chilling and edgeofyourseat stuff some of the best theateronfilm scenes ever put in a movie and we see the lines between actor on stage actor on film actor with actor blur together wonderfully opening night is a potent drama that is full of frank talk about death and madness reality and fiction where the love is between people and really finally what does acting mean,1
the power of kangwon province is director hong sangsoos second feature effort and clearly much of what he started with in his previous film returns in this film including the multiple connected narratives in this case two and stories of troubled or troubling relationships as well as a potent dosage of ironyone thing that is clearly reduced from his previous work is the flights of fancy that included elements of surrealism however this film also contains a single moment of surreal that strikes a contrast against the otherwise rather realistic depiction found therein the two stories follow a young woman who goes on a trip to kangwon province with her friends only to find herself drawn to a stranger the second about a man who also goes on a trip to kangwon province with his friend and struggles with his relationship woesagain hong shows a strong understanding of irony and of the flaws in human nature and yet i do not think he is entirely unsympathetic when it comes to his characters drawing in just enough compassion to offset the criticism he draws with his irony i think the think i have come to love about hongs films is that they just feel so real especially the complex and conflicted characters not to say that every person is a hypocrite or suffering from confused feelings but rather that these characters he and the actors present feel fully developed and believablethis is not a fast moving film there is a lot of lingering and like the previous film things do not always connect immediately so patience does pay off and in surprising ways there does not appear to be any element of the film that is not intentionally placed in the film and it is made my a little hyperaware of various seemingly extra characters as they get dragged into the mix as the film progressespower is an excellent film that manages to inject a level of personal emotion regret longing into a story that highlights irony and the fallibility of human decisionmaking it is a rather hard balance to keep and it is surprising how hong manages to pull it off twice in a row technical production values have gotten much better since the first film and direction has gotten steady and clear this film does not pack the same emotional wallop that the first does but gains a lot in its assured exploration and the refinement really helps tighten the overall vision great viewing for art cinema lovers eightten,1
two stars out of a possible ten  and that is being overly generousi thought with a cast of james woods cathy bates randy quaid lou gossett jr and henry thomas  how could it miss i was wrongi can only wonder what drugs sam shepard was on the weekend he cranked out this piece of dribble i would long suspected sam s of being kind of nuts this film based on his play confirms itthis is the kind of artsy bs that actors love to sink their teeth into as it gives them a chance to endlessly emote however for the viewer who sits through this nonsensical trash there is absolutely nothing to love about this movieyou have not seen dysfunctional families until you have seen this bunch pa is crazy ma is crazy the son is crazy and the daughter is oh yeah crazy they also have mouths on them that utter words that would make a sailor blush especially the teenage daughterin addition to the above as if that were not enough the plotand it is so thin you could read thorough ithas a hole in it the size of alaskama is conspiring to sell their rundown farm as it turns out so is pa now i do not claim to be a real estate expert but the last time i checked property jointly owned must have both of the owners signatures in order to be sold if only one of them owned the property then the other could not legally sell it so it would be pointless for that person to do so mr shepherd prefers to ignore this basic fact and therefore his plot does not worknot that anything else was really working anywaythe only possible reason anyone could have for watching this film is if they are absolutely desperate to see james woods in full frontal nudity and i cannot imagine why anyone would want to,0
this is a bad movie not one of the funny bad ones either this is a lousy bad one it was actually painful to watch the direction was awfulwith lots of jumping around and the green and yellow hues used throughout the movie makes the characters look sickly keira knightly was not convincing as a tough chick at alland i cannot believe lucy liu and mickey rourke signed on for this criminal waste of celluloid the script was terrible and the acting was like fingernails across a chalkboard if you have not seen itdo not you are not missing anything and will only waste two hours of your life watching this drivel i have seen bad movies before and even enjoyed them due to their faults this one is just a waste of time,0
sophia loren plays aida in one of the worst films of all time she cannot lipsync in terms of production values the film is so bad that at one point while loren is mouthing o patria mia she leans onto what looks to be a stone wall for support and the canvas set billows and shakes,0
this film is so much of a ripoff of the masterpeice demons and that is the only thing that makes the movie worth watching the acting is terriblethe action scenes are speeded upthe script is almost painful and budget non existentif you think this film is good then you havnt seen a real horror film skip this and get a copy of the movie demons,0
this is really really bad lamas shows just how a second rate actor does his job but what makes it worth watching is the scene where oj angrily grabs a fellow cop by the throat as if to kill them while the jukebox plays a song with the lyric i got the evidence on you makes me want to hear the rest of the lyrics  attributed to david gregoli and leslie oren but i could not find it on itunes talk about seeing into the futuretoo funny for words the rest of the movie is forgettable the score and songs are more interesting than the script ditto the sequel which begs the question of why they would do a sequel at all my understanding was that foreign sales drives a lot of these b movies does not say much for the worlds viewing habits,0
yes the first howling was a classic a rather good werewolf movie that i admit started slowly but gained momentum along the way to have a rather good finish then the anchorwoman changed into a cute werewolf only to be gunned down on camera yes that made for an entertaining horror movie to be surewell forget all of that as this movie has nothing to do with that film oh sure they kind of make it out that the anchor woman is the same and that her brother or something is wanting to find out what and why things went down as they did but they go from the little cozy retreat from the first movie to transylvania or somewhere here where they must battle evil magician werewolves or something i often wonder what in the world christopher lee was doing in this movie however i read the trivia here where it says he had never been in a werewolf movie before but still read the script before you take a role maybe you could have gotten into an american werewolf in london hell that could have been possible it was set in london after all heck werewolves do not seem to figure much into this movie except for a rather bizarre and prolonged sex scene in fact the most memorable death in this movie for me was when the one gal started talking loudly and this one dudes ears started bleeding,0
prom night is shot with the artistic eye someone gives while finely crafting a lifetime original film you know the one this october lifetime takes a break from the courageous tale of a woman surviving insert disease name here to tell the somewhat creepy tale of a woman pursued by a stalker exboyfriend it is dramatic  it is sappy  it is immensely dull it does nothing to further a genre tell an original story or strive for any sort of newness prom night shares this plight watching the killer poke holes in his victims we sit silently as they slump to the floor with not a drop of blood spilled it occurred to me that this was the cleanest killer in movie historyour director is working with a fairly goodlooking killer so he is forced to pour on the camera angles to make him appear creepier think about matthew mcconaughey coming at you with a knife you would probably go  oh good lookin guy is going to kill me naaaa not scary even for a second so the director throws schaech into shadows and over the shoulder in the mirror this mirror shot is repeated to the point of sickness as it practically becomes a fetish of the creator you will get fifteen jump scares in this film two of which made my date jump i might mention she is afraid of everything i would also mention she decided to take a nap halfway through the film and at one point threatened to leave meas if this film were not disjointed enough it appears to be cut to shreds i am not saying it looks like key points were left on the cutting room floor as the crew scrambled to salvage some semblance of a horror film i am saying as the film moves from scene to scene you often get a jarring jump this is the kind of thing you would expect when a film catches fire and a projectionist is forced to splice ends together cross his fingers and hope for the best the editor should be shotwith a plot you can pack into two sentences one stray spray of blood an emo killer and the tension of a very special episode of silver spoons we are left with no reason to support horror this weekend  at least on the big screen in fact this is the sort of film that should be punished is it really that hard to make a scary movie was this crew even aware they were making a horror film a complete waste of my time and yours i bit the bullet to get you this review do not let my sacrifice be in vain do not go into the movie,0

this movie has successfully proved what we all already know that professional basketball players suck at everything besides playing basketball especially rapping and acting i can not even begin to describe how bad this movie truly is first of all is it just me or is that the ugliest kid you have ever seen i mean his teeth could be used as a canopener secondly why would a genie want to pursue a career in the music industry when even though he has magical powers he sucks horribly at making music third i have read the bible in no way shape or form did it say that jesus made genies fourth what was the deal with all the crappy special effects i assure you that any acneaddled nerdy teenager with a computer could make better effects than that fifth why did the ending suck so badly and what the hell is a djin and finally whoever created the nightmare known as kazaam needs to be thrown off of a plane and onto the eiffel tower because this movie take the word suck to an entirely new level,0
this is not as violent as i was expecting which makes the violent scenes appear all the more brutal and effectivethere are a lot of twists and turns and back stabbing and double crossing all the way through the film making it hard to know who is side a particular character is onthe plot is pacey with some good dialogue and character development and gives an interesting view of the workings of the triad gang it followsthe violence when it comes is brutal no guns or martial art scenes with special effects this is believable in your face violence and for all the dialogue you are never allowed forget that the triad is a violent criminal organisationthe ending is surprising but thoroughly consistent and believable,1
guys and dolls has to be one of my favorite musical movies ever it is a very fun movie to watch and nothing more it embodies what people have forgotten about musicalsmusicals were made to entertain not to to preach nowadays we have rent and chicago which are great musicals and good movies but they fail to bring us solid entertainment with no strings attached the only thing that bothered me in the movie was marlon brando the guy cannot sing it was very annoying to listen to him sing and talk when i could not understand him if it were not for marlon i would have given this ten stars guys and dolls provides oldfashioned entertainment that we rarely get these days watch it to have a good time,1
this movie is terrible carlitos wayone thousand nine hundred and ninetythree is a great film goodgfellas it is not but its one of the better crime films done this movie should be considered closer to the sting parttwo or maybe speed zone remember those gems the only reason this movie was made was to capitalize on the cult following of the original this movie lacked everything de palma pacino and penn worked so hard on there was not a likable character and that is the fault of everyone responsible for making it i hope rise to power wins every razzie it possibly can and maybe even invent some new categories to allow it be a record holder after i watched this st fest movie i sat down and watched the original carlitos way to get th bad taste out of my mouth after watching this i wish pachanga came and whacked me out of my misery,0

i am always wary of taking too instant a dislike to a film look at it a month later and you might see it differently or dig it up after fifty years in a different continent and some cult followers find something stylistically remarkable that went unnoticed at first after sitting through the great ecstasy of robert carmichael at its uk premiere it came as no surprise to me that i found the question and answer session afterwards more interesting than the film itself shane danielsen artistic director of the edinburgh international film festival aided by the films director and producer gave a spirited defence of a movie than received an overall negative response from the audience edinburgh festival audiences are not easily shocked only one person walked out in disgust the criticisms of the film included very articulate and constructive ones from the lay public as well as an actor and a woman who teaches ma film directors this was not an overly shocking film there was a degree of uninterrupted sexual violence but far less extreme than many movies most actual weapon contact was obscured as were aroused genitals the audience disliked it because they had sat through two hours that were quite boring where the acting standards were not high where the plot was poor predictable and drawn out and where they had been subjected to clumsy and pretentious filmmaking on the promise of a controversial movie metaphors to the war in iraq are contrived overemphasised and sloppy apart from a general allusion to violence any deeper meaning is unclear and the figleaf reference marquis de sade as one audience member put it seems a mere tokenistic excuse for lack of plot development towards the finalewe have the story of an adolescent who has a certain amount going for him he stands out at school for his musical ability but takes drugs and hangs out with youths who have little or nothing going for them and whose criminal activities extend to rape and violence when pushed robert seems to have a lot of violence locked inside himthe film is not entirely without merit the audience is left to decide how robert got that way was it the influence of his peers why did all the good influences and concern from parents and teachers not manage to include him in a better approach to life cinematically there is a carefullymontaged scene where he hangs back whether through too much drugs shyness a latent sense of morality or just waiting his turn several of his friends are raping a woman in a back room partly glimpsed and framed in the centre of the screen in the foreground of the bare bones flat a dj is more concerned that the girls screams interrupt his happy house music than with any thought for the woman ultimately he is a bit annoyed if their activities attract police attention the stark juxtaposition of serious headphones enjoyment of his music even when he knows a rape is going on points up his utter disdain in a deeply unsettling way robert slumps with his back to us in the foregroundbut the rest of the film including its supposedly controversial climax involving considerable if not overly realistic sexual violence is not up to this standard some people have had a strong reaction to it the filmmakers stated intention if they vomit we have succeeded in producing a reaction but mostly  and as far as i can tell the edinburgh reaction seems to mirror reports from cannes  they feel why have programmers subjected us to such inferior quality filmmaking director clay hugh can talk the talk but has not developed artistic vision his replies about holding up a mirror to life to tell the truth about things that are swept under the carpet even his defence that there is little plot development because he did not want to do a standard hollywood movie  all are good answers to criticisms but unfortunately they do not apply to his film any more than they do to holding up a mirror while someone defecates or wastes film while playing ineptly with symbols wanting to try and give him the benefit of any lingering doubt i spoke to him for a few minutes after the screening but i found him as distasteful as his movie and soon moved to the bar to wash my mouth out with something more substantial there are many truths one aspect of art is to educate another to entertain another to inspire i had asked him if he had any social or political agenda and he mentions ken loach one of the many great names he takes in vain without going so far as to admit any agenda himself he then falls back on his mantra about his job being to tell the truth i am left with the feeling that this was an overambitious project for a new director or else a disingenuous attempt to put himself on the map by courting publicity for second rate workandy warhol could paint a tin of soup and it was art clay hugh would like to emulate the great directors that have made controversial cinema and pushed boundaries sadly his ability at the moment only extends to making highsounding excuses for a publicityseeking film,0

these slasher pics are past their sell by date but this one is good funthe valentine cards themselves are witty and well thought outthe film has one peach of a line he is no angel when he in fact is angel watching buffy reruns will never be the samethe cast is a sizzling display of young talent but the story does not give them enough real depth denise richards on the dvd extras seemed to think the girls on set bonded well together and this would give the feeling that you empathised with their characters sorry but nothe direction is very good managing to show very little actual gore and relying on your imaginations implied threat much can be said also for the similar manner in which miss richards and heigel do not remove their clothesessentially the main directorial plus lies within the borrowing of various other ideas from previous slasher flicks psychos shower scene is tributed along with halloweens masking murdering someone hiding in a bodybag though is a pretty original one as far as i knowlight viewing not very scary but a few good jump moments if it was a choice between the hole and this though choose the hole slasher movies have had their day and this is just another slasher a very good slasher but nothing groundbreaking,1

harvey keitals best performance so far the new century very nicely photographed a beautiful snapshot of precastro cuba the story revolves around the nephew of a local minor crime boss who develops a friendship with an american with hollywood connections it is really about the moment when a boy awakens to the fact that the small circle of people he knows actually live in a much larger much more complex world that he does not yet understandthe script is strong and filled with humor the direction is crisp over all a really professional job that fits in well with the tradition of latin american cinema the one weakness is the decision to shoot in syncsound english rather than spanish  probably to improve sales in the us unfortunately this just makes the film a little less convincing but if you can see beyond this you will find a heartfelt trip to another world recommended,1
this a superb selfcontained work that is unconnected with anything before or after brat pack crooning and club exclusivity are not my biscuits of choice but in this lawfree world they make an alluring ambiance the film is packed with our guys distinctive actors who add distinction to this work with winning performances the dialogue is a joy in fact it is a new vernacular one of the few films that can be watched repeatedly with deepening appreciationhighpoints include billy idols british loutishness ben londons vulturine brassware kyles squirmishness and the survey of ad hoc philosophies,1

after all the crap that hollywood and the indies have churned out we finally get a movie that delivers some scary moments there are some clichéd moments but i am not sure it is possible nowadays to make an entirely original movie there is not much new hereit is just done wellmake sure and pay attention as the subtle scares come quickly and often this is not a movie to watch while you are eating pizzathere is one very wellwritten red herring in this movie and unfortunately one very poorlycast role cheri christian just does not make an effective julie the wifemother for one thing she is totally unsympathetic i know i knowshe is just gone through a traumatic experience but the viewer never gets to know her as she normally is and the relationship between her and her husband is rather discomforting in an unintentional way i think that the director had meant for us to have some sympathy for her but i never didfinally a thumbsup for the ending which is both disturbing and satisfying it could easily have been cheapened with a sound effect at the beginning of the end credits but the director wisely resistedthis is not a masterpiece by any means but it is a good oldfashioned scary moviesomething that is rather rare nowadays,1
when i first heard about this movie i thought it would be like the duchesstwo thousand and eight but when i saw the first thirty minutes of the young victoria i knew this would not just be a solid movie almost everything in this movie is great the costumes are really amazing and the settings are also beautifully shotthe only thing that really let me down are the performances emily bluntthe devil wears prada is the star of the film bringing victoria to life and with this movie she shows that she is a great actress and maybe picking a first oscar nomination for her performance rupert friend is almost bland as prince albert but he has great chemistry with emily blunt paul bettany is also solid as lord melbourne although i expected more of him jim broadbent and miranda richardson both have supporting roles but are forgettableto me the film feels like unfinished maybe that the screenwriters changed too many things in the script i do not know but that is how i feel about the moviebut overall it is a great movie about the early years of victoria with a great performance from emily blunt,1
unless i am sadly mistaken i rented a nightmare on elm street three several years ago and there was a music video i am pretty sure which was called dream warriors at the end of it and i rented this one on dvd hoping that the video would be there because it was one of the funniest things i have ever seen it is amazing how stuff from the eightys is so funny now but nothing is funnier than eightys rap videos there was this rap group singing that song dream warriors on the vhs version of this movie after the credits and they are all wearing like denim jackets with no shirt underneath and form fitting jean shorts that are all frayed at the bottoms like daisy dukes what could make a rap group look more foolish i cannot imaginespoilers at any rate i was disappointed in looking for that video on the dvd version so all i had was this mediocre installment in the freddy krueger series the movie sort of starts off with the same idea as part two with the main character witnessing all kinds of gruesome murders and then sort of coming out of a trance and finding himself with the bloody hands kristen parker patricia arquette has a nightmare about the infamous house that nancy thompson used to live in then runs to the bathroom the sinks handles turn into freddys hands and attack her and then she wakes up standing in her bathroom having slit her own wrists from there the movie turns into the usual mental hospital installment larry fishburne tired of always playing the bad guy in his roles was happy to take on the role in this film as a niceguy orderly stern but accommodating when the patients want to bend the rules a little not surprisingly he turns in what is by leaps and bounds the best performance in the movie arquette later goes on to become an accomplished actor but had not perfected her acting skills when she starred in this film the characters in the movie are mostly all patients at the mental hospital that kristen is placed into after cutting her wrists all of them are cynical and uncooperative almost none believing that they really belong there at all eventually they realize and are able to convince the staff that they are all having dreams about the same man and it is not just some kind of group hysteriaheather langenkamp has returned in her famous role as nancy thompson this time grown up into a dream researcher as a result of her childhood experiences involving freddy krueger not surprisingly she is able to quickly relate to the hysterical kristen and the rest of the patients since she had experienced exactly what they are going through there are some interesting murders in this installment and the technology used for the special effects have taken a huge jump there is a gigantic wormlike freddy that tries to swallow kristen whole there is a scene where a television turns into freddy and with mechanical arms he picks up one of the patients there for some late night entertainment and punishes her for sitting too close to the tv but there is also an unconvincing gomotion scene where a couple guys have a fight with freddy kruegers skeleton which has been rotting in the trunk of some car in a car junkyard and one of the more groaninducing scenes was one where freddy attacks one of the patients in his dream the one famous for sleepwalking tearing the muscles and tendons out of his arms and legs and leading him around like a puppet ouchwe get a peek into freddys past in this installment not only do we meet his mother but we also find out the circumstances that led to freddy being fathered by more than one hundred maniacs in fighting freddy the patients all band together and in their dreams use their special powers most of which reflect their shortcomings in real life to fight him one student bound to a wheelchair is able to walk in his dreams another has the hilarious powers of what he calls the wizard master another is beautiful and bad she has lots of makeup her hair stands up in a foothigh mohawk and she has knives clever but the movie falters when it has only one of the patients the one who cannot speak not have any powers in his dreams until the climax of the movie when he suddenly realizes that he can talk in his dreams at just the right moment to save the day his dream power was a little too obvious to have been left out for that long but collectively now you see why the movie was subtitled dream warriorsaltogether this is not an entirely weak entry into the series the acting is pretty shoddy but it is actually pretty good for a horror movie larry fishburne vastly overshadows the rest of the cast displaying wonderful acting skills early on in his career and the movie is not simply a rehash of either of the first two  a problem that plagues the friday the thirteenth movies much more than the elm street films the characters are never developed enough to allow for the later creation of much tension which is why most of the deaths come across more as creative ways to kill off someone in a horror film than the tragic loss of the life of one of the characters that we have come to know and root for their triumph over evil but then again not a lot of horror movies take the time to really develop their characters to the point where you throw up your hands in defeat when they are killed or are on the edge of your seat as they run for their lives but it is important to note that the few horror films that actually do that are almost invariably the best ones,0
sidney stratton is having trouble maintaining jobs at various textile mills mainly because of his experimentation in the textile laboratories strattons experimenting on a formula for a new fabric which would create the ultimate fabric one that never gets dirty never wrinkles or wears out when stratton eventually creates the fabric he creates enemies in all the textile workers who will lose their jobs and the owners who will lose money since one mill has the exclusive rights so stratton in his white suit becomes the most hunted man in england the film is ideal and only ealing could have made it so guiness performance and a great supporting cast such as greenwood thesiger and parker and mackendricks direction make the film a delight but the real hero is the story itself a nice satire on business and industry with additional elements of drama romance and suspense rating eight,1
mr michael jackson is an artistic phenomenon his short movies ie music videos are simply the best i do not care if i get a sane scifi feature from this man but i do care to get a medley of his crazy dancing shriek yells cool crowd choreography and some bits of cgi and animation there also should be a few uninterrupted videos everything i have mentioned is here stupid plot and overthetop vanity fair are not a problem when i witness mr michael jackson in action to me he will always be the ultimate king of music videos not king of pop which sounds moronic especially for us russians because pop sounds like the russian word for arses and mj is definitely not king of arses i can rewatch his best music videos which are artistically beautiful and i never get tired of themmy first impression of this film was what is this bits of different videos some drawn images unsettling jumps from one theme to another absence of any cohesive plot line some kids fooling around etc but as i watched it till the end i could tell that it was great and really nothing like anything else shown on tv nowadays what i like here too is that it never shows any shameful material and can be watched by kids easilywithout mr michael jackson the universe of music videos would be rather poor even the best classic videos of other artists cannot come very close to the energetic hyperbole of mj musical insanity and artistic quality he knew how to get the audience of different ages and he knew how to remain a man with moral principleswhen i see a proper dvd release with mr michael jackson videos i know that it deserves to be purchased even if some clips have already appeared in some other previous release history i history ii and moonwalker are all great though only moonwalker is more like one movie with a solid smooth criminal theme paparazzi topic and a few weird spoofs and twistsbeing no fan of mj i can still give this film like no other a solid nine out of ten i have been hit by smooth criminal for sure and my major complains are the following initial segments of the movie could have been dropped while the main mj antidrug campaign should have been given more skyrocketing insanity and stress and there should have been more moonwalking itself of course thanks for attention,1
hitokiri which translates roughly as assassination aka tenchu which translates roughly as divine punishment showcases hideo gosha at the top of his form do not miss this one or goshas other classic goyokin hitokiri is not only one of goshas best films it is one of the best samuraichambara films ever made and perhaps one of the best japanese films ever exportedbe warned all of the intricate plot details in hitokiri can be a little hard to follow for those unfamiliar with nineteenth century japanese history even so the underlying human drama is obvious and open to all viewers as per the norm for gosha hitokiri provides yet another variation on his traditional theme of loyalty to ones lord vs doing the right thing however gosha develops his favorite theme with such sophistication that it is really the movie to see along with goyokin of coursei suppose it breaks down like this if you want a simpler more actionoriented tale you might want to see goyokin however if you want a more thoughtful multilayered albeit grim drama see this oneok ok essentially the historical backdrop is a massive power grap between many different samurai clans who are either one working to reform yet retain the tokugawa shogunate and two those who are trying to install the emperor meiji as the supreme ruler of japan of course those clans working for emperor meiji were often less interested in reforming japan than in ensuring their own clan more power in the new world order ironically the entire feudal system was officially abolished as one of the first reforms of the meiji government it is ironic twists like this  goshas big on irony  that make the entire plot all the more bittersweetwhat distinguishes hitokiri from goshas other movies is goshas mature sense of cinematography every shot is thoughtfully composed and much like kubricks barry lyndon each frame of the movie could hold its own as a still composition of course this is typical gosha hitokiri really stands out with stunning backdrops includingas with goyokin many riveting seascapes just watch the opening sequence and you are hooked make no mistake this is no english period piece hitokiri is extremely violent do not say you were not warnedwhat else other than cool camera work makes hitokiri stand out the performances seem to me a bit more subtle in this one katsu shintaro of zatoichihanzo the razor fame turns in a star performance as the conflicted protagonistantihero okada izo katsu manages to instill humanity to a character that seems almost more wild animal than villain throughout the movie you are never quite sure if you are engaged or revolted by okadas character at the same time katsus portrayal of okadas ravenous hunger for respect and his later pathetic attempts at redemption seem so human that you cannot help but feel empathysympathy of course after seeing nakadai tatsuya play the tortured hero in goyokin it is great to see him play such a ruthless villain in hitokiri he is just perfect there is nothing more to sayas a final note perhaps more interesting to buffs than to casual fans do not miss the last screen appearance of mishima yukio yes the closeted gay rightwing ultranationalist novelist who committed suicide by seppuku before the crowd of jeering japanese military personnel he kidnapped in one thousand nine hundred and seventy and had a movie on his life and work made by paul schrader who actually does a pretty solid job of portraying the honorable for an assassin shinbei tanaka,1
from the q  a before and after this is what i could gather some irish guy wants to make a movie nothing in particular just any movie so one night at a party he hears some exroadie tell him a classic bit of rock n roll lore the one about how gram parsons corpse was stolen from lax by his loyal roadie so he could honor parsons wishes that he be cremated out in joshuatree wowwhat a great idea for a movie rock n roll well country grave robbing escapes friendship the seventys i guess we could get johnny knoxville from jackass because it is kind of a prank right and knoxville wants to do a movie too why he must have thought he had the next snatch on his handbut this storys not really that excitingwe need something for knoxville to struggle againstlike a psychotic girlfirend after his money but parsons was married at the time that is ok no one knows that besides we could get christina applegate but what if the audience does not like the idea of stealing a corpsewell we will get his dad to join the chase but give permission in the end but parsons dad killed himself when he was ten in fact his orphan status and tragic childhood are key parts of the parsons mythology mythology we are making a movie this is creative problem solvingit is an uncomfortable experience for anybody even vaguely knowledgeable on or interested in the subject applegates presence is doubling jarring first her invented character is a beverly hills bitch before her time she might as well have walked around the whole movie a cell phone in her hand and secondly what kind of man would parsons be if he ever associated himself with that kind of harpy facts are not just distorted or left out but reversed they could have easily found the villain they wanted in parsons stepfather who was attempting to whisk the body back to his home state where law would favor him in dividing up the considerable inheritanceand the music oh the music i love the music is hacked up the bridge of a song here the chorus there forced to the background and in the end horribly covered by the hippest new indie band starsailor my girlfriend asked the unnecessary but irresistable question after the movie was anyone up there the writer the producers the director actually a gram parsons fan well no he would never actually heard of gram parsons but of course blah blah blah i learned to love it and here is some factoids i read in a bio online another guy vouched for parsons coolness by saying he and keith richards tripped on acid together and wrote wild horses together a mixed up bunch of facts as offbase as the movie another person asked was not it morally questionable to rewrite history when most people would only know about it from this film well he had the real roadies permission he was even set and the parsons estate gave permission and all these other people who got paychecks said it was greatbut what i really wondered was and asked in the embarassingly trembling voice of a truly impassioned parsons geek was if the movies so cheaply made a million had they not considered the original gram parsons fanbase as an audience the director and writer seemed to think he was a nothing figure with no fanbase though i doubt any mojo magazine reading countryrock seventys music fan would agree but a bunch of brits made it i guess and they just did not care about cosmic american music or even knew it existed this is not just not a truthful parsons flick it is not even in the right spirit it does not even fit the legend at the very least it should have had the sentimentality of one of his songs and plenty of people would love to be toldi should mention the movie was received well from the bunch of stoned college kids just off the slopes and into johnny knoxville but if you are a parsons fan ignore the title it is just a movie for jackass fans,0
yes it can be done john de bello and costa dillon cleaned out the garbage of their minds and come up with the worst comedic horror  scfi musical if there is any acting it is terrible or way over the top special effects take your pickvery low budget or kindergarten every cheap cliché thought of is used no doubt a fun movie to watch worth a cold sixpack or two point the finger at radiation if you need an excuse mutant tomatoes grow to almost the size of a tow truck and begin attacking mankind san diego is a good place as any to start scientists and an absent minded military must find the way to stop this red rolling menace this cult favorite features david miller eric christmas al sklar tom coleman sharon taylor and john qualls,0
richard pryors early eightys running down the street on fire incident must have affected him somehow in his stand uphe jokes about it getting great laughs it seemed to have done something involving the projects he chose the toy is about the lamest he ever choseaside from i guess another youa movie where a white man buys his son a black man nice little bit of underlying political incorrectness before thee was such a thing it is seeing richard getting all sentimental that made me finally walk out before the end i wanted to see pryor get even with this bratinstead it becomes the misunderstood kid nauseum at least gleason had his moments ignore this and watch pryor with gene wilder or any of his seventys stuff this is a waste of any movie watchers time,0
i can remember watching this for the first time when i was nine years old i wanted to be one of the barbarian brothers this movie is still great one original aspect was that the fight scenes where very short implying that the barbarian brothers where so good that they finished there enemies off quickly plus you have chases a cage fight a dragon and yes even a bar brawl yes the acting is bad so that is why it is not a ten also the story line has received a lot of criticism i think it is quite original not to many movies in it is genre have the same original story lines or colorful dialogue i definitely recommend this film,1
minor spoilerunderrated little stephen king shocker it is not perfect by any stretch of the imaginationeven if the limp performances of dale midkiff and denise crosby were better there would still be the mismanaged mystical story elements to contend with the old micmac burial ground rachels terminally ill sister and the jacobmarleyan victor pascow never really come together into anything coherent and the film in places feels confused and overstuffed but few horror movies really are perfect and what this one may lack in other areas it makes up for in its willingness to shock pet sematary may actually be one of the cruelest horror films in recent memory with its murderous zombie baby and its insanely insensitive portrayal of zelda it is politically incorrect it is tasteless it is gratuitousand yet it makes us squirm with revulsion in a way safer horror movies never can add to that one of fred gwynnes best performances and mary lamberts witty direction and you have an intensely satisfying scary movieeven with the hokey ending highly recommended for genre fans sevenfive out of ten,1
deliverance is the fascinating haunting and sometimes even disturbing tale by james dickey turned into a brilliant movie by john boorman it is about four businessmen driven by manhood and machobehavior who are spending a canoeing weekend high up in the mountains up there they are faced with every darkest side of man and every worst form of human miserypoverty buggery and even physical harassment these four men intended to travel down the river for adventure and excitement but their trip soon changes into an odyssey through a violent and lurking mountainland completely estranged from all forms of civilisation all these elements actually make deliverance one of the most nightmarish films i have ever seen just about everything that happens to these men you pray that you will never find yourself to be in a similar situation pure talking cinema deliverance is a very important movie as well john boormans best closely followed by zardoz and excalibur was  and still is  a very influential film and it contains several memorable scenes that already featured in numberless other movies just think about the terrific duelling banjos musical score and of course the unforgettable homosexual squeal like a pig rape scene all the actors deliver haha perfect acting performances especially jon voight a must see motion picture,1
if you like to be entertained do not go see this movie if you like to see heroics of war do not go see this movie if you like to see good acting and an excellent screenplay do not go see this movie if you like typical hollywood war films that end just in time to give a politically charged appeal to the public about the greatness and glory of war go see this movie otherwise do not waste your time i am always interested in war movies because i think that if they are done well they can teach us something about the paradoxical and worthless qualities of war this film shows a bunch of guys running around the countryside saying whorrible cliche lines doing the most predictable things and defending the oppressed with the same exact force and brutality that was being given to the oppressed this film is a disgrace to filmmaking and to the united states of america can you imagine being a person from europe or africa or any other country and watching this being told that this is how americans truly are no wonder everyone hates us please please please do not waste your time on this piece of junk if you must wait and rent it fourten,0
while i do not consider myself a big fan of fairy tale movies stardust intrigued me based on seeing michelle pfeiffer in the trailers as a villain especially since i was about to see her as the bossy velma von tussle in hairspray boy is she so convincingly evil here as a witch especially with her ageugly makeup in the beginning and end robert de niro is also great as the pirate captain who is forced to hide in the closet to protect his reputation just about all the actors like claire danes rupert everett ricky gervais peter otoole and many others do fine work here while danes and pfeiffer are classic beauties there is also stunning faces of sienna miller olivia grant as girl bernard and kate magowan especially when we first meet her newcomer charlie cox is fine as the lead tristan and he looked so much like his father dunstan as a young man that i thought that was him in early scenes with magowan actually ben barnes many comments have compared this to the princess bride and while i can see some resemblances the main difference was that with pb you always knew it was just an imaginary tale as told by an old man to his grandson stardust makes you believe for the most part that what you are seeing and hearing could have actually happened even with all the hilarity that happens throughout so on that note i highly recommended stardust,1
i consider myself a huge movie buff i was sick on the couch and popped in this film right from the opening to the end i watched in awe at these great actors i would never seen say great word the filming was beautiful it was just what i needed i hope that this message is heard over any bad comments written by others the director has a heart and it beats with his actors throughout thanku for making a film like this one just wonderfully awkward beautiful kind characters who are flawed and graceful all at once just great i cannot submit this without ten lines in total so i will simply go on to say that i wish for more from this director more from all the actors in this film and more from the writer i did not want it to end the end,1
jet li is one of the best hand to hand combat fighters in the world he has been for over twenty years and he puts others in the genre to shame while he is big in asia he is almost unknown here in the usblack mask is supposed to be a breakout movie for him but it fails horribly first of all it is dubbed while it may have camp value the dubbing is not even close and it is flat in tone it seems inappropriate for the ordinary movie viewer secondly the director in this movie daniel lee does a horrible job he cuts scenes so fast at times you do not know what is going on other times the camera shakes and wobbles fans see jet lis movies for the fantastic martial arts however the director edits the scenes so fast that you do not even know who is who half the time other times a scene is left hanging ie li is beginning to cut a hole in the floor of a jeep while the badguys arm their guns two seconds later both li and the love interest are already under the car other scenes are so improbable that they cross over the point of being completely ridiculous killer cd roms just give him throwing stars li needs a director who is less prone to machine gun cutting and more to creating a cinematic miseascene the added raptechno music goes from being okay to intrusive the plot has possibilities but are all squandered by cartoonish characters that take away from any credibility that this movie strives for and are we really to believe that the love interest would not recognize simon because he has a half mask on would not the hair lower jaw or voice give it awayif you want to see a jet li movie try iron monkey or his classic shaolin temple this disjointed mess is a complete waste of timetwoten,0
most of the french films i have seen  and enjoyed  were more talk than action but that is okay i found them interesting wellphotographed and with intriguing actors however i did at one point wonder if gerald depardieu was in every french film ever made it seemed that waythis movie has the same interesting visuals and had a good opening but then it became talk talk and more talkwhich is fine for a drama but not for a murder mystery after awhile i almost fell asleep watching thisactually the film was more like a play with almost all the scenes played out in one room thus if you love plays you should like thisbut i want a little more bang for a murder story,0
poorly structured badly written loaded with cliches and flat dialogue not a single scene shines the actors struggle with a painfully dull scenario that manages to completely avoid any surprises plot twists or conflict you know from the first ten minutes where it is goingfor a movie set in ny it has almost no feeling for the city there are a dozen other indie movies that manage to make it seem magical on a small budget this one seems like it was shot in torontoif you cast natasha henstridge why dress her in baggy sweaters why make vartan look boring and drab where is the attraction i felt like i was watching a subpar christian movie of the week it was so asexual and moralizingsteven feders big success is that he convinced people to make this bland movie,0
a bondage humiliation sm show and not much else the plot is flat really just a banal setup for the stylishly depraved setpieces the host of the aforementioned show a silly little man who spouts drivel while prancing around the stage in dresses was almost as painfully distracting as the attempts at artful editing the dreamlike ending felt tacked on to the films credit though aya sugimoto was fairly convincing as the tortured lead flower and snake has been compared with eyes wide shut but aside from some minor surface similarities kubricks is easily the more layered artistic and atmospheric picture,0
this is quite possibly the worst acting i have ever seen in a movie ever and what is up with the casting the leading lady in this movie has some kind of nose disfiguration and is almost impossible to look at for any period of time without becoming fixated on her nose you could go to your local grocery store on a sunday afternoon and easily find fifty more qualified better looking possible leading ladies i made the unfortunate mistake of renting this movie because it had a cool dvd case this movie looks like it is just some class project for a group of multimedia students at a local technical college i would rather have spent the hour or so that this movie was on watching public access television at least the special effects are better and the people on there are more attractive than anyone you will see in this film,0
this movie was definitely the worst movie i have seen in my entire life and i have seen some pretty bad movies i did not like the way this movie was filmed all of the actors are unknown and it looks as though a bunch of friends got together and decided to film their own movie but it is absolutely horrible i have never seen a worse movie the story is so fake and i just found that it took a really long time to get to the end of the movie there was no plot it looked as though it was not planned out before they started filming the story is too weird i did not like how slow it took to get to the point of the movie there was no point in even filming this movie if you are considering watching this movie do not you are just wasting your time,0
this movie is among my favorite foreign films some of the others are amilee and my life as a dog the similarities with those movies as with so many great foreign films is that it takes a mundane slice of life and transforms it into a profound heartfelt lesson in japan a man who is bored with his mundane life and the rut of his married life sees a beautiful japanese woman staring out the window of a dance studio in the instant that it takes his train to pass he is enthralled by her but is it only by her beauty by her faraway glance or a connection that they will both discover that they share shall we dance has memorable wonderful characters who have to deal with painful realities by transcending them through the world of dance breaking traditional moulds and stereo types of japanese society they risk all for happiness and find that joy is not too far away it is one of those movies that is so magical and meaningful and in itself transcends the mundane by showing the true magic and miracle that life can be,1
geez this is one of those movies that you think you previously reviewed but you did not i mean you did not give a crap about it but somehow it came to your mindto be honest and brief this is one of the worst boring and stupid slashers ever made i cannot say anything good about this piece of crap because there are barely decent sequences that could tell it is made by professional film makersthe death scenes are horrible bloodless stupid the plot is somehow good taking in account that it copied popcorn from one thousand nine hundred and ninetyoneto make things even worse this is not a movie so bad that it is good it is just plain badmolly ringwald tried to do her best but it was not enough,0
i was always curious about this film because it is so tough to find so when i stumbled upon it on ebay i forked over the ten and bought it now i understand why its so rare this film is so bad so terribly written and hopelessly low budget that the ending credits which show all of the cut scenes where they fumbled their lines are literally the movies highlight the film is about a psychic pettyjohn cast for one obvious reason her topless scene whom uses her powers with an experimental machine to pull objects from another dimension into this reality when she pulls in some kind of box like object the military nonchalantly throws it into the open back of a truck with one soldier to guard it and gee what do you know surprise a kid in a foamrubber monster costume pops out instantly kills the soldier with a scratch across his face then escapes to a nearby city but rather than deploy half the armed forces of the county to find it and protect the public those in charge just leave it up to pettyjohn and ray to find it on their own but no matter this movie blows all its credibility long before then this barely escapes being voted a one by me only because of unintentional laughs somebody needs to alert the producers of mystery science theater three thousand if they do not know about it already two out ten really really bad,0
i am not quite sure why but this movie just does not play the way it should it should be humerous and fun but instead is just boring i think a large part of it is because they way over played the gadgets the old cartoon it is based on is much betterthreeten,0
my scalp still smarts from the burning coals heaped on it when i vowed i love this film bring on the coals i will walk over them as well to say again that i love bend it like beckham granted there is a lot of in spite of in that confession it is a bit movieoftheweek the screenplay is on the paintbynumbers side and most troublingly the directors commentary implies that in this film beauty can be found primarily amongst the white of skinthe films genius is not in what is obvious to the syd fielddoctored eye character arcs themes construction it is in both the surface and what lurks deep beneath but not in those layers of artistic topsoil that reviewers seem most often to scratch at powerful sometimes semiclad female bodies not simply on display but kicking the crap out of a football do a better job of naturalizing female strength and agility than lara croft or zhang ziyi will ever do these are real bodies keira knightleys excepted whose work is not to look great first and kick butt later they are working bodies whose beauty is in their movement and selfdetermination and in my book lead actress parminder nagra is one of the most gorgeous creatures ever captured on screen  not only because she can lay claim to that hackneyed adjective luminous but because her performance has an honesty and unbookish intelligence that is utterly compellingthe result is a film women can enjoy without feeling like they are making a pact with the devil to do so as in chadhas bride and prejudice the relationships amongst women sizzle with a chemistry that cannot be neatly slotted into the stodgy sweet valley high categories of best friends or sisters perhaps chadha is even right in her commentary to disavow the films flirtation with lesbianism bend it like beckham has an electricity that cannot be reduced to the simple heterohomosexual love triangle its conventionally structured script would suggest the precise nature of its pleasure is ultimately a bit of a mystery  and is all the more seductive for itoh yes and did i mention that it is hilarious,1
this movie is great brad pitt will never be able to out act the performance he gave in this movie duchovny was top notch as was forbes and lewis the four main characters embark on a scenic road tour of historic murder sites in one of the coolest cars ever made one thousand nine hundred and sixtys model lincoln continental early grace is a simpleton with a taste for dry toothbrushes and carnage he likes his women to not curse or smoke and wear pwt dresses duchovny and forbes are a pair of artists from the city while early and lewis are trailer parkers from the rural outskirts even though the majority tone in the film is dark there are plenty of funny scenes to be had the writing directing and acting are brilliant if you like road movies murder humor and narration watch this film everyone delivers and you will want more when the credits roll one of my all time favorites heyshave that dog n teach it to hunt,1
this is without a doubt one of the worst movies ever i emphasize ever made what´s worse my old hero dolph is in it and he´s starring it jesus the story is actually quite good but the way it´s carried out made even my body hurt the fighting scenes for starters are about as well choreographed as a fight between two drunks slugging it out in the gutter the actors except for dolph who kind of sucks also perform so badly you can´t help but wonder if their reason for being there is that they´re all friends of the director who by the way must have been absent most if not all of the time this is §twelve million spent in an unimaginable way because by the look of the effects and scenery the cost can´t be a cent above §one thousand,0
i am a fan of crash and blade runner and this movie explores some of those highway death and eightys film noir themes that i like to see so i enjoyed itin general though the essential stupidity of the film noir protagonist is not pulled off well by the female lead and her hero is nearly a neanderthal hence the kitch warning,1
although i had some hopes for this film particularly since i enjoy the acting of jason segel freaks  geeks undeclared so much i must say it was one of the worst films i have seen in recent memory loser and dr t and the women are also on that listyes there were a couple of laugh out loud moments although the movie could have been so much better the premise was not bad scam artists cheating their way through college meet their match when they are discovered by someone with a proposition for them the problem is that the characters were all so unlikable that i did not care about any of them the blackmailer played by talented jason schwartzman was such a psychopath that it was not that funny to watch him he was not deranged in a particularly funny or charming way he was just a crazy loser who was actually rather dangerous and not fun to watch the editing of the movie was hard to follow it kept cutting between fantasy and reality and it was often unclear which was which only two or three of the gangs scams were really shown you just had to take it on faith that they were indeed scam artists showing their schemes would have made for a better movie the socalled love story was absurd and unbelievable in fact it was silly and poorly written and directed throughout i could go on about the movies shortcomings but you get the idea not worth the four rental or the gas it takes to drive to and from the movie store to rent,0
the big problem is where to begin as this movie needs your attention the forthcoming two hours and you better not miss some minutes for getting a coke as there is a danger you cannot follow but good there is also a pausebutton bruce willis must travel into a timemachine to find out some antivirus for a virus that made animals rule over the world in one thousand nine hundred and ninetysix thanks to some mistakes he first ends up in one thousand nine hundred and ninety then in the first world war and how messed up it all might look like terry gilliam comes up with what must be one of the most intelligent scripts ever this exmonty phyton man knows exactly how genius sfstories has to be told like and his choice of cast could not have been any better there is the lunatic brad pitt his performance in the asylum is memorable and a superb bruce willis who proves he is more than some schwarzeneggerwant to be it is a movie you can watch over and over again as the script is so weird and complicated and yet you can follow that every view gives you other surprises one of my big favourites,1

zombi three has an interesting history in it is making firstly it is a sequel to fulcis hit zombi two with zombi two itself being of course a marketing ploy to trick people into thinking it was a sequel to george a romeros dawn of the dead aka zombi confusing enough basically none of the films have anything to do with one another but who cares when they make money i guess fulci himself starting to not care about the production about half way through zombi three when he decided to walk out bruno mattei was brought on board to help pad the film with additional scenes to lengthen the running timezombi threes plot is your typical zombie fare scientists develop a serum on an island in the philippines terrorists steal it unleashing a plague and zombie run amok the scientists want to create an antidote while the military is set on mowing down everyone without prejudice there are also brief inserts of a radio dj preaching about how we treat the planet overall i actually liked this film i heard horrible things but i find the goofy dialogue quite enjoyable the film seems to be an attempt at raising awareness about pollution corrupted military man playing god etc i get the feeling this was at one point a serious film but it veered off in a weird direction presumably when mattei came on boardbesides ripping off other zombie flicks this was very reminiscent of romeros the crazies you hear the radio dj breaking the good news with when you see the men in white suits  gas masks run to them for help this is of course played to the images of the men in white gunning down zombies later they straight up steal a scene from crazies in which one of the regular uncontaminated people is killed by mistakethe gore factor is pretty good in this one with zombie hordes around every corner how is it cool let me count the waysone zombie birth two flying zombie head three zombie birds four zombie with no legs swimming in a pool my favorite zombie was the machetewielding maniac at the gas station he was bad ass and nearly tore down the entire building trying to kill a girlfavorite quote  when a sergeant insists on cremating a zombie the scientists asks do not you think that once the ash is in the air it will fall to the ground and contaminate everything to which the sargeant boldly replies now you are talking science fiction he also continues to mention the science fiction told by the scientists even at the end when everyone diesextras gallery trailers and interviews most notably the one with mattei where he insists he directed forty of the scenes yet cannot recall which ones or any other significant detailsbottom line a must see for zombie and fulci fansrating seventenmolly celaschi  myspacecomhorroryearbook,1
this film which is based on a true story comes from first time director and long time actor denzel washington denzel washington has given us some of the best performances of the last decade as a black soldier in the civil war in glory and a lawyer in the acclaimed philadelphia and of course he made special notoriety last year when he won the academy award for best actor in training day in which denzel washington became the first african american to receive the award for best actor i guess denzel wanted a change of pace so he chose to direct antwone fisher in which he also stars fisher is played by derek luke who is new to the silver screen but has made some guest appearances on such television shows as king of queens and he will be appearing in the upcoming film release of biker boyz	this is a truly well done film from denzel washington considering it was his first time directing undoubtedly denzel felt some kind of commitment and believed in the real life story of antwone fisher antwone fisher is about a young african american man in the navy who constantly gets into fights and after one particular brawl he is sent to see a navy psychiatrist named jerome davenport played by denzel washington davenport helps antwone to deal with his troubled past and learn to move on with his life by finding his birth mother who had to give him up at birth because she was in prison what makes this film good is the fact that it is not overly melodramatic i was expecting something a little more like good will hunting with a lot of swearing fighting and vulgarity not that i did not like good will hunting or the swearing fighting and vulgarity of the film were out of place quite the contrary however antwone fisher is a true story and i do not think that washington wanted to sensationalize the story for dramatic affect in the film do not get me wrong there are moments when we see antwone fighting carrying on and having moments when it seems like the world is closing in on him after all in his first session with his psychiatrist the character played by washington devenport asks fisher where he was born and fishers response is from under a rock an obvious jab at the pressures waning on antwone fishers soul but i had to appreciate the fact that this film was not sensationalized for dramatic affect i think it shows real character on the part of denzel washington to deliver a more realistic story and to avoid the typical clichés that are common in hollywood films even those based on true stories one other point that i would like to bring up about antwone fisher is the acting over all performances were good in the film but not great at times i think it was a bit obvious that the main characters were actors but overall to complain about performances in this film would be ludicrous one actress that i would like to point out in this film is viola davis she plays antwones mother but she says barely two sentences in the movie at all but not so much because she appears at the end of the film but more because she in shock that her long lost son antwone has found her what i would like to point out about her as an actress in the lack of use of her she in basically a character actress and i have not seen her play any really elaborate roles she made appearances in traffic out of sight kate  leopold and two recent films far from heaven and solaris in steven soderbergs remake of solaris she played a scientist on a doomed space craft orbiting a planet in that film she is confronted by george clooneys character and she drawn to tears by what clooney tells her in a particular scene when i first saw solaris i remember seeing her tear up in the scene and thinking wow this woman can act it was as if you could feel the characters grief in that brief shot of her face she gave so much expression and i honestly felt very sorry for her characters sadness and trouble in the film i think she has definite potential as an actress and should be used more often perhaps in leading roles rather than just as a character driven actress nonetheless antwone fisher is a very good movie denzel washington as always pulls off a great performance and he gives us a great directorial debut also derek luke is a very talented actor i think that antwone fisher will bring his immense critical fame for his portrayal of the troubled man but i think that his public popularity will increase with the release of biker boyz which also stars lawrence fishburn antwone fisher is based on the book finding fish a memoir by antwone quenton fisher ,1
predictable parody just about failed to impress throughout it is looooooong eight minutes the only thing that made it worthwhile was the do not colorize line at the end credits shame something more entertaining was not put on the dvd like jonathan ross enjoyable profile of romero on the incredible strange film show,0
this movie is an amusing and utterly sarcastic view of pop culture and the producers thereof i was impressed with the photography that consisted of vivid colors and spin doctored settings especially when you think that this is zukovics first large scale attemptone warning do not take the movies message that seriously it is not for mass consumption  and that is not a compliment the message is a somewhat stylized postcollege neophyte view of societyi did enjoy the basic plot line of a fictitious zine editor verbally whipping the mobocracy of the ninetys,1
this movie was billed as a comedy and a mystery it fails badly at both the only mystery here is why would anybody make such a poorly constructed movie the only comedy is the laugh i got when i saw how high the readers here ranked it could there be two movies with the same name the movie i saw starred a girl with pretty blue eyes and a plot that was not there,0
okay now what the hell is this supposed to be is it a family fantasy movie to cash in further on the huge success of spielbergs close encounters of the third kind or a throwback to the glorious days of prehistoric epics such as when dinosaurs ruled the earth and the lost world perhaps it is an intellectual  philosophical masterpiece we all fail to comprehend yes that must be it whatever it is the creators of the day time ended good old john bud cardos of kingdom of the spiders and writer david schmoeller of tourist trap must have been sniffing quite a lot glue when they penned down the ideas for this demented hodgepodge of genres the story does not make the slightest bit of sense and the narrative structure is incoherent as hell but hey who cares as long as it is got papiermâché dinosaurs miniature spacecrafts headacheinducing light  laser shows and spontaneously combusting supernovas the voiceover introduction is practically inaudible but no worries as it is all gibberish did you know that the definition of time is not what we all think it is time does not necessarily pass by chronologically it is one giant paradox words that were spoken thousands of years ago are still floating around now and even things that will happen in the future are already surrounding us i have absolutely no idea what all this means but apparently it provides an easy excuse to gather tapdancing midget aliens and wellmannered dinosaurs on screen together i deliberately say wellmannered dinosaurs because at a certain point one of the prehistoric monsters politely knocks on the front door before menacing his targets the crazy plot revolves on a family of weirdos living in their solarpowered house in the middle of nowhere grandpa is extremely annoying the granddaughter even more granny is a walking  talking advertisement billboard for plastic surgery the youngest son strangely resembles prince valiant and the young mother is  incredibly hot chris mitchum for some reason also pointless wanders around the filming sets as the hot mommys husband on business travel the special effects are purely cheesy and absolutely laughable i sincerely hope that the other reviewer who talked about excellent special effects was being sarcastic but the absolute most genius aspect here are the dialogs just read this wondrous example of extraordinary writing grandpa you know what this is do not you this is a timespace warpstevie i am not quite sure if i know what that means dadgrandpa well i guess nobody really does make up your mind gramps do you know what it is or do not you and stop talking about the vortex like you are some kind of expert in the field the day time ended is an incredibly childish and notworthbotheringfor fantasy movie though i can totally understand that some of its fans cherish the film because they saw it at young age and became fascinated with the flamboyant effects the ending completely comes out of nowhere like they suddenly ran out of money or like the effects of the mushrooms they were eating wore out unexpectedly,0
i honestly do not understand how tripe like this gets made the worst juniorhigh talent show skit you have ever seen is more entertaining than this film will ferrells wrestling fetish provides the only briefly humorous moments utterly horrible,0
well it is yet again a film that plays with your sentiments and you come out all soft as opposed to a rocky film but i am a sucker for those so i gave it a good score the acting was very good and there were a lot of feeling the violence is kept to a minimal which makes a change i would have given it a nine if it were not for the salute at the end all in all a good movie with very good actors,1
this movie was absolutely ghastly i cannot fathom how this movie made it to production nothing against the cast of the movie of course this is all the fault of the writing team you take the old average plot  let us dance our way out of being poor and destitute  or step in this case but this one lacks any semblance of a true plot  or at least one that anyone would care about with canadian speaking actors in what is supposed to be an american setting  this film falls very flat on a positive note the directing was pretty good and cinematography was pretty decent as well looks like the production budget was very generous as well my only request is that this team leave the writing alone and go find actual screenwriters to help them bring words alive on film net result  how she move is how she sucks,0

being an elvis fan i cannot understand how this proyect could be done is by far the worst elvis related movie of all time totally unfunny silly and plenty of mistakes about the king come on elvis grave in a public park a mention about suspicious minds in one thousand nine hundred and fiftyeightand these are just two examples some people in the cast tries to do their best mike starr is funny specially as an impersonator the tom hanks cameo is a surprise but the guy playing the young elvis sucksoverall the movie lacks fun and becomes more boring minute after minute if you want to see an ultra cheap insane but absolutely funny little film related to elvis i truly recommend you bubba hotep instead of this mess,0
okay i am not going to critique this film in depth i note the many elogious reviews in advance of me and as i generally like maria de medeiros i have been long hesitant to make a disparaging comment  and in such fashion nearly a year has passed but each time i see that dvd on my shelf i sense an inner groan anyway let the elogious voices override me but for other cinephiles like me  bewareexpressed in simplest and gentlest terms here is my stancethe political turmoil and overthrow providing the backdrop for this film also served as a backdrop for a certain period of my life  via newspapers i read daily in my local middleeuropean pub at that time i followed the newsreports but never fully grasped what the heck was transpiring the reporters tended to report either in nonpartisan terms or with a conservatism which frowned upon any groups disturbing the peace or fomenting rebellion against the establishment those were times when other winds of unrest swirled through paris berlin prague and various places in the yous all of whose issues i understand clearly at the time  but dictatorship or not my papers tended to treat the govermentment of portugal simply as the establishment  not as a wellfleshed out evil empire to use flippant star war termsso week after week i read of disturbances but never found an intelligent editorial that might provide the history behind them or evaluate the practices and socialeconomic impacts of the dictatorship etcso in purchasing this film i had at least two hopes to finally understand the details leading up to the social unrest and to enjoy a wellconceived drama this film gave me neitherthe film presupposes that viewers already have ample knowledge and deep emotions regarding the historical facts and the drama  well as i said i want to encourage maria de medeiros and the portugues film industry but  it was trite and shallowi obtained my copy of the dvd from france  selection official cannes two thousand  un certain regard the box shows smiling cleanshaven actors the lead giving the victory sign in a fashion that reminds me more of the playboy bunny after seeing the work i wondered what the french could have thought of it  though as a shallow piece of cinema verite with sensitive ethnic content i can understand their natural inclination to praise it for its honesty butlook at the back of the box un regard chaleuruex sur la revolution  a warm regard try describing allendes overthrown and murder with a a warm regard try it with czechoslovakia in one thousand nine hundred and sixtyeight try it with the whole lineup of overthrows and civil rebellionsanother review maria de medeiros a renoue avec son pays son enfance et son histoire rubbish rubbish rubbish at least for mei love portugal in all of europe lisbon barcelona and prague are my favorite cities but my love for a city and a country does not flesh out a vacuous film i will hang on to my ancient vhs tapes of capas negras and a cancao de lisboa  meanwhile i am stuck with a zone two by the above title that might as well go in the trash,0
for those of you unfamiliar with jimmy stewart this is one of his lesser films from later in his career and while it is not a great film compared to many of his other pictures it is not bad and is a decent timepasserbut not much morekim novak is a witch in new york city and for some inexplicable reason she decides to cast a spell on poor jimmy to make him fall in love with her over time the cold and detached ms novak also begins to fall in love with stewartand apparently in the witchs rule book this is a definite no no the film is odd in its sensibilities about the witches they are neither the babysacrificing nor the allpowerful variety most of their magic is pretty limited and pointless such as jack lemmon using his powers to turn off street lamps and very oddly the witches all seem to be bohemians who hang out in hip bars where you might find people wearing berets and listening to crappy jazz considering what i think of jazz it must really stink to be a witch in this movies worldanyway the film is pretty romantic and mildly comedic but not something i would rush out to watch the acting is pretty good but the script does not offer enough payoff to make this an exceptional filmin fact i almost scored the film a sixit was really close,1
i bought this on dvd for my brother who is a big michelle pfeiffer fan i decided to watch it myself earlier this weekit is a reasonably entertaining piece containing two completely separate story lines the section with michelle pfeiffer was by far the more interesting of the two she plays a rising hollywood actress who has had many short unfulfilling relationships she literally bumps into brian kerwin a regular married guy with kidsafter driving her car into the back of his after being initially hostile to one another he offers to drive her home as she no longer feels comfortable to drive romance develops eventually leading to tragedy when his wife finds out what happens at the end i was not prepared for but the slow pacing and routine tv direction takes any drama out of the plotthe other section involves an old studio boss played by darren mcgavin this section actually has the better cast with kenneth mcmillan lois chiles steven bauer  stella stevens they all want something from the studio boss but in the end when he is asked to resign they all realize their careers will now be going nowhere it passes the time but is not all that interesting and i am glad this was not bought for me i am not a michelle pffeifer fan but she was admittedly the only actor worth watching in this film and even in one thousand nine hundred and eightythree she was a decent actress overall though unless you are a fan of hers avoid this as it is very routine,0
eddie murphys delirious is completely and totally rude crude crass and lude this is indeed the only way to describe this appalling trashy piece of standup eddie murphy goes for shock value rather than laughs to try and win his following over he does manage to be funny occasionally but mostly loses the plot with obscene language and distasteful sex jokesforget it unless you happen to enjoy eddies foul style i do not think i will bother with eddie murphy raw i much prefer eddie in the confines of a movie scriptsaturday january seventeen one thousand nine hundred and ninetyeight  video,0
i really looked forward to see planet of the apes but it was a huge dissapointmentthe settings and masks are great but that is the only good aspect of the film all other things are really annoying mark wahlberg is not acting he is just in the movie looking stupid the other actors are also not very goodbut the worst point of all is the story it is absolutely ridiculous for example the apes are lying unconsiousness on the ground but the humans dont attack them no they wait until they are up again this is just one example for the stupid story but it would take too long to tell them all,0
first off let me say that i am a great believer in fanpro stuff i see it as a way to continue a good show long after it has been cancelled star trek voyages and star wars revelations are examples of decent efforts so i have a softspot for fanpro stuff that means i will overlook things that i would ordinarily slate badlyso on to st hf well first off the good things enthusiasm is a major part of making any show believable and for the most part the crew of the various ships all seem to be having a good time with their roles next the effects are not bad for a homebrew effort with nothing to make you really wince the stories are not too bad either nothing particularly innovative but solid enough stuff and at least there are ongoing storyarcsbut it has a lot of faultsfirst off although they quite obviously have to ripoff star trek footage set backdrops music and effects i see no reason why they proceeded to rip off virtually every other scifi musical score ever made everything from aliens to starship troopers rears it orchestral head at one point or another likewise much of the footage is from other movies dutifully cgid over to make it look different the grey warships for instance though disguised are quite obviously star destroyers from star wars and the station is also rather obviously fleet battle station ticonderoga from starship troopers likewise sound effects from various star wars movies appear in space battles between fighters as does animated over footage in one scene in either first or second season i think you even see two tie fighters fly past during a battle which hardly does your suspension of disbelief any favoursacting varies from the reasonable to the hideously painful to watch everyone does improve as the seasons progress though but expect to grimace at the screen a lot especially in the early seasons they have also made some interesting acting choices let us just say that the food replicators on this show seem permanently set to cake and leave it at thatmakeup effects are generally quite effective on the whole but they really ought to mercilessly club to death the person who decided to use cheap ferengi and cardassian masks for anything other than background use or passing shots they are just beyond unrealistic every time i saw one of these apart from trying not to laugh too much i kept expecting the unfortunate soul wearing it to pull out a gun and announce that this is a stickup in one scene a cardassian actually talks whilst wearing one of these not only do the lips not move but the mask does not even have an opening where the mouth should be someone needs to be slapped hard for that could not they have taken a craft knife to it for goodness sake there are also some welldone but unintentionally funny makeup jobs such as the herman munster look alikethe writing though coherent is nothing new instead the script runs like a continuation of dsnine with the ships heading out from dstwelve on various missions the new enemy the grey are not very menacing and the plot line involving them is effectively a reworking of the borg threads ie starfleet meet the grey the grey are hugely powerful starfleet barely escape with their lives then through technology they begin to find ways to combat the enemy etc etc all done before with the borganother bone of contention is the dialogue star trek writers have long had the ability to write insert technobabble here into a script it usually means an exposition of the latest plan to combat the enemy using quantum phase discriminators or isolytic charges etc in other words nonsense that tells you that they are on the case and a resolution is at handthe words are just gibberish really i have no problem with this but where sthf makes a mess of it is where they include realworld comments into this concepttactical advice such as we need to regroup sounds good but not when uttered by trio of characters already standing in a group likewise when asked what the situation is a tactical officer is heard to reply we count three battleships he actually needed to count them cmon i expected the questioner to ask him are you sure or can you double check but my alltime favourite comment is this captain can we establish twoway communicationcomms officer no we can only send and receivewell duhhaving said all the above the show does improve as it goes along seasons one and two are pretty bad three shows an improvement but four  five are where it starts to get noticeably better season six so far looks quite reasonablei do have a problem with their choice of media for the shows though quicktime sucks quite frankly and the sooner they move to divxavi format the better some of us like to actually take our downloaded shows and watch them on decent size screen and not peer at a tiny qt window on a computer monitor not only does quicktime make this difficult but the three hundred and twentyxone hundred and eighty resolution the shows are in does not scale at all well in fact it makes the shows pretty unwatchable like they were a tenthgeneration vhs tape copy the least they could do was to include a hires downloadable optionanyway the show has promise and i am even beginning to like some of the characters but that is forty episodes on so i am not sure this says that much about character development at allbut what can you say it is freeps out of twentyeight votes nineteen people rated this show as a nine or ten hmmmm were we watching the same show or are you nineteen all three year olds,0
i just saw the movie on tv i really enjoyed it i like a good mystery and this one had me guessing up to the end sean connery did a good job i would recomend it to a friend,1
or listening to for that matter even the soundtrack is a bore honestly this is not the worst gay movie i have seen that would be regarding billy but it is down there very close to the bottom of the barrelthis thing drags and drags and drags it is not that the plot is inanein the hands of a good writer it might have worked    it certainly could have been much more entertaining there is not one plot point you cannot see coming for ten miles down the road the dialog is flat the jokes are old to add insult to injury it is full of onedimensional stereotypical gays nothing in this movie convinced me that the situation or the relationship of the two leads was possible much less real there was no chemistry no dynamic in fact no evidence of why the leads love each other    we are just told they are in love hard to figure when they have nothing in common and are not compatible sexually they like the same book huhthe acting is not totally bad but the pacing is excruciatingly slow i mean almost jarmusch slow but without jarmusch quality in fact that would be a good barometer for you if you like jarmusch films avoid this one,0
this series got me into deightons writing and the genre when i was younger and i love this presentation of the story i would however disagree with the above comment from what i have read in the past it is not holms performance that lead deighton to refuse to have the series released but the butchering that all three books received in the translation to the screen a great example of this is the rewrite of the boarder crossing that ended samsons field career the scene is not in the book the character who dies in the minefield was never in any of the books and the crossing in sinker was from east germany to west germany not the polish frontier this whole storyline is cloth the changes in set similarly damage the integrity of the story my perspective on holms performance was that he portrayed the disorientation of samson during his wifes defection excellently and i believe comported himself well in portraying the aging field agent desperately trying to bridge the class divide samson both pays for his fathers idealism and suffers due to its influence on his life as clevemore comments had he gotten himself an education he would have probably been running the department i think the true loss of performance is due to physical appearance more than anything holm is diminutive when compared to the samson of the book  a physically impressive man capable of using his size to impose a presence,1
i am a jean harlow fan because she had star quality i do not think her movies are good and i do not even think that she was a good actress but she certainly was great in comedies every bit of comedy in the girl from missouri is very good but this movie is perhaps more like a love story jean harlow is wonderful in this one and you can forget the rest of the cast  their performances bring nothing new it always impresses me much to think that harlows beautiful body was that of an ill woman well in this movie she does look beautiful,0
you know those films that have you trapped in the cinema you are stuck there in the best seat in the house centre of the row in your own special sweet spot that you swapped three times before you got just the right seat  and after about what feels like thirteen hours you are still trapped there uncomfortable and itchy thinking when the f is this film ever going to end you know the feeling  think of ai and the villagewell visitor q delivers a weird variant of that feeling i sat there for the first thirty minutes wondering when the thing was going to fing start it is interminable so arty it hurts this is the first miike takashi film i have watched apparently he makes films by the dozen and if they are all pretentious wnk like this i suspect it will be the lasti am not against pretentious wnk david lynch is up there amongst the top ten directors for me but visitor q is cutrate cheap and nasty pretentious wnk as you may have worked out by now  i hated it,0
yes definitely better than my viewing of death tunnel actually some of the deaths were pretty original and the gore was decent it was kind of like wrong turn meets the hills have eyesbut one when the kids high school or college are discussing horror movies in the kitchen everything shae says is almost an exact quote from scream one thousand nine hundred and ninetysix the thing about the bigbreasted girls etctwo was steve not a bootleg randy from scream three besides the fact that it took place in october what the hell did the movie have to do with samhain pretty unnecessary if you ask me i find it humorous when i see those horror movies from the eightys that explain away loose ends by pointing the fingers at the druids or a pentagramfour wow they made a sam raimi reference five why was gary and his sister in the movie they are characters had nothing to do with anything and hes so psychic that he could not even see his own death six when gary was being killed in the bathroom at that point the deaths became simply tromalicious how could she hear the screams when she was downstairs but not hear them when she was standing outside the door seven garys sister commented on haggis that is primarily a scottish dish not irisheight so the lesson is if you are like shae and do not have any fun or crack a smile through the whole film you will be the one to live nine the mutants were pretty cool but they looked like walking dishes of chili con carneten when they brought in garys sister did they forget that steve had been strapped there and wonder where he went eleven was there not more than one killer shae beat that one but never encountered any more of themtwelve what was with the flashbacks to those other people half of them shae did not know if they were dead or alive so what was with that thirteen why did not they kill gary and his sister before fourteen why did no one ever call the police and apparently everybody knew those people lived in the woods why did they never organize some kind of raid fifteenas far as i know they were not zombies or vampires so how could she turn into one at the end i am with everyone else on the giant huh at the endway better than death tunnel but still quite sloppy i still do not understand why they even placed it in ireland considering samhain had close to nothing to do with the plot,0
actually goldie hawn is from washington takoma park maryland but i digress this is sort of a mr smith goes to washington type of movie with some variations but the same premise i taped this movie off of cable years ago because i had a huge crush on goldie hawn the story is interesting but it is highly unlikely that some cocktail waitress will get an important job in the government just because she saved some big shots life it made me laugh and made me mad at the same time it made me laugh because some of the situations she found herself in were so ridiculous i had to laugh possible spoiler ahead it made me mad to think that our government would set up an average citizen in the manner she was set up and the speech she made at the endbeautiful too bad not many people have guts like that in real life,1
this flick reminded me of those lame erotic thrillers i used to stay up late and watch on cinemax when i was thirteen i would label this flick softercore since there is just no simulated bump and grinder there is however a ton of nudity the opening scene is in a strip club we see kane hodders keester or at least a stunt butt and then an inexplicable ten minute lesbian dance scene in the middle of the film and a nude female werewolf who looks like they mugged on of the munsters for a costume thirteen year old boys rejoiceother than that the werewolf transformation scenes have the worst cgi i have seen in years the shots look like fmvs from the video game resident evil in terms of quality the wolf is too bad to be explained and despite the poor quality of the suit is shown way way too many timesthe plot and acting make no sense there is some oddball back story about werewolves and hybridwerewolves the darkwolf is the latter but from what i can tell hybrids do the same thing all werewolves do look human change to a wolf an kill people the darkwolf is trying to find a mate but oddly cannot find the mate but can sniff out anyone she touches once more this skills proves less than useful since the darkwolf winds up killing several folks his target never touched met or even saw as best i can tell the mate does not know she is a werewolf and she is fighting the transformation or somethingyou would think it would be hard to mess up a simple monster movie s bad as this but well they did want quality lowend werewolfism go rent dog soldiers want a ton of ta this is your flick,0
wow how bad can it get this was seriously bad not in terms of the gore  which was mainly laughable cgi  but in acting atmosphere and directionthe story was dreadful  the character arc of the main lead was a total joke within a few nights of stalking vinnie jones he starts to become haunted to the point of crying when photographing his girlfriend um are all new york photographers this childish suggestible and weak his character development had absolutely no justification or point whatsoever  and by the very end you will be laughing out loud at the utterly predictable and totally absurd twist his character takesthe gory moments were clearly just a weak lowselfesteemed effort to jump onto the modern mtv style gore wagon  all cgi blood yet no real emotion whatsoever these parts were unintentionally funny  and distracting by their selfconsciousness  wacky camera angles etcoverall this film commits the crime of blowing another potential idea what could have had atmosphere until the stupid monsters at the end is ruined in favour of look at mestyle selfconscious directing this film was not made for and audience  it was made for a cv  a deeply selfish motive,0

the return of chandu is notable if one can say that for the casting of bela lugosi as the hero rather than the villain why he even gets the girl the story as such involves the black magic cult of ubasti trying to capture the last egyptian princess nadji the delectable maria alba and use her as a sacrifice as a means of reviving their ancient leader who just happens to look like nadji lugosi as chandu who possesses magical powers tries to thwart the villains director ray taylor does his best with limited resources and extensive stock footage fans of king kong one thousand nine hundred and thirtythree will recognize the giant doors that were used to keep kong at bay in several scenes the acting is for the most part awful the actor who plays the high priest i believe lucien prival for example uses that acting coach inspired pronunciation that was so common in the early talkies the less said about the others the better it is a mystery why lugosi accepted parts in independent quickies at this stage of his career because he was still a bankable star at universal at this time maybe it was because in this case he got to play the hero and get the girl who knows as his career started to spiral downwards in the late thirtys this kind of fare would become the norm for lugosi rather than the exception,0
i am still trying to figure out if there was a point to this filmfor content that is supposed to be so rebellious and controversial the things that maddox distributes to the students are awfully lame students seem to be easily swayed by vague antiauthoritarian sentiments and snippets of words illegibly scrawled onto leaflets rebel everybodyi suppose it would have been too much to ask to have a teenage rebellion film where a school fire alarm does not get set offapparently a huge fight up on the football fields is a fight that consists of two peoplecharacters personalities seem to wildly vary at random a football jock who maddox was fighting and who subsequently got a staple on the face is all smiles and apologies the next daythe fact that it does not come to any real conclusion of the plot makes me feel that the whole thing could have been fitted into a half hour after school special if they had cut most of the attempted pseudoglitch soundtrack,0
without a doubt private lessons ii is the greatest movie i have ever seen a japanese import poorly translated into english its a joy to watch not much of it makes sense but that does not matter it is the greatest comedy around without ever being intentionally funnythe film is rare and unavailable on video but i have caught it a couple of time late late at night on pay cable my taped copy has been watched dozens and dozens of times as i slowly personbyperson introduce this film gem to the worldjoanna pacula plays the tutorlover to ken our hero she apparently was just working for her check ken is played by goro inagaki of the japanese pop band smap who gives it his all and has great hair through out the movie stacy edwards of in the company of men fame shows up in the movie too and is probably happy that she found other film work afterwardsit takes at least three viewings to sorta figure out what the plot is on repeating viewing you can enjoy elements like the abnormal amount of vases ken has in his house at least fifty or that ken is wearing a shirt with embroidered husks of corn in the movies finalethe movie is predictable but highly quotable my friends and i reenact entire scenes yes it sounds like we are lame losers and we are  but we are lame losers who have seen private lessons ii be one of ten people in the world who have seen this movie you will thank me for it,1
i hope the viewer who regards dream machine as one of corey haims finest and the best movies of the century was kidding undetected sarcasm on my part i sincerely hope sothe dream machine marks the first of a long line of mediocre capers that would plague the rest of corey haims career except prayer of the rollerboys which was surprisingly decent here haim plays nonchalant college boy bernie who supposes that a cool car will attract his dream girls attention lucky for bernie a rich woman aiming to get back at her cheating husband hastily decides to reward her faithful piano tunerberniewith a gift a slick porsche turbo however unbeknownst to the woman and unfortunate for bernie is that her dead husband was murdered and his body was hidden in the trunk now being that in this movie bodies do not seem to decay or possess a rather foul funk bernie is unaware of this in fact the oblivious boy has no idea that something suspicious is afoot despite several odd circumstances that arise in particular a grizzly man follows him around desperate to get hold of that body relatively undetectedthis is a lowgrade action fizzle as many of haims films like this are see the double o kid despite being part action part romantic comedy this movie fails to offer the viewer much of anything of interest for at least the first fortyfive minutes in which the filmmakers take more than enough time to show the immediate problem ie bernie being in possession of a car and a dead body and a hitman finding out that the porsche is going to be hard to find after which and thanks to poor acting by haim i loved this kid too but it is not exactly sacrilegious to admit the times when he obviously could not act well and the lack of real immediacy and emergency between bernie and the villain that makes much of the events unconvincing and as a result inappreciable to add injury to insult the soundtrack was unbelievably laughable and sounded more like selfevident songs you would hear in team america see the date montageloyal corey haim fans however should not be disappointed to see their boy in abundance however others understanding that haims career probably peaked when he was fourteen or fifteen and never recovered might expect mediocrity as will viewers just looking for early ninetys bcomedy fluff to pass the time,0
to put it simply i am not fond of westerns and having never sat through one from beginning to end i decided to watch my darling clementine and see it all the way through no matter how painful it was for me at first it was excruciating as expected i found the acting to be laughable the scenery your standard dessert horses and cowboys boring and the music and its timing teetering on the edge of painful however after mentally pep talking myself to struggle on after the first twenty minutes it began to be quite a bit easier for me to endure focusing in on the cinematography and how john ford managed to make even the dullest situations dull according to me that is look quite stunning at times made it a lot more interesting in conclusion i cannot go so far as to say that i enjoyed the movie by the end of it however it was made well enough for me to sit all the way through to the very end and that in itself impresses me,0
look it is eva longoria and paul rudd in a movie about a dead girlfriend haunting the new girlfriend it is gabrielle from desperate housewives and the guy who wore sex panther cologne in anchorman if you are expecting a golden globe nominated movie then you need to rethink how you look at movies however if you are willing to suspend reality for ninety minutes and want to watch a funny movie then you have come to the right place the characters are all funny they work together very well the real match up is paul rudd and lake bell he is as funny as he was on friends and she was funny and good looking all at the same time i went with my wife she enjoyed it and so did i,1
famous was famous for their tension and release style of cartoon where the semimain character is in terrible peril only to be rescued by the hero at the last second this particular casper is the only one i can remember where death actually takes a hand but even in death there is still a happy endingthe constant in famous studios cartoons is that virtue always triumphs popeye always gets to his spinach in time baby huey always outfoxes the fox little audery always learns her lesson and some fs cartoons are really dark and depressingyou have to give them credit as much as i love looney tunes and tom and jerry i do not think anyone was putting out a better cartoon product at that time than paramount color animation music the great winston sharples editing voices they were consistent and a glowing example of the best that the art form had to offer,1
in todays world of digital fabrication there is no computer than can replace the actor and writer alas this type of character driven film is far too rare these days duvalls performance as well as james earl jones are faithful to their audiences high expectations i wonder if this movie was made for tv it has a closeup personal quality to the narrative it is an understatement to say that the performances are all outstanding the only thing that keeps it from being a cinema masterpiece is the lack of a great cinematographer but pretty pictures are not everything how can talent the likes of jones and duvall continue to produce such fine work in an age where actors pose for the digitizing,1
a beautiful movie especially if you like horseswwii films and the austere hungarian plateaua story of courage compassion and loyalty that transcends generations the horsemanship is spectacular as well as the main characters horse in his own trainingi will buy this movie and watch it again this is a family film and i recommend it highlya good family nite movie although there are some violent scenes it was the nazi occupation of hungarythe native people were very interesting in the way they stood their ground even in the face of certain death from a nazi officer who had his own personal reasons for hunting down bradya hauntingly beautiful film,1

the dazzling seventeenminute dance sequence of george gershwins one thousand nine hundred and twentyeight orchestral piece an american in paris is an indisputable masterwork choreographed with precision and unparalleled flair by gene kelly the vibrant combination of color music and dance is still eyepoppingly startling as the piece is broken down into scenes inspired by selected master artists  dufy in the opening place de la concorde piece manet in the flower market utrillo in a paris street rousseau at the fair vincent van gogh in the spectacular place de lopera piece and toulouselautrec for the moulin rouge where kelly wears his famous white bodysuit the ninetyseven minutes that precede this finale are not as exciting not by a long shot but there are certain charms to be had in viewing the entire one thousand nine hundred and fiftyone oscarwinning musicaldirector vincente minnelli and screenwriter alan jay lerner have fashioned a surprisingly sophisticated if rather slight romantic story focused on jerry mulligan a former gi who has remained in paris after the end of wwii trying to make a living as a painter with his braggadocio manner and athletic dancing style gene kelly can be concurrently ingratiating and irritating as a screen personality but he seems to find his oeuvre as the carefree jerry the lovetriangle plot is focused on jerrys involvement with milo roberts a selfproclaimed art patron but a sexual predator when it comes to young artists on their first date in a crowded montmartre nightclub jerry unapologetically falls for lise a young woman who turns out to be the fiancée of henri a professional entertainer and friend of jerrys pal adam an outofwork concert pianist romantic complications ensue until the inevitable ending but not before several classic gershwin songs are performedthe best of these is the most imitated  a swooningly romantic song and dance to our love is here to stay along a fauxseine river in a blue hazy mist with yellow fog lights the way kelly and leslie caron circle each other is transcendent as they approach each other tentatively at first and then synchronize beautifully to the music leading to the final clinch few films have so elegantly and succinctly shown two people falling in love i got rhythm and swonderful spotlight kellys nimble tapdancing and agreeable singing while embraceable you is danced impressively by caron in a fivescene montage of henris alloverthemap description of lise to adam designed to show off carons dancing versatility the sequence is similar to the one in on the town where veraellen showed off her considerable dancing skills when kellys sailor character described his multifaceted vision of miss turnstilesas lise the nineteen yearold caron in her first film dances superbly throughout and handles her role with unformed charm with her acting talent not to bloom for several years looking quite glamorous nina foch plays older as the manipulative milo and manages to be likable enough for us to care about her fate while oscar levant is just his sardonic self as adam performing an elegant i will build a stairway to paradise george guétary plays henri so agreeably that you feel bad that he does lose the girl at the end this is not the best allaround mgm musical but there is certainly enough movie magic to make this quite worthwhile the two thousand dvd contains a fairly pristine print but little else in terms of extras,1
short but long enough cat soup is a very wild trip to watch one day i was just searching though my ondemand list through the anime section and came across it and decided to watch it i spent the whole time basically sitting with my jaw agape the whole time i was either vacant of thought or had a fleeting one which screamed turn it off but i did not and actually i am glad i didthe animation is stunning very artistic odd and dark i personally loved it for the amazing animation but the seemingly vacant story behind it is equally compelling for myselfa young boywell catgoes in search of his sisters soul in the first part she is lying sick in bed and is soon paid by a visit from a sort of grim reaper her soul is split in half one is regained by the cat boy while the other half is lostthen the rest of the film is slightly lost to me honestly i expect they go back and their world is perhaps slowly falling apart maybe her absence of soul is the answer behind this for the rest of the film contains various stages of which the worlds in first there is a giant flood and next it dries up into a bleak desert and then everything freezes thanks to either what is god or fate as you will see then i believe they find the sisters soul in the form of an orange flower after that the whole world disappears haha totally did not get that but it sends shivers down my spine each timedespite it is seemingly random scenes i am sure there is a deeper message behind it if you watch it enough and do some research personally i love trippy stuff like this and would love to spend time doing that just to understand it but to some people it is probably not their cup of tea it comes off as highly disturbing so if you like your straight forward anime this is not a film for you if you have an open mind however i highly recommend this movie,1
holy crap this movie was bad i watched it just as a joke it is not even so bad that it is good in an unintentional way this film seemed to be designed to personally make me angry it worked really well at doing that it is as if the people who made this just took all of the really annoying stuff about the movie priest added in a bunch of ugly dudes took out anything interesting funny or even remotely sexy and clever out of the concoction and then added in a bunch of old rotten cheese that is all this is cheese there is not a single person this film could possibly connect to there is not any universe this film could possibly take place in why cannot a film like this just be about enjoying life and being happy why did they have to make this already stupid idea for a film even more ridiculous than it already is why could not they at least even tried to make it an okay film or even a bmovie now that i think of it what they hell were they trying to do with this film i watched it expecting a campy love story and instead i got some boring student project about some idiot who has to find the strength and courage to marry his boyfriend while his annoying christian brother tried to destroy it all no i am not joking that is what it is about does that sound good this film is pretty ignorant against people of the christan religion with it is stereotyping of all christians being loudmouthed rude and hellbent on making as many people as miserable as possible a lot of christian people i know would never speak or act like these freaks the film however is just as unfair and ignorant to the gay community as well these have got to be the most tastelessly crafted stereotypical gay men since the guy on the radio station on that roadkill video game it is so nerve wracking and simply irritating to the point that i was not able to fully pay attention to this film the makers of this trainwreck had no strategy for set design acting camera angles lighting script authenticity or an idea to make this entertaining or interesting there is not even a single sex scene or at least not a believable one jamie brett gabel was the only guy in the film that looked any good at all but his good looks were sadly put to waste this is trash in a perfect world this film would get voted a zerozero it is worth zero as a film alone a mentally handicapped nun who is blind deaf and has tiny little bones for arms and legs and whose face is located on her armpit could write direct and produce a better film and she would probably be a better actor as well the fact that this film exists is a crime against the word film itself this film is so bad that other films should be ashamed of being available in the same watchable format i could put a broom in a chair and then record it with a camera and then stop the film and then replace it with a mini xmas tree and then record that and i have already made a film that will always be better than ben  arthur by at least half there are only two things worse than death torture and watching ben  arthur i am a homosexual and i will probably be the gayest person you will ever meet if you ever met me and i do not think i have ever been more offended by an entire film than i was by the first five seconds of this film alone if this movie was a mistake i will personally find a way to change the famous phrase it is okay to make mistakes to it is okay to make mistakes unless that mistake was ben  arthur you know how people always say things like good things come out of everything i think that ben  arthur was primarily invented so that there could be something on this earth that nothing good would ever come out of to call this movie the worst movie i have ever seen would be giving it way too much credit it is as if this film were designed just so that it could qualify in a category of it is very own there are good movies there are bad movies and then there is ben  arthur this is ben and arthur,0
when i first saw this film in the one thousand nine hundred and eightys i was in my middle teenage years and somewhat reluctant to see this since i considered myself grown up and out of the sesame streetmuppets age i honestly do not remember if i liked it at the time or not however somewhere in college i watched this film again and it wound up going and staying into my personal best films ever collectionthis film is loaded with humor that goes far above and beyond what one would have expected from the muppets i mean obviously the muppets always have appealed to adults and children because there is humor geared towards both generations but come onjanice is accidentally overheard telling someone i do not take my clothes off for anyone even if it is artisticthere is a joke from a father to a son that if the son in love with kermit the frog then the father does not want to hear itgonzo saves a chicken with mouthtomouth resuscitation sp and afterwards says i think we are engaged nowthese and plenty of other moments in the film had me rolling add to that very smart dialogue very smart new yorkbroadway wink wink humor the usual large amount of celebrity cameos and some really enjoyable songs that do not border on kidlevel cheesy whatsoeverthis film is a masterpiece i do not throw tens out on a regular basisbut this one deserves it over twenty years later this film totally holds up perhaps even more so the muppets never were and never will be again as funny and smart and just plain brilliant as this film was and is q,1
this is a terrible film and not one scene has an ounce of truthful emotion the characters are uninflected obviously drawn predictable and the story line is obvious and typical hollywood wish fulfillmentwilliam holden so sad to see him in this role was fiftyfive when this film was made but he is playing someone in his early fortys and looks like he is in his sixtys kay lenz was twenty and was scripted to find him irresistibly attractive i think the dog they found by the side of the road was sexier and had more life than their erotic connectionholdens characterthe same age as clint eastwood when he directed this film not coincidentallyis placed with obvious trappings of sixtys prehippie cool the bachelor pad the swinging hifi the lunches at yamashiro but the film is ridiculously uncool a clanging claptrap of old fogies desperately wishing that the free spirits they saw on sunset and in laurel canyon would find them and their big honkin cars sexyugh youth culture was never that desperate and i shudder to think that bill holden was so desperate for youth that he took this embarrassing part,0
this is a sprawling four hours remake of the rider haggard story with the usual added female and an extraneous subplot with russian soldiers seeking a stone of power buried along with the treasure of king solomon it is very well shot giving a vivid sense of the wide open spaces of africa and very well acted patrick swayze is an excellent alan quatermain and allison doody is attractive as elizabeth maitland who hires quatermain to help rescue her father sidede onyulo as umbopa gavin hood as mcnabb and the leader of the russian soldiers not named in imdbs listing are also memorable for all that hollywood cannot leave a good story alone when they adapt it this one is well told and except that it is too long i enjoyed it sixten,1
this movie had a imdb rating of eightone so i expected much more from it it starts out funny and endearing with an energy that feels spontaneous but before the movie is halfway through it begins to drag and everything becomes sickingly predictable the characters in the office were delightful in the first third of the movie but we get to know them a little too well they become caricatures not real people at all this is the same story i have seen hundreds of times only told here with slightly different circumstances the thing is i could stomach another predictable love story if only the dialog were not so stalethe only thing that could be worse is if the characters had inconsistent and unbelievable motivations and unfortunately that was also the case with dead letter office hopefully this movie will end up in the dead movie office soon,0
the movie remains in the gray for far too long very little gets explained as the movie progresses with as a result lots of weird sequences that seem to have a deeper meaning but because of the way of storytelling they become only just weird and not understandable to watch it sort of forces you to watch the movie again but no way i am going to do that it is that i watched this movie in the morning i am sure of it that if i watched this movie in the evening i would had fallen asleep to me the movie was like a poor mans blade runnerthe movie leaves far too many questions and improbabilities it makes the movie leave a pointless and nonlasting impressionalso the weird look of the movie does not help much the movie is halve cgihalve real life but it is not done halve as good impressive spectacular and imaginative as for instance would be the case in later movies such as sin city and three hundred they even created halve of the characters of the movie by computer which seemed like a very pointless and odd choice also considering that the character animation is not too impressive looking sure the futuristic environment is still good looking and the movie obviously was not cheap to make but its style over substance and in this case that really is not a positive thing to saysome of the lines are also absolutely horrendous and uninteresting the main god of the movie constantly says lines such as i am going to do this but it is none of your concern why i want to do it than just do not say anything at all mr horus it is irritating and a really easy thing to put in movie if you do not care to explain anything about the plot also the deeper questions and meanings of the movie gets muddled in the drivel of the movie and its scriptthe actors still did their very best they seemed like they believed in the project and were sure of it that what they were making would be something special so i cannot say anything negative about themthe story and movie is far from original it ripoffs from a lot of classic and semiclassic mostly modern sciencefiction movies it perhaps is also the reason why the movie made a very redundant impression on mea failed and uninteresting movie experimentthreeten,0
of all the movies i have seen this one rates almost at the bottom haunted mansion nothing but trouble and a few others keep it from reaching rock bottom it is hasty the story is shaky and the events depicted are poorly acted of course we have to lay some of this at the book writers door the book the movie was filmed after is outrageously ponderous and illogical oprah gives a palatable appearance as biggers mom but is not nearly at her potential other famous performers also seem to be at their worst the plot which centers around an african american who decided to take a job as a chauffeur in driving the family daughter to a communist dinner he becomes acquainted one thing leads to another and the girl gets drunk now the family he is working for are not against blacks but he thinks they are so when he comes home he puts her to bed but she begins caterwauling the blind mother yes hears this so bigger tries to silence her but instead smothers her now fearing he is really in trouble for killing a white girl he does what any logical thinking man would dohe shoves her into the coal furnace so investigators are carrying out a missing person case and lo they check the furnace the idiot did not have the foresight to get rid of the ashes he is then arrested and the last hour or so are obnoxious segments from the courtroom if your desperate for a bad movie this one could do the job but if you seriously want to learn about culture issues in th fortys and fiftys or see a good drama there are a lot better options avoid this,0
this was just a terrible movie it hurt me to watch it almost every action was unmotivated within the context of the movie the acting was really poor pdiddy was the best actor which really says something about the movie and the plot was generally predictable some links to carlitos way were okay for example his dream of one day moving to the carribien but on the whole they were weak the love interest in my opinion was flat out wrong but hey that is debatable anyways i really was not expecting much before watching the movie and i guess you could say even those expectations were not met i feel bad for jay hernandez because he actually is a decent actor friday night lights he is lucky though because i am sure there will not be too many people watching this movie i generally give movies a decent rating if they spark my interest at all so i am going to go ahead and give this one two stars better luck next time and yes i did enjoy carlitos way,0
i am a big mark for the music of neil young and with that and the glowing praise the film received in many altindie press circles hit the first showing of greendale i could find my excitement was shortlived as this turgid storyline and weak lyrical momentum left most filmgoers either asleep or disappointedneil says the film started as a soundtrack and the characters came to life so much that they just filmed the soundtrack not the best way to craft a story no character really has an arc and when significant events do happen the viewer does not cared because film technique annoyance levels are so high by that point the film is all song and to that end the characters on end mouth the lyrics as they are sungthe technique works for the first stanza it is done and is grating on the nerves after that it does not feel real or fake it just feels unwelcometerrible acting with characters finding one mood and playing all of it poor lighting at times the only kudos i can give the film are in regard to several scenes shot as newscast but the technique is so used in cinema today that this film did little to further it an alright soundtrack but nothing i am quick to buy a bad film,0
i thought that for a first episode of a first series it did really well it was really fun and i thought the actors was brilliant i think it is a crime for anyone to say that is was bad because it looked the right time i find it really annoying when people say that it was not historically correct because it is supposed to be a saturday night entertainment show not a boring history documentary so i think the costumes and settings were just right a brilliant start and i am going to love what will come next i have spoken to many people at my school and they love the show we all think that it is brilliant entertainment and it has great stories to go with it,1
i rented this movie this past weekend cranked up the surround sound system and got some great sound from special affects this movie is a great movie rental the special affects where enough to scare my fiance but i noticed some looked suprisingly computer generated i did not go to the movies and see this but its a scary late night do not feel like going out movie i would recommend it,1

based on an actual mining disaster this early german talkie with english subtitles still remains one of the most effective docudramas ever filmed featuring many nonprofessional actors kameradschaft gives a chilling view of the friendship that binds the mine workers regardless of which side of the frenchgerman border they may be from a deadly accident brings out the very best in everyone nullifying any superiors orders a fellow miner in need will receive the help of his comrades even at threat of great loss including lifethis film reminds of the selfsacrificing heroism shown by the nyfd following the nineeleven attacks putting aside any formal rules and regulations these men and women in uniform knew only one because to save lives and to find their fellowfire fighters  more than seventy years later kameradschaft still has the strong and timeless message a friend in need is a friend in deed,1
i have seen this film several times in a variety of shortfilm festivals and it always causes me the impression that i have seen a movie trailer for a schoolfilm is very well produced and directed but the story well it needed something else to be a bigger and interesting film the character named tim watcher needed some indept approach this is something that lacks in some portuguese short films  the script is always superficialbut still i liked this movieparabens congratulations,0
critically people say that antz is better antz is a good film but i enjoyed bugs life a bit more i cannot remember a pixar animation other than the two toy story films that i was laughing so hard the animation is clean the story is original and does not preach the voice overs are what make this movie dave foley is an earnest ant that gets himself into trouble a lot hopper is a superb characterisation by the always wonderful kevin spacey as is haydn panettiere as dot  there is also sterling support from dennis leary david hyde pierce and madeline kahn and i could go on and on the script is fantastic so funny and sometimes even touching it lacks the social messages of antz but what we have is rocksolid entertainment nineten bethany cox,1
jason lees pecks are back if that is what you are looking for look no further if not better move onbut about the movie clichés galore some poorly shot but kind of exotic fight scenes used jkd and lots of bad acting  cheap effects poor lee looks like he is in pain throughout the movie and no wonder not a pleasant comebackthe movie does not even cut it as a bmovie  sure there was a germanish bleached blonde rutgerwannabe bad guy but no gratuitous sex scene or even a single booty shots none zip nada even in starship troopers two they had the common sense to include the mandatory nudie scenes as for rest of my comments on that excellent piece of classic cinema excellence please refer to our upcoming review on that mindblowing sequel i did get the feeling that the writer was taking his revenge on somebody with this  thus i will not get into the plot of the movie or pretty much anything else related except that it did have some nonheterosexual overtones so nuff saidhowever this movie has one thing going for it  no jeanclaude ,0
first of all write the script on a napkin who needs more than that after all we are not a hollywood filmthen get amateur actors it will be good for the festival hype after all who needs people who have spent years honing their craft then hire a cinematographer who does not know how to light you see if it is welllit it will not look real and the festival people will not like it who needs to have professional level photography anyway then hire a tenyear old who has never held a camera to be your operator it will give your movie that completely amateurish touch that festival screeners will mistake for reality and guarantee that even though you will empty the seats from real people critics and a small sliver of the audience who overintellectualize will scream genius because they will not believe this was just complete amateurhouronce you have done that buy your ticket to the festival of bad movies aka sundancewhat a sad waste,0
michael rooker is a decent actor but he has no business being the lead except in a low budget movie he really does not have much charisma ryo ishibashi has a lot more screen presence and sadly he is not really the main character most of the screen time goes to the brickfaced rookerdanielle harris from the halloween four and five movies plays his daughter and she is cute and entertaining but she is written as not being too smart and one of her dumb mistakes gets one of the main characters killed comedians fred willard bobcat goldthwait and stephen furst are here in interesting roles just watching what happens to these characters is priceless vincent schiavelli plays the consigliare to the local mafia godfather and it is hard to tell whether or not he is working the movie as a comedy tim thomerson is also in this movie he seems to be in every extremely low budget directtovideo action movie thomerson is also in some lowbudget comedies seeing so many comedians and comic actors in this film made it feel like a spoof is it a parody of a yakuza movie it is hard to tell at some points there is certainly very little yakuza action the supporting cast of thugs and goons is menacing and well cast some of these kinds of movies have thugs that look like they work at the local comic book store or as stock boys at pigglywiggly overall this movie is very uneven at some points it seems like a comedy or a parody then at other points it works as a good action movie then it sputters to an end without the contributions of danielle harris and ryo ishibashi this movie would rate a zero in my humble opinion,0
it was almost unfathomable to me that this film would be a bust but i was indeed disappointed having been a connoisseur of pekinpah cinema for years i found this dvd drastically reduced for sale and thought it was worth a shot the opening few credits iconic to pekinpah fans has the intercutting between man and animal but here we have nondiegetic ambient noise of children playing in a schoolyard while a bomb is being planted fantastic suspense then when the perps caan and duval travel to their next mission duval drops the bomb on cann that his date last night had an std found only by snooping through her purse while cann was being intimate with her the ensuing laughter is fantastic and is clearly paid homage to in brian depalmas dressed to kill at the shortlived expense of angle dickenson the problem with the killer elite is that after the opening credits the film falls flat even bring me the head of alfredo garcia has stronger production value a bold call for anyone who knows what i am talking about i use pekinpahs credits as supplementary lecture material but once they are finished turn the killer elite off,0
greetings again from the darkness this one will be compared to the princess bride and although it does not measure up to that classic it is extremely entertaining and well made in its own right the story line is a bit odd and the whole wall thing is never really explained but the execution is fine even building up strong suspensecharlie cox plays tristan who falls for the wrong girl sienna miller and agrees to fetch her a fallen star  who happens to be played by the stunning claire danes not much suspense on what happens with these two but the suspenseful part comes in with the wicked witch played by michelle pfeiffer and the prince son of king peter otoole looking to reclaim the ruby necklace our star is wearing lots of bad chasing the goodalong the way an encounter with the strangest pirate you will see including any from the carribbean robert deniro plays captain shakespeare  tough on the inside and shall we say in touch with his feminine side another encounter involves the brilliant ricky gervais as a fast talking trader and that is good for a couple of laughsnot your typical chase coming of age or fantasy film but director matthew vaughns layer cake effort deserves an audience sadly the poor marketing campaign will probably prevent it from making any money my guess it will find big success on video,1
i had to endure teenaged high school angst and family conflict for almost all of the show i really do not care about highschool girls fretting about their relationships i have spent my time in hell dealing with such issues and i care nothing about fictional teenies going through lite versions of the horrors i endured i want science fiction that is the only reason i am here there were a few seconds of science fiction late in the show we finally see a protocylon it was good but with one problem its red eyedot would lock onto an object of interest we all know that cylon eyedots always scan back and forth giving the machine a map of the world the red eyedot does not ever stop moving back and forthi really hope the writers fix this abuse before the second episode,0
pathetic this is what happens when director comes to work just because someone is paying him to the intentions were good great locations and settings for a film of epic proportions but the performance damn i swear in some shots you can see extras on the background staring in the camera or looking at the actors because no one told them what they should do when they hear action the battle scenes are so bad you wonder  are these people for real they could have done more damage just by hugging each other in the slowmo scenes you can see people on battle field walking around or just standing waving their hands only action in the foreground is somehow emphasized but for what the story is so illogical and discontinuous it seems like random situations in chronological order sometimes not even that the dialogs are dumb the love plot is more embarrassing and ridiculous than in hong kong action movies with a budget of forty million and you can see every dollar invested on the screen in best case scenario the final result of all this enormous effort is a shiny round laser disk in the thin cover placed on the shelf in video store,0
about twenty minutes into this movie i was already bored quite simply these characters were fairly dull occasionally something enjoyable would happen but then things would slow down again fortunately my patience was eventually rewarded and the ending to this movie was not bad at all however it was by no means good enough to justify sitting through the first ninety minutes so i would say that the movie was mediocre overall and considering all of the talent in the cast i would call this a disappointment,0
panic in the streets opens in high noir style a view along a dark street followed by a camera tilt upwards to a window behind which is playing out a sleazy card game  an opening flourish which along with some of the location shooting anticipates some of the atmosphere welles brought a decade later in touch of evil one of the players throws open the window it is an appropriate action serving as an introduction to the events within as well as literally opening up our first view of the underworldshot in high contrast black and white panic in the streets benefits immensely from a strong cast as well as some fine location shooting in new orleans scenes set in such places as the mortuary the crowded shipping office or amidst the peeling paint of franks place offer a unique and sometimes claustrophobic atmosphere impossible to recreate in the studio with these elements kazans film shows the influence of dassins groundbreaking naked city of two years earlier which established the gritty almost documentary style within the noir cycle in fact widmarks previous role had been in dassins even finer night and the city a film in which a sense of rising panic was even more prevalent joe macdonald a favourite with the director photographed panic in the streets detailed environment macdonald also worked on kazans pinky and viva zapata and went on to shoot widmark again three years later in fullers masterpiece pick up on south streetas others have noticed in a manner typical of some noir films kazans work offers a contrast between the confusion sickness and immorality of the streets with the modest calm home life of the reeds but whereas for instance in langs the big heat one thousand nine hundred and fiftythree the home life of the hero is destroyed by elements of vice surrounding the embattled central character  ultimately sending him back to work with an increased vigilance and sense of vengeance  panic in the streets places reeds rising anxiousness within the confines of what amounts to just another working day despite all the danger ultimately he returns back to the bosom of his family justified and satisfied the implication being that social balance has been restored at least for the moment by his professionalism and curative skillsthat imbalance of course has been created by crime and disease the two are closely associated in this film it reminds one of the tagline from the much cruder cobra one thousand nine hundred and eightysix  where crime is the disease meet the cure a neat analogy in context if one which rings too uncomfortably of social reductionism at its climax as blackie attempts to flee aboard ship the visuals specifically allude to rats as being similar to criminals both posing a menace to societys health as the presumably infected blackie prowls round the cheap rooms and the docks with his cronies in search of something he suspects everyone is after if without knowing exactly what it is plague and blackie resonate together in the audiences mind adding further to connected associations ironically blackies hunch about poldis unfortunate cousin that he brought something in of note is correct  even if finally its nothing he can sell or steal blackies logical assumption that the police would not normally bother with the murder of some anonymous illegal immigrant has a ring of truth about it and his so confusion is understandabledr reed although homeloving and on the side of society is a true noir hero familiar to the genre is the chief protagonist as a man who walks alone forced to travel beyond the limits of the law in his way reed is forced to take morality into his own hands for the sake of society at large  a dimension of the film that is particularly apposite given director kazans controversial personal history the director testified before the infamous huac naming suspected communists and fellow travellers his film depicts suspects being hauled in for questioning and the manhandling of the press on the grounds that the overriding public good justified the means these actions perhaps echo the directors sentiments at the time presumably accepting the mccarthyite witch hunt and the suppression of civil rights it entailed in the light of presumed communist infiltration of the entertainment industry in these times of terrorist threats and state response such issues as they appear in the film are strikingly modernstandout scenes in the film include a notable scene where blackie interrogates the dying poldi as to the precise nature of his cousins presumed contraband cat like blackie stalks his victim across the room eventually preying over the doomed mans sick bed holding poldis feverish head in his hands  a striking evil cradling it is a gesture emphasising the intimate nature of corruption whether moral or physical apparently the actors did many or all of their own stunts which leads to some other very dramatic scenes at the end as the police and health authorities close in on the villains under the wharfs half crawling half scrambling over the slippery timbers at the edge of the dock pool must have been an experience very uncomfortable for palance but it is sequence that adds immensely to the immediacy of it alloccasionally less convincing elements distract the viewer apparently dr reed is left to fight a potential national emergency little government backup perhaps just as astonishingly he never inoculates himself  inviting a dramatic turn which never materialises at the end of the film too the potential epidemic has been halted all contactees located a little too neatly but these weaknesses are more than outweighed by the other satisfactions of a film that still makes for compulsive and relevant viewing today,1
we brought this film as a joke for a friend and could of been our worst joke to play the film is barely watchable and the acting is dire the worst child actor ever used and hasslehoff giving a substandard performance the plot is disgraceful and at points we was so bored we was wondering what the hell was going on it tries to be gruesome in places but is just laughablejust terrible,0
who knew they could be so funny christopher meloni and janel moloney are known more for their outstanding work in some of televisions hottest dramas law  order svu and the west wing put them together on the big screen and what you get is an engaging romantic comedy with plenty of laughsthe actors develop the storys ongoing relationship with impressive skill leaving the audience bound to fall in love with barry singer meloni despite the fact he is a standup comic who also happens to be a meanspirited sexist jerkyou will be rooting for him even as he takes all his insecurities with the opposite sex and chases thea moloney halfway around the country in hopes of winning her heart they have so little in commonbut when barry finally opens his heart you will wonder why thea keeps running awaythe souler opposite is a wonderful movie with an incredible cast and a gifted writer well worth your time,1
no i have never seen any of the santa slasher series ie silent night deadly night the original black christmas or this one christmas evil i have heard all about their reputation or mads mothers against deranged santas i thought i would rent this one as i have heard it pop up as a reference on a fat guys at the movies segmentmothers should be against this but not for the ooooohhhh killer santa but for the fact this movie was just plain crap boring long  even at only ninetytwo minutes craplittle boy sees santa arrive down a chimney in one thousand nine hundred and fortyseven deliver presents eat some goodies and miraculously float up the chimney boy goes to bed but returns to living room to witness mommy and santa sort of getting it on apparently this messed up that kid for the rest of his life though the scene was about as steamy as when ralphies dad got the leg lamp in a christmas story he was sooo disturbed he went to the attic and well cut his own handfast forward to the future now it is one thousand nine hundred and eighty and messed up boy works in a toy factory we get a whiff of him being a little offkilter and he stalks both kids and parents alike who is naughty who is nice blah blah it takes a good twothirds of the film to get him to finally snap  as if that is not foreshadowed from frame one no movie should take that longi will admit this movie had its tension building but only because i kept expecting him to do something anything to anyone when he finally does well punish who is naughty it is as graphic as a garbage pail kid card and i have not mentioned the wtf ending i am thinking it was a metaphor but in reality it is just as weird as the rest of the movie take the brother who is upset his sibling is killing and his solution isuh killing do not open this mess even on christmas eve or evil again i did not watch the other santaslashers but this one sucked bad it built up suspense due to the nature of the movie and never once delivered a decent present,0
if derivative and predictable raperevenge thrillers are your thing then you are in for a rare treat they do not really appeal to me so i could not find any single thing to redeem this peculiar tale it seems like something straight out of the one thousand nine hundred and eightys a different age when this would have gone straight to video gillian anderson and danny dyer do ok work with a weak script and a tedious scenario but what is gillian anderson doing getting involved with a film like this after the brilliance of her performance as lady deadlock in the bbc tv adaptation of bleak house last year the director is said to have been influenced by witnessing a nearrape and by his work on documentaries but even that is not an excuse for the bizarre scene where a pack of rural hounds beat up dyer i do not think i was the only person in the cinema laughing what i cannot understand is the involvement of the companies behind this film  filmfour and verve pictures both have been involved in some great independent british films in recent years verve distributed bullet boy code fortysix and red road  straightheads does not deserve to be mentioned in the same breath filmfour and verve take note is this really the best you can do what are independent british filmmakers going to make of your artistic judgement it is a big blot on both of your reputations listen carefully can you hear the thousands of fans of independent british films crying in despair,0
i had watched several days film shooting of this movie that summerthe end result was just two scenes in the movie the location was sylvan lake in the black hills bring the wagonstop the wagon etc  so this dakota youth looked forward to seeing the movie and was not disappointed the local buffalo herd was being culled so the shooting scenes were for real yes doris animals were hurt during filming i think the ending was copied by jack nicholson in the shining a great westernsocial comment from the fiftys this should be in the same class as high noon for real western drama or used as a social statement like blackboard jungle or rebel without a because was for fiftys youth,1
a reasonable effort is summary for this film a good sixties film but lacking any sense of achievement maggie smith gave a decent performance which was believable enough but not as good as she could have given other actors were just dreadful a terrible portrayal it was not very funny and so it did not really achieve its genres as it was not particularly funny and it was not dramatic the only genre achieved to a satisfactory level was romance target audiences were not hit and the movie sent out confusing messages a very basic plot and a very basic storyline were not pulled off or performed at all well and people were left confused as to why the film was not as good and who the target audiences were etc however maggie was quite good and the storyline was alright with moments of capabilityfour,0
first of all yes i am white so i try to tread lightly in the ever delicate subject of race anyway white people hating black people  bad but black people hating white people  ok because apparently we deserved it where do i start i wish i had something good to say about this movie aside unintended comedy scenes the infamous scene were ice cube and co get in a fight with some really big really strong really really angry and scary looking neonazis and win the neonazi where twice the size  and the chase the chase is priceless this is not a movie about race tolerance and understanding it does not deliver this is a racist movie that reaffirm all the cliché stereotypes the white wimpy guy who gets manhandled by his black roommate automatically transform in a skinheadcmon simply awful i do regret ever seeing itsave your time and the dreadful experience of a poorly written poorly acted dull and clearly biased picture if you are into the subject go and rent american history x now that is a movie,0
allen goes to the country somewhere he hates going in real life and has a weekend with his friends  which are the usual successful white middleclass bellyaching types that feature in many of his filmsi usually find something to amuse in woody allen comedies but here he really falls totally flat on his face even the oneliners seem to have deserted him the really is no plot bar bits and pieces of cod shakespeare  but allen seems to use the location to allow a semimystical air which just makes the thing even more witless and halfbakedit just does not work at any level and is just a giant bore the best thing about this film apart from the end credits coming up is that the bad reviews seem to get him to wake up and realise that simply throwing together a slapdash script and casting your mates in it does not make for entertainment,0
knowing how old a film is ought to prepare the viewer for a few things and with those things in mind perhaps the moviell be more tolerable so it was when i watched revolt of the zombies the heavy reliance on tedious dialogue and corny movements should be expected as should the primitiveness or absence of special effects in those days a great deal is asked from the imagination of the onlooker  maybe too much in this case and the plot is not easy to follow some zombiefied southeast asian soldiers in wwi performed very admirably although skeptical as to why if true the explanation should stay out of the wrong hands so off goes a group to archaeologically investigate the key to longdistance hypnosis is learned by a member of the expedition who uses it to among other purposes temporarily dispense with the beau of the gal for whom he has the hots to prove his love for her he gives up his hold on everybody which he should not have done because once they are all unzombiefied many want to kill him so that he will never control them again below average even with precautionary forethought recommended for only the extremely patient,0
this movie is suppose to be a mysterious serious thriller about a man looking for a missing girl however thirty minutes into the movie it turns into a funny unrealistic story with annoying characters and random scenes i cannot imagine anyone not laughing when cage randomly karate kicks that blonde girl or when he bear punches that old lady the lines characters and acting are all poorly done from the getgo i have always liked nicolas cage as an actor but he has made some terrible movies this year this being by far the worst one yeti would not recommend this movie to anyone who wants to watch an intense storygripping thriller if you really want to enjoy this story go rent the original however if you intend on watching it get ready to laugh at some of the lines and end scenes rather than taking them seriously that is the only way you enjoy this film,0
seriously what were they thinking over the course of years the columbo series has tried out some new things and diverted away from the usual successful formula but this movie really overdoes it this movie is basically very different from any other columbo movie but the differences are not for the good of the moviemain thing that of course makes this movie different from any other columbo movie is the fact that there is no murder being committed the entire premise of this movie is totally different and it places the columbo character in a totally different environment and situation also the overall is just totally different and more modernizeddirector alan j levi did some other columbo movies in the past which all very much sticked to the usual formula it also makes it an odd choice that he got picked to direct this moviethe columbo character himself also feels quite different perhaps because of the reason that he gets placed in a totally different environment and situation when he helps out his nephew after his bride disappeared right after the wedding the absence of some good relieving and trademark columbo humor also does not exactly make this a good or enjoyable watchin all honesty the movie does not begin too bad but the movie starts to become more and more ridicules with its story as it progresses it is such a stupid written kidnapthriller with a story that starts to become more and more unlikely it also makes the movie more and more unwatchable this is a very little interesting columbo entry that also really does not know to entertain its viewers in any wayit also does not help much that the supporting actors are not the most talented ones around despite the fact that his character is put in such a totally different situation and the movie is shot in such a completely different style peter falk still holds up well and his presence still somewhat saves this movie can you just imaging how this movie would had been without him it would had been an extremely bad and ridicules cheap movie i can tell youan odd columbo entry which could be described as a failed experiment to divert from the usual formulafourten,0

when this movie first came out back in one thousand nine hundred and eightyfour prince was one of the hottest acts around everyone wanted to see this movie which was not much more than a extended music video the acting was pretty bad but what can you expect from musicians acting on the big screen for the first time despite that it was still a very entertaining film morris day and jerome benton provide some all time classic comedy especially their rendition of the password which will make you think of abbott  costello doing their who is on first baseball routineappolina who went by a single name then provided some beautiful breasts so you had the brief nudity covered plus she is very attractive and of course the soundtrack of the album is one of the best prince ever recorded prince later on had a fallout with warner bros and changed his name but at this particular time in his career he was at the top of his gamethis movie does not rank in the all time great category but it is pretty entertaining,1
my parents took me to this movie when i was nine years old i have never forgotten it i had never before seen anything as beautiful as elizabeth taylor she was twentytwo when she made elephant walk remember i am nine so the feelings are not sexual i just could not see anything else on the screen i just wanted to sit at her feet like a puppy and stare up at her she has begun to show her age she is almost seventyfour but i still believe her to be one of the most beautiful and breathtaking women to ever have livedi have seen the movie several times since and it is a sappy melodrama what saves it is of course miss taylors beauty magnificent scenery the very impressive elephant stampede and a wellmade point on human arrogance in the face of natureall in all a wellspent couple of hours watching the movie channel or a rented video,1

spoilers in thisrosenstraße is a movie about heroic women in german nazi time but it is way too long it is not touching and sometimes even boring there are too many clichés and not enough good actingthe storytelling storyline is bad like in james cameron´s titanic an old woman remembers events of her live good now we´ve got a point of view than there is another woman introduced who does the same confusing is that they both are recalling events of lifes of other people come on this is a lack of knowledge of basic story tellinghow can riemann know about the fate of the little girl´s mother and her interrogation for examplethe scenes are shown in the wrong order and you rarely know when it took place for example the scene when riemann is proposing to fabian when did that happen the scene looks like it is set in the twentiesriemann´s character is of course a talented pianist well she is even a baroness wow her brother comes back from the eastern front he has received a ritterkreuz which he is showing in some scenes so he is a war hero and still a fine man who preserved his conscience and he gained knowledge of massacres committed by germans he even made some photographs and so it goes cliché after cliché is piling up and this is why the movie does not workbasically von trotta made a chick flick out of something what could have been a decent movie and in the end it´s all very simple riemann finds a way to get goebbels into bed and  ta da  everyone is free which is not a historical fact but pure imagination despite the true story claim at the beginning like sass it is vaguely based on a true eventit is sad but true this is the typical german movie these days it is bad macaulay j connor,0

this is to the zatoichi movies as the star trek movies were to star trekexcept that in this case every one of the originals was more entertaining and interesting than this big shiny redo and also better made if substance is more important than surface had i never seen them i would have thought this goodlooking but empty since i had i thought its style inappropriate and its content insufficient the idea of reviving the character in a bigger slicker production must have sounded good but there was no point in it other than the hope of making money it is just a show which mostly fails to capture the atmosphere of the characters world and wholly fails to take the character anywhere he has not been already also the actor was not at his best i would been hoping to see ichi at a late stage of life in a story that would see him out gracefully and draw some conclusion from his experience overall this just rehashes bits and pieces from the other movies seasoned with more sex and sfx violence not the same experience at all,0
what an overlooked eightys soundtrack i imagine john travolta sang some of the songs but in watching the movie it did seem to personify everything that was eightys cheese clearly movies that rely on mechanical bulls bartenders and immature relationships were in style the best was his lousy texas accent compare that to friday night lightsi suggest watching cocktail and stir crazy to start really getting into the dumbing down of film also as a side note made in america with ted danson and whoopie goldberg is an awesomely bad movie i was so shocked to realize i had never watched it one more weird movie of this genre would have to include cadilac man with robin williams just remember all of these big stars played big roles in these cheesy movies tom cruise richard pryor robin williams and john travolta,1
this chinese movie made me feel so many similarities with members of a culture i do not belong and are far from in an almost buddhist approach the film helps one to relate to each character and to the happiness of doing the simple routine things all actors are brilliant and xu hzu exudes kindness and wisdom yet also vulnerable and mean er min the retarded brother shows us that intelligence and wisdom are not equal and that wisdom comes to and from the most disparate persons in this universe a different china this is far from the chinese realism yet it has lots of humanity and realism of a different kindget it you will not be disappointed,1
this movie is pretty awful but i have some interesting information about itit was filmed in one thousand nine hundred and seventysix at northern arizona university in flagstaff az as well as at oak creek canyon near sedona az a good bulk of the extras in the film are thendrama students from nau i was a freshman there that year minoring in theatre but for some reason i did not get involved with the production i did however know several people who did and can supply this rather odd factthere is a scene in this movie where two of the principals as part of their hazing ritual have to run naked into the woods they are seen from behind in the movie doing just that the thing is those are not the actors at all but two guys i knew from the theatre department the identity of these stunt posteriors will remain anonymous at least to this website unless they decide to um reveal themselves,0
i love anthony hopkins as an actor so i was very interested to see how he would do as a writerdirector i could not have been more disappointed by this move the movie was so disjointed and the cinematography was so over done to the point i wanted to pull the plug out of the wall the actors were very good but it was such a waste of talent not all actors are cut out to be writers or directors and clearly mr hopkins falls into this category of all the movies i have ever seen in my fifty years this is absolutely the worst movie ever please do us all a favor mr hopkins and stick to acting which you are excellent at and leave the writing and directing to those who are talented in those areas if i could give this movie a rating less than one i certainly would,0
i think micheal ironsides acting career must be over if he has to star in this sort of low budge crap surely he could do better than waste his time in this rubbishthis movie could be far better if it had a good budget but it shows repeatedly throughout the movie there is one scene at a outpost which looks like its outside the front of a railway station and i bet it wasthere is one scene which made give this movie a three and it shows the space craft landing and taking off over a lake surrounded by forests this was well done but the rest of the movie forget itthere is another scene which looks like a engineering plant which i bet it and does not look like a space outpost as the character say it isthis movie is stupid has a serious low budget makes no sense and god help micheal ironsides,0
i saw this film last night on cable and it is extraordinary what i love most about it is that it is understated and lowkey but deeply heartfelt henry thomas he played the child in et performance is masterfully inarticulate he is supposed to be a man of few words david straithern is a wonderful crazy villain and miraculously given that we are talking about a hollywood product here a baby serves as a main character but one who does not act or have lines but rather just is  is luminous at that interesting to note that thomas mysterious relationship w et was the core of that film while his bond w the baby serves as the core of a good babythen there is the musicah what music gillian welchs tunes are wonderful  the entire score is gorgeous hill country musicthis film is wonderfully atmospheric i recommend it highly,1
this film is probably promuslimization why do i write that the main character has a muslim father and a christian mother he lives his first twenty years in a christian village in the end of the film he seemingly is a muslim because of his headwear that he has kept his amulet and his general clothing he has a six year old child who wears the same headwear and therefore is probably a muslim although the mother is a christian the main character thus chooses to it seems to be a muslim and his child becomes a muslim no one of the other male main characters which are christians seems to breed a child there are more muslims in the world of this movie at the end of it it therefore seems,0
legendary movie producer walt disney brought three of the worlds greatest fairy tales to the screen they remain among the most popular animated films of all time the first was his groundbreaking classic snow white and the seven dwarfs released in one thousand nine hundred and thirtyseven the last was the thenunder appreciated sleeping beauty which made it is debut in one thousand nine hundred and fiftynine in between these two was perhaps his most satisfying adaptation of a classic fairy tale cinderella one thousand nine hundred and fifty of the three films cinderella is the one most faithful to its origins ironically unlike snow white which for better or worse became for many the definitive version of the story cinderella did not follow the same path although it was a hit and like snow white was responsible for restoring the dwindling disney fortunes it never achieved the same audience recognition which it certainly deserved disney for once did himself proud electing not to tamper with a classic instead elaborating and adding substance to the tale rather than rewriting it for the screen the result was enchanting a combination of superb animation in beautifully soft technicolor and the perfect voice talents brought the story to life with a radiance that endures to this day ilene woods who was a radio performer recorded demonstration discs of the songs as a favor to the authors of the material al hoffman mack david and jerry livingston when disney heard them he knew he had found his cinderella and indeed he had woods heartfelt renditions of a dream is a wish your heart makes so this is love and oh sing sweet nightingale are perfect eleanor audley who would go on to voice maleficent in sleeping beauty masterfully captured the icy cruelty of the stepmother while rhoda williams and lucille bliss were convincingly nasty stepsisters luis van rooten admirably performed as both the king and the grand duke and james macdonald was endearing as both jaq and gus cinderellas devoted mice william phipps has little dialog as the prince future talk show host mike douglas provided his singing voice but film and disney veteran verna felton was born to play the fairy godmother and she made the best number the oscarnominated bibbidibobbidiboo her own showstopper among the artists responsible for the look of the film was mary blair whose inspired use of color was greatly admired by disney her elegant frenchperiod backgrounds add tremendously to the quality of the movie but most important of all are the believable charactersfrom cinderella right down to lucifer the stepmothers deliciously evil cat they bring both life and vibrancy to the often told story something very difficult to create in an animated filmin conjunction with the films fiftyfiveyear anniversary and not so coincidentally the coming holiday season cinderella has just been released on a special edition dvd it simply has never looked better the fully restored film must be seen to be appreciatedsuffice it to say it looks wonderful an enhanced stereo soundtrack has been added and serves the music well the dvd extras now a standard part of disney platinum editions are too numerous to list here but as usual some are directed towards children some are slanted to adults and the rest fall somewhere in between but real fans will want to get the deluxe gift set because along with an actual cell from the film and eight character sketches it includes a one hundred and sixtypage hardback book which not only incorporates most of the material found in the book with the one thousand nine hundred and ninetyfive special edition home video release but much more as well as usual for disney cinderella will only be available for a limited time so if like me you are a cinderella lover get it now this edition is truly a dream come true,1
tv does influence societyjust look at the surge in popularity of cappucino shops after this shallow little piece of work debuted besides real people who look as good as these people do do not have any problemsbesides does anyone really believe that these people can afford to live in a nice manhattan loft considering what they do for a living nbc just loves to insult the viewers intelligence even if they are just around gumps level i know a person who makes one hundredzero a year as a web designer and lives in a tiny onebedroom apartment in manhattan that costs two thousand two hundred a month in rent i would like to see a show called phriends where it is six ugly nobodies in deadend jobs living in a crummy neighborhood where sirens constantly wail and someone gets mugged every weekand then the landlord jacks up the rent now that i would watch,0
for the initial twenty minutes or so i was watching it on a pstwo so i have really no idea how long it took alienator sets up an interesting premise i do not think i have seen a slasher movie with an alien from another planet as the baddie before however interest soon turns into stunned disbelief as you realise the alien is a huge bodybuilder woman in a steel bikini yes alienator is patently ridiculousdo not think i hold that against it in the world of shlockhorror patently ridiculous can often be a good sign however the blatant stupidity of its premise is all the movie really has going for it alienator is funny as hell but it is also a shambolic suckfest of the highest order actors heap on failed attempts at seriousness potentially genius lines of pure cheese dialogue are stumbled over with unnerving incompetence and the direction fails to sum up even one or two decent setpieces by the time the movies finished you can barely see the original concept through the haystack of total tripe the team piled on itadd to this the fact that the alien just kills people by vaporising them as opposed to doing any slashing as such and you have a giant throbbing heap of good ideas being left to rot you will laugh at alienator but at it not with it if that is your thing then go ahead and check it out,0
i was hoping for some sort of indepth background information on the apollo eleven mission and what i got was some decent interview material with buzz aldrin gene krantz and other people involved in the mission linked by overhyped disasterpredicting sensationalising voiceover in the worst tradition of tv productionif you could cut out the voiceover and change the spin of the program to a positive testament of how people can overcome setbacks to achieve a goal out of the ordinary then this could have been great  but i feel i have wasted about fortyfive minutes of my life whilst watching a sixty minute programme i want those minutes back,0
i must be that one guy in america that did not like this movie i guess this just was not my style or something i just do not see what is so fascinating about it this was barely entertaining let alone one of the greatest achievements in cinema history it is about a guy that came from nothing and goes on to become a drug lord pretty simple way to describe an entire movie and that is exactly my feeling about the entire movie contrary to what a lot of people think just because a movie is about mafiasdrug tradecriminal groups does not automatically make it a great movie do not forget good storytelling,0
i have seen many good korean movies including thrillers and movies with darker overtone but this one sucks the director seems to be a sadist who happened to get someone to produce some junk the movie lacks any sort of entertainment value and is not even a thriller i cannot believe someone really made such a movie even though acting is ok the story line and the feeling it leaves is awfuli am sure i am not going to see any movies of this director no sense of movie making and utter disappointment in having thriller moments all this has is showing scenes with psychopath wasting the reels with badly shot scenes and showing more blood and violence thinking that makes it thrilling very disappointing movie and i strongly recommend skipping all the movies of this sort,0
one of the best amitabh comeback movies i liked this was the phase when govinda was going strong with dhawan the songs were awesome and totally as we call it masti type an evergreen entertainer with the likes of the multifaceted anupam kher chipping in the story line has a lot of hilarious twists and turns as is known for david dhawans potboilers with a timely appearance by mrsmadhuri nene dixit it was a total riot towards the end it was great to see amit perform with such force and humor after a long exile although some may consider it a typical bollywood masala movie i would watch it any day i am giving it an easy eight out of ten just for being pure bollywood,1
good lord and that coming from an atheist this movie is bad much has already been said by the reviewers before the ones who rated this piece three and below to which i fully agree i just like to add a few things among the three guys who had to eat their own digestive end products got chopped up by an axe raped by a broomstick had their balls blown away  the exboyfriend suffers the worst torture while having to listen to the girls endless and pointless babble at the kitchen table as do we but at least we have the mercy of the mute buttonhad the director cut out the point and endless graveyard and inverted scenes our suffering would have been over after thirty minutesthe only things that made this flick at least somewhat bearable are emily haacks tits one pointforget it do not buy it do not waste your time and your sanity my brain is so fried after watching this i feel the urgent need to watch and suffer scrapbook right now,0

from the excellent acting of an extremely impressive cast to the intelligently written and very quotable script from the lavish cinematography to the beautiful music score by carter burwell rob roy offers a rarity in movie going experiences one that is nigh impossible to find fault with in any areathere have been several comparisons made with braveheart which came out the same year with all due credit to mel gibson braveheart struck me as too much of a selfconscious and preachy epic to rival rob roy as the kind of movie i would care to see more than once while braveheart works hard to be a serious epic rob roy just grabs you and absorbs you into its tightly edited storytelling not a single scene is wastedrob roy contains the perfect balance of dramatic tension action and even occasional humor the characters are well fleshedout perfectly conveying vernacular and mannerisms that anchor them in their authentic period settingfurther they are not caricatures of good and evil as we all too often observe in even modern filmfor example while we hope the heroic rob roy prevails we realize his predicaments are products of his own pride and sense of honor tim roth plays one of the most hateful bad guys in the history of cinema yet there are moments when we can understand how the events of his life have shaped him into becoming what he is rob roy employs a level of character development that makes its story even more believable and grippingrob roy is a delightful treasure featuring one of the greatest sword fights ever choreographed and a climatic ending worthy of all the tense anticipation,1
many of the criticisms on this thread seem to pick a comparison of this film with the mortal storm or casablanca everyone is entitled to compare films they choose but the similarities of the mortal storm and watch on the rhine are clearly the problems of refugees threatened by the nazi juggernaut while the main comparative point brought out with casablanca is the seeming unjust treatment of humphrey bogart in one thousand nine hundred and fortythree by the academy of motion picture arts and science because they chose paul lukas instead for the best actor oscar it does not strike me as totally wrong lukas had a good career in film both here and in england  he is the villain in the lady vanishes and this performance was his best one bogart had more great performances in him than rick blaine for instance he was ignored for sam spade in the maltese falcon and roy earle in high sierra two years earlier both of which were first rate performances and he would not get an oscar for his greatest performances as fred c dobbs in the treasure of sierra madres the writermurder suspect in in a lonely place and captain philip francis queeg in the caine mutiny afterward  he got it for charley in the african queen i think that bogie should have got it for the role of dobbs but it did not happen but lukas was lucky  he got it on the defining performance of his lesser career few can claim thatto me the film to look at with watch on the rhine is based on another playscript by hellman the searching wind they both look at americas spirit of isolationism in the one thousand nine hundred and twentys and one thousand nine hundred and thirtys the searching wind is really looking at the whole interwar period while watch on the rhine set in the years just proceeding our entry into world war ii deals with a few weeks of time therefore it is better constructed as a play and more meaningful for it is impact the film has many good performances led by lukas as the exhausted but determined antinazi fightercourier davis as his loyal wife wisely keeping her character as low keyed as possible due to lukas being the center of the plays activities coulouris as the selfish conniving but ultimately foolish and ineffective teck lucille watson as the mother of davis and geraldine fitzgerald as coulouris wiser and sadder and fed up wife and kurt katch who delivers a devastating critique as the local embassys gestapo chief about coulouris and others who would deal with the nazis it has dialog with bite in it and what it says is quite true it also has moments of near poetry witness the scene towards the end when coulouris is left alone with lukas and davis and says the new world has left the scene to the old world hellman could write very well at timesgiven the strength of the film script and performances i would rate this film highly among world war ii films,1
certain elements of this film are dated of course an all white male crew for instance and like most prestar wars science fiction it tends to take too long admiring itselfbut still no movie has ever capture the flavor of golden age science fiction as this one did even down to the use of the electronic tonalities to provide the musical score robbie the robot epitomized the asimov robots and was the inspiration for all that followed from cthreepo to datathe plot line of course is shakespeares the tempest morbius is prospero and exiled wizard who finds his kingdom invaded by interlopers it was a movie that treated science fiction as an adult genre perhaps the first,1
aldolpho steve buscemi an aspiring film maker lives in a battered nyc apartment and relies on his mother to help make the rent he has a beautiful neighbor named angelica jennifer bealswho may or may not be married but who aldolpho would love to star in his movie when al unexpectedly gets a financial promise of funding for his film from a strange man named joe he thinks he is got it made that is until joe takes al along on an adventure to steal a porsche for part of the financial backing will the film be made before aldolpho is completely without a moral backbone and will angelica star in the film this is in this viewers opinion an awful movie the script is abysmal with a plot that wanders willy nilly beals practically snarls all of her lines and buscemi though likable is nondescript there is a good deal of distasteful material and unsavory characters to boot finally the production values are very poor too making the film look second rate at all times if you have time on your hands it is still a good idea not to take a chance with this movie but if you are the proverbial glutton for punishment go ahead and watch the darn thing beals does look beautiful after all,0
i love movies and i will watch any movie all the way through just to give it a chance i can finally say that i found a movie i cannot watch all the way through the acting is terribly stale and monotone the cgi looks like a computer geek did it in his mothers basement with minimal software andthe long scenes of justwalking and this movie is three hours long i did not even make it fifteen minutes until i fast forwarded the dvd the scenes with the aliens are very short ummm instead of naming this war of the worlds let us name this war of the walking long distances this cost five million dollars to make what they spend the money on the dramatic opening songoh but on a positive note one scene you need to watch is when the aliens first begin killing people that is hilarious not because people are dying but because when they turn to skeletons they still squirm for twenty seconds afterwardsolike i said if you are a fan of boring stale actionless movies here is one for you dvd collection but i did not write this for you i wrote this for the billions upon billions of other people who will hate this movie it is not worth your time or moneyi know this is by the book but the book is not that long and i am a complete book wormnerdgeekwhatever but why just get the steven spielberg version it is not all that good but it is ten times better than this i give this a big fat zero out of ten,0
good story and excellent animation the influence of frazetta and bakshi are obvious and that is a good thing anyone that enjoys conan the barbarian or the game dungeons and dragons should enjoy it the battle between good and evil is clear cut even though it may appear that at times our hero is neutral most often in fantasy movies elves are usually portrayed as having white skin and blond hair and goblins and orcs have dark skin and hair anyone familiar with frazettas bakshis or even tolkiens work know they are not racist anyone that enjoys fantasy movies should like this movie it is not for young children due to violence and sexual innuendo the casting was well done and the scenes and music are first rate i hope someone puts this gem on dvd soon i consider myself lucky to have a vhs copy in good condition,1
almost golden the jessica savitch storyaspect ratio onethirtythreeonesound format stereobland soapopera dramatisation of the rise and fall of americas first female tv news anchor with a tighter script and direction  and a better cast  this might have passed muster but the flimsy story really was not worth the effort a good documentary on the subject might have been the best way to go typically strong production values in the tv movie conveyorbelt manner but it is all as superficial as old fluff and just as engaging,0
the actual crime story at the core of in cold blood might seem a little tame for those who are weened on the classic serial killer stories gein bundy dahmer or just the more notorious cases out in hollywood oj manson the essential facts in the case do not amount to anything terribly convoluted perry smith and dick hickock here played by robert blake and scott wilson respectively met by some luck conspired to rob a mans farmhouse safe out in kansas and after killing a family of four with a shotgun and dagger came away with fortythree dollars aside from their returning to the us after fleeing briefly to mexico there is not a whole lot of mystery to the resolution either they were caught by some stroke of ironic chance a cop followed them and stopped them for having a stolen car after smith and hickcock helped out a boy and his old man collecting bottles for change and sentenced to hang by the neck until dead the story ended in one thousand nine hundred and sixtyfivebut it is the handling of the story moments of moot the performances a pure cinematic touch that brooks and his absolutely marvelous the lategreat dp conrad hall provides in crisp widescreen black and white and a storytelling style that feels realistic without going into too much naturalism or too much melodrama save perhaps for near the end which is pitch perfect the air of tragedy hangs over the story and not so much because of the killings themselves no matter how brutal they are as the third man that is conjured up as the narrator observes by smith and hickcock teaming up but because of the inevitability of the story you feel somehow for these criminals who in any other hands would be just be conventional figures or something out of a bmovie these are not good people but they are not necessarily monsters either at least all the way throughit is also an excellent roadmovie as we see smith and hickcock on the road down to the clutter residence the actual nighttime scene of the crime taking place late in the film then on to mexico then back to america towards las vegas we get to soak in the personalities of these two probably even more than that of the police detectives who at first have no leads and then finally get a break with an inmate it is actually kind of disturbing to get this close to these two sort of akin to the aimless quality of malicks badlands characters and it is also a sign of daring for the period there is no sermonizing like he did this because of that and this or the other we see how smith had an abusive psychotic father but that smith loved and hated him the complexity there is too much for the movie maybe even too much for capotes book which i should confess i have still yet to read though i plan to and we see hickcock is this creature of slick confidence ie getting the suit and other things with bad checks but without any deeprooted explanation to it allthe streak of fatalism in in cold blood is some of the starkest of the sixtys and it is the luck of brooks to have its stars as blake in his topofthepops performance this and lost highway oddly enough considering his real life saga in recent years his quintessential pieces of work and wilsons breakthrough before becoming a character actor while they are surrounded by fine supporting work they themselves are eerily absorbing driven more or less by greed and fantasies of escapism with treasure and staying pretty much grounded in their situation through the death row and on through their ends is this a morale of the story if there could be one that it is more horrifying to confront the possibility that those who kill cannot be classified of good vs evil getting smudged smith apologized for his crime before being hung and he points out but to who this is a story bound to give the most hardened fans of truecrime the bonafide chills and it is quite possibly the best american film of one thousand nine hundred and sixtyseven,1
this movie tells the tender tale of a demented scientist who after his fiance is decapitated goes around ogling strippers so that he can find a suitable body to attach her noggin to everyone in this movie exudes more slime than a snail particularly our protagonist,0
this is a great movie for the true romantics and sports lovers alikedrew barrymore is at her best in this movie as a drew fan it was quite nice to see her shine after having several flops i had my doubts about jimmy fallon but he totally delivered as ben the comical sports crazed sweetheart the comedy in this movie is great there were several laugh out loud momentstheir first date started rocky when he showed up at her apartment with flowers and she was sick to her stomach from eating a new place earlier in the day instead of leaving he helps take care of her helping her change into pajamas then cleaning up the puke on her toilet and bathroom later telling her that she was very ladylikeno chunks everything goes great between ben and lindsay the whole winter but then baseball season starts lindsay starts to realize just how obsessed ben is with the red sox and why this seemingly great guy is still single she tries to shrug it off and think of it as a good thing as she has a busy work schedule and she will not feel guilty for working extra hours while he is at games she even buys all the books on the red sox she can find including one on the curse of bambinoeverything is going pretty well until lindsay has a false alarm having missed her period it both makes them both realize how serious they are getting and she begins to question if this is the person she wants to be with a very touching part in the movie is after she tells him she got her period it shows him sadly putting away a baby sized red sox jersey he had bought just in case she was pregnanteventually ben tries to show her how important she is and decides to go to her friends birthday party after she said i had to check my calender and when i saw the there was a red soxyankee game i knew i would be going stag after the party ben tells her it was the best night of his life shortly after he gets a call from his pal who went to the game he gave up for the party and told him it was the best game ever ben freaks out about missing it and ends up really hurting lindsay when she says a few minutes ago you were saying this was the best night of your life he says well that was a few minutes agoso they separate for a while he realizes how immature his obsession is and decides to sell his season tickets which he inherited from his uncle because if he did not it would remind him too much of what he gave up for them lindsay finds out through a friend and decides to stop him realizing he is doing it for her it ends very sweetly showing how his childhood love for baseball has been over shadowed for a whole new deeper love lindsay they still go to the games and even attend the final world series game and st louis and it is a happy ending all around two thumbs up,1
robot jox does not suffer from story or bad effects i mean this was one thousand nine hundred and ninety if you know what i am talking about robocop two still used the stop animation as most of the movies did throughout the eightys if you look at your biggest blockbusters during this period most of them did what they could with the special effects shots that was available to them at the time it was not until terminator two judgment day was released the following year that a breakthrough in technology was realized and story boarders began to use that motive but you will have fond memories of transformers gundam wing even power rangers if you watch this film the enemy robot is very menacing it makes you not want to face the man without a really good backup plan and there are some great moments within this film a traitorspy is working within their midsts who you think is on your side backing you up all the way could be the person you did not expect himher to be and that is very troublesome to think so do not you agree,1
spoilerswhile the historical accuracy might be questionable and with the mass appeal of the inaccurate lotr such things are more easily excused now i liked the art ness of it though not really an art house film it does provide a little emotionally charged scenes from time to time i have two complaints one it is too short and two the voice you hear whispering from time to time is not explainedeighttenquality tenten entertainment seventen replayable fiveten,1
even if you know absolutely nothing about ireland you have to love my left foot and especially daniel daylewis performance in it he plays cerebral palsyafflicted christy brown due to this he has spent most of his life ostracized even when trying to warn people about something they just laugh at him the light in the darkness for him is that he has control over one body part his left foot he uses that appendage to paint and write poetry bringing him to prominencedaniel daylewis and director jim sheridan did very well on this collaboration and also on a later collaboration in the name of the father but the boxer was unnecessary my left foot can make you feel many ways sad hopeful or something else but in any case daniel daylewis gave the performance of a lifetime here a great movie in every sense,1
when american author edgar allan poe visits london he is approached by british journalist alan foster who becomes the target of a peculiar wager not believing poes assertion that all of his macabre stories have been based on actual experience foster accepts a bet from poe and his friend sir thomas blackwood that he cannot spend an entire night in the blackwoods haunted castle once installed in the abandoned castle foster discovers that he is not alone as he is approached by various beautiful women and handsome men and a doctor of metaphysics  who explains that they are all lost souls damned to replay the stories of their demises on the anniversary of their deaths the first time i watched this glorious bit of classic horror i was mesmerized the entire time i found the movie genuinely creepy and at the same time sorrowful babs steele is undeniably beautiful the music score makes the atmosphere twice as terror inducing the topless scene threw me for a loop as i was not expecting it it looks as synapse did a great job with picture enhancement because this movie looks damn fine for its age and it is the uncut international version to boot this is the movie responsible for me starting a babs steele and klaus kinski collection,1
hearing such praise about this play i decided to watch it when i stumbled across it on cable i do not see how this elivates women and their struggles by focusing on the topic at hand i guess if you have an interest in stories about womens private parts and how it affects their lives then this is for you otherwise it is rather dull and boring if anything i found it a bit degradingi inquired with a female friend who also watched this and she thought it was horrible as well so it is not just a guy not getting it,0
this movie was promising my favorite actor in a historical drama during the independence war it had memories from dances with wolves for the big prairies indians military fights  from barry lyndon for the british  candles lights atmospheresunfortunately the script is awful the continuity of the story is lacking cuts with five months later three years later  the romance is so ridiculous that it is hard to believe in it america is a big country but the characters kept bumping at each other above all wait for the ending  you understand how to kill a story imagine the same in titanicsometimes a bad script is saved by a brilliant filmmaker unfortunately bis hudson is a poor one he has already committed greystoke and i find again the same flaws no dynamic in scenes in editing in scoring it is long dull flati knew that this movie was a disaster for pacinos career now i understand finally this last movie for two thousand and six is in the vein of this year for me a painful one,0
it is a good thing i did not watch this while i was pregnanti definitely would have cried my eyes out andor vomit it was kind of gruesome mainly disturbing i personally thought the baby was adorable in its own twisted little wayhowever as a mom i cringed when beth stabbed herself in the stomach and when virgina aborted the child during her threerd trimester with rusty utensils no lessalsoas an animal lover i almost cried when she scratched the cat to a bloody pulphoweveras creepy and sinister as the baby was i was rooting for it to liveand as twisted as the movie was i am extremely intrigued to see the sequel       ,0
just looking at the sets staging and editing it is easy to tell this project lacked a proper budget maybe bela lugosi is meant to take your mind off of things like that young brides drop dead at the altar after saying i do their corpses are stolen by a renowned horticulturist dr lorenzlugosiand a couple of his freakish minions as his aging wifeelizabeth russellneeds injections of the glandular fluids of the young virgins to remain forever youngforever beautiful an eager local cub reporterluana waltersrealizes that each missing bride wore the same rare orchid to the altar an orchid in which dr lorenz would be most knowledgeable a typical horror movie storm brews making a visit to the lorenz estate a bit spooky especially with a dwarf and a slobbering hunchback on the premises other players angelo rossitto tristram coffin minerva urecal and frank moran,0
without reiterating what was said above about this movie i would like to add that i was looking forward to watching this filmthe castlocation and the work of the excellent director michael winterbottom etcit had a vague shadow of do not look now about the storyline from the beginning a stay in different surroundings italy again to dim the heartbreak of lossor perhaps that is how i saw it so consequently i sat there waiting for the story to unfold and put a spin on what we expect to happen to this family in a foreign european countryand i sat there and sat thereand guess what nothing actually happens and i mean nothing you are not even given the chance to get into the characters as they are so one dimensional and vacuousyou are led to believe from the pace of the movie that something was going to happen to turn the whole film on it is headthe eldest daughters flirtation with the local vespa boys had great scope to take the movie in another direction the youngest daughters visions of her dead mother ended up being a fruitless and pointless exercise the fathers attempts at being seduced by one of his female students felt ridiculous given his age it felt as if the script had a last recall made where they decided at the last minute to eradicated any guts to the story and went for paring it down to a bare minimum to no effect when the credits started to roll unexpectedly you cannot help but feel robbed of your time spent sat watching this pile of rubbish,0
i went to go see this at the esquire theatre in cincy oh and  i hate my life nowchristopher reeves would have been a more believable boxeras a film it was painful but seeing bret carr in person was to see desperation at its pinnaclemy favorite part of the movie was seeing because slammed in the face with what appeared to be a c battery the jury is still out on this it was from a dildo and it was in slowmo yepshoot the left side of the face onlypeople become famous by demanding things  bret carr b carr donned a chicken suit for a bit of reverse psychology roaming the streets of clifton bashing his own film he should this is correct to bash the filmmy soul felt chafed after this moviebret carr is not charismatic enough to be the leader of a cult or smart enough for that matter that is the feeling you get from the what the bleepesque trickle of brainwashed impressionable neoyuppies that came to see this bret carr piece of workit is an emotionally draining experience just thinking about writing about this film so goodbyeanonymous,0
i am far from a sylvester stallone fan and i guess the only time i really appreciated his appearance was in the french movie taxi three which is an almost inexistent small role and yet i must admit that this movie was actually not that bad even though i feared the worstwhen gabe stallone fails to rescue the girlfriend of one of his friends and she plunges to her death from a four thousand feet high mountain top he cannot possibly force himself to keep working as a mountain ranger for almost a year he does not set a food in the reserve but than he returns soon after he is back they get an emergency call from a group of hikers who got trapped in a snow storm at least that is what the rangers believe in reality it is a group of robbers who crashed with their airplane in the mountains after their daring plan to steal cases full of money from a flying government plane failed the cases are spread all over the reserve and they need the help of professional climbers to retrieve themthis is of course not one of the most intelligent movies ever but in its genre it is an enjoyable one i especially enjoyed john lithgow as the evil master mind and leader of the gang of robbers i know him best from the tvseries threerd rock from the sun but i enjoyed his performance in this movie as well overall the acting is ok it had a lot of action to offer and of course also some oneliners but it also offered a very nice decor this movie was filmed in a magnificent natural environment i loved the snowy mountains and valleys the mountain rivers and the forests perhaps that is why i give this movie a score higher than what i normally give to an action  adventure movie of this kind i give it a sixfiveten if you do not expect too much this is an enjoyable movie,1
they made me watch this in school and it was terrible the movie is outdated the episodes become confusing because fact is combined with fiction to make the story more interestingthe teachers talked about it as a treat but really it was a painfully boring experiencei have read that very few people who appear in this are actors but most of them them do what they do in the movie in real lifethis accounts for cheesy acting very often also very often the story becomes mildly outrageous and farfetched i do not like the way some of the lines were written and wish they had more meaning to them though it was written to be educational funny suspenseful and hip it ended up being boring dry farfetched and old i hope no one takes time to watch this movie because you would be just fine not seeing it,0
if this series supposed to be an improvement over batman  the animated series i for one think it failed terribly the character drawing is lousy catwoman for instance looks awful but what really annoyed me is that it made batman look like a sort of wimp who just cannot take care of himself in a battle without the help of two even three sidekicks i mean he is batman for gods sake i know the comic books i know that nightwing and batgirl are supposed to be batmans allies besides robin but still making batman say that he needs help from them what he cannot handle a few punches in btas he could face a dozen adversaries without any problem he is getting old come onand another thing i really do not think that batman would allow a kid like tim drake to go into battle that soon without years of hard training one it is irresponsible and batman is everything but irresponsible and two it is not what happened in the comics if we are to remain faithful to thembatman  the animated series made history with its animation its stories and its characters that really was a legend of batman the new adventures series turned the legend into just another batman flick,0
i only watched this film from beginning to end because i promised a friend i would it lacks even unintentional entertainment value that many bad films have it may be the worst film i have ever seen i am surprised a distributor put their name on it,0
although i rated this movie a two for showing a complete lack of effort in trying to create a quality horror film it was a ten on the unintentional funny scale i could not figure out what was going on in the movie or who the people were but i did not care because i knew every scene was going to have something to make me cry with laughter dialogue is a minimum throughout the movie but i believe this is because they started filming without a script the fact that there is no plot line makes the movie extremely versatile it does not matter if you sit down and watch the movie from beginning to end or if you watch it in rewind you will be confused with enjoyment i particularly like the scene in which the inmates are taking turns running around outside beating each other with sticks i believe the doctor refers to this as treatment genius,0
somerset maughams characters are brought to life in rkos of human bondage but the movie is a too skeletal version of the novel with bette davis starmaking performance sucking up all of the energy otherwise it is the story of leslie howard as philip carey he dreams of becoming a painter but is told he has no talent for the arts as the film progresses mr howards struggles instead to become a doctor his efforts seem to indicate some bad advice regarding the arts though successful in medicine his painting seemed easier  also note the symbolism of his disability a club foot explained in the filmalong the way right away in this version howard becomes infatuated with waitress davis as mildred rogers davis characterization of mildred is extraordinary culminating in a spectacular speech when she tells howard among other things that she had to wipe my mouth after kissing him howard also performs well but the story fails to explain his prolonged fascination and love for davis so their performances are wasted still a film to watch for the acting including some good supporting players bette davis characterization was famous for inspiring a writein campaign for the one thousand nine hundred and thirtyfour best actress academy award for the record she placed third the results were one claudette colbert  it happened one night two norma shearer  the barretts of wimpole street three bette davis  of human bondage four grace moore  one night of love  of human bondage sixtwentyeightthirtyfour john cromwell  leslie howard bette davis reginald denny,1
after looking at monkeys oops apes for more than one hour i was feeling like one too i was an ape spending money on this movie please people hold you money in your pocket and go see some funny movie like bridget joness diary,0
a wonderful free flowing often lyrical film that whisks you along ever smiling even if there are truly shocking incidents along the way one gasps at the way the women are treated and yet ultimately they seem to come through very well and it is much credit to all concerned that so many potentially disastrous scenes all work so very well this is possibly depardieus best performance certainly his most natural jeanne moreau performs outstandingly in what must have been a very difficult role to play and including vigorous sex scenes with a couple of guys at least half her age mioumiou is lovely throughout and again has very difficult scenes to play initially this seems a down and dirty misogynist rantromp but as the tale and characters unfold a much more tender and honest picture emerges in the end this uncompromising and daring film demands respect,1
an inconvenient truth is as entirely simplistic and demagogic as the turgid slop created by the rabid and idiotic republicans it meanders along intangible lines until it attempts to gorge something into your face namely that we will all be dead in a few hundred years which is already indisputable but who cares humans are selfish destructive creatures i frankly do not waste my time caring about human extinction i will just call it a natural progression let the apocalypse begin but meanwhile we have to listen to the same brazen slanted politicians who propose another new society well do not be fooled we will all still be controlled by the wealthy by those in power and by those idiots who created the catastrophes in the first place nothing will ever changeal gore whose hypocrisy is quite evident in the film as he is being driven in a gas guzzling car all alone using a consumerist computer he also lives on huge acres of land in a rather large mansion the land itself was used for destructive erosive purposes including cattle tobacco pig farming which accounts for methane gas traces and who knows what else his wealth is predicated on exploitation greed and his investments include numerous large companies in the world with disputable records i hardly think this man is qualified to lecture the less fortunate but his prestige is based on his opposition to another ludicrous political party that is all meanwhile he emits those very same rancid characteristics that make politics and politicians so appalling this bozo happens to be living the comfortable life and yet he is lecturing poor people in africa about crop farming and cut and burn techniques he travels across the world in first class seats in fuel wasting jets uses product placed computers in the documentary and yet he thinks everything is a moral issue he is entirely absorbed in his own deluded nightmares he says he came to these conclusions because of the death of his sister from tobacco induced cancer and the near death of his son by an automobile of all things did he fight against the tobacco companies or propose that automobiles be banned because they are dangerous hulking machines no everything must serve the economy so why is he any different the answer is he is nothis forlorn and exhausted attempts at humanistic philosophy are disastrous all this while he is being filmed in the forest or along a little river eschewing stale life affirming quotes well mr gore why do not you try living like the common people then he is a politician plain and simple he has a career invested in the power structure my question is why does not he concentrate on the powerful industrial nations of the earth who are to blame for most of the complications he does not do that because it would be unwise for investments stocks and corporationsal gore gives monotonous lectures about the subject in the documentary namely to wealthy white people in the audience who clap on cue while showing them graph charts numbers and percentages and speaking in a dreary tone no one without a harvard which the elites control education can make sense out of it but he tells us everything is going to hell no kidding but i think he fails to account for this problem precisely in the approach that capitalism has taken for the planet namely that it is expendable and a waste dump he never once mentions how industrialization has created these problems he just wants to put mild bandages on them but not eradicate the whole oppressive system its obvious he was spoiled sent to the schools for elites and has the same basic temperament for politics as any other back stabbing inconsistent dullard in washington whoever made this propaganda as it is in no way different than what the republicans have conceived had only goals in mind that were directed by capitalistic impulse that is to say someone is going to benefit and it seems the new green politicians who support venture capitalist companies who are buying up hordes of land in an attempt to develop the new utopian future with new technologies it is the same old story al gore is a believer in the elitist structure he actually believes there is a democracy in the us which i find very naive if we are not paying wages to the oil companies then we will be paying them to the wind and solar companiesi find the speech at the end quite rancid along the lines of something gw bush would have oozed over to the dumb downed masses gore speaks about people uniting together to defeat communism in the one thousand nine hundred and ninetys what it had to do with global warming absolutely nothing but he attempts to get base emotions ruminating in people with that said he did not understand that communism never existed in the world the systems in europe and ussr were merely a tyrannical form of authoritarianism and capitalism no less different than what controls the us interests social ecology was not even mentioned here which is really a travesty if you want to change the world then one must dispose of those antiquated systems that are based on greed exploitation and violence,0
a dreary hopelessly predictable film set in a most unpleasant setting lower coachella valley acting is as amateurish as any i have seen looks like a screenwriting one hundred and one script however it does function as a great sedative,0
here is an indie film i really wanted to like but ultimately could not the lack of script boldly proclaimed in the main titles really shows through and kills the picture the story is a nonsensical mess that is not worth trying to figure out i quickly became bored within ten minutes then suffered through the remainder of the first forty minuteshoping for the bestbefore hitting the chapter stops to mercifully get to the end even that was not worth the extra effort ozark savage clearly tries too hard to be clever lifting its best sequences from evil dead two and the matrix as a result there is very little in ozark savage that has not been done before and better this film would have been much more fun as a tentwenty minute short but as a feature it just feels padded and forced of course there is no money in shorts so i completely understand the financial reasons that i assume motivated it being stretched out to seventyfive minutes director matt steinauer shows great promise and i wish him luck,0
neither the total disaster the uk critics claimed nor the misunderstood masterpiece its few fanboys insist revolver is at the very least an admirable attempt by guy ritchie to add a little substance to his conman capers but then nothing is more despised than an ambitious film that bites off more than it can chew especially one using the gangsterconartist movie framework as might be expected from luc bessons name on the credits as producer there is a definite element of cinema de look about it set in a kind of realistic fantasy world where america and britain overlap it looks great has a couple of superbly edited and conceived action sequences and oozes style all of which mark it up as a disposable entertainment but ritchie clearly wants to do more than simply rehash his own movies for a fast buck and he is spent a lot of time thinking and reading about life the universe and everything if anything its problem is that he is trying to throw in too many influences a bit of machiavelli a dash of godard a lot of the principles of chess motifs and techniques littering the screen with quotes the film was originally intended to end with three minutes of epigrams over photos of corpses of mob victims and at times it feels as if he never read a fortune cookie he did not want to turn into a movie rather than a commercial for kabbalism it is really more a mixture of the overlapping principles of commerce chess and confidence trickery that for the most part pulls off the difficult trick of making the theosophy accessible while hiding the films central somewhat metaphysical conthe last third is where most of the problems can be found as jason statham takes on the enemy literally within with lots of ambitious but not always entirely successful crosscutting within the frame to contrast peoples exterior bravado with their inner fear and anger but it is got a lot going for it all the same not worth starting a new religion over but i am surprised it did not get a us distributor maybe they found ray liottas intentionally fake tan just too damn scary,1
threelbs is obviously just a self indulgent programme for stanley tucci to be a producermoody deep doctor unlike house he has absolutely no personality and unlike greys anatomy the brain surgery cases aret even interesting this programme is supposed to be set in a leading centre for neurlogical cases  yet there is nothing interesting or exciting going on not even the so called pathetic feud between him and a rival adds anything to the show and neither do those hallucinations in the pilot there was a brief glimpse into the leadss social life as a father  snooze boring and pointlessthis show is pantsthere is a glut of medical dramas around at the moment and this does nothing to make it stand out as special,0
i caught the last half of this movie on cable one night and was struck by just how morbid it was even when one of the two victims is at his most deteriorated the camera keeps going the lingering shots of his corpse being uncovered and his concentrationcamp figure being zipped into a body bag are both moving and depressing do not watch this movie if your already depressed then again do not watch it if your feeling really good,1
do not listen to the misleading title werewolf woman the europeans are well known for putting an emphasis on sex and nudity over actual scares in their horror films but this one here is just a bit too much werewolf woman seems to have a sleazy sex scene copped off with the title character going crazy and brutally killing her partner fun the first few times but a hundred minutes of this becomes very monotonous quickly she is not even a werewolf but a schizo chick whose ancestor was hanged for lycanthropy the film cannot even decide its tone with the first ten minutes a flashback being legitimate supernatural horror i thought i was in for a trash classic after these to a rather poor character study of the female being repeatedly abused and tortured to a revenge thriller at the end the director insists this is based on a true story yeah all rightto be fair there are a few entertaining aspects of the production the title werewolf woman is a looker and there are a few nice gore effects and nude scenes however these become rather monotonous quickly also the dubbed dialog is pretty hilarious in a camp fashion especially the worlds most swinging doctor he drinks on the job unfortunately the film becomes pretty irritating fast there is no actual plot or anything else really its a shame because reading a description i felt the film had some real potential werewolf woman is far overlong slow moving and a bit too pointless even by the standards of the exploitation genre fourten,0
city hall is a somewhat mixed bag part vignettes of nyc political life and part moralizing tale al pacino a dukakisesque boss with presidential dreams gives an oft times sullen or subdued performance there is a couple times when he chews the scenery and in the case of city hall this is where he shines john cusack gives a subdued and generally flawless performance without going into caricature of a new orleans dialect or sliding into melodrama during the films climax danny aiello as a burrough political chief is also very good i love showtunes toothe major problem with city hall and it is a good movie in many ways is the general feeling of a lack of momentum it comes off more like a documentary than a motion picture we see the action or follow the story from a detached perspective and naturally the viewer does not become involved when the viewer does not get involved to a certain degree they become apathetic towards the characters and eventually the plotthis tends to alienate and what should have been a riveting detail divulging finale came off as a hmmmuhokay they say you cannot fight city hall as the tread worn cliche goes yet it still cannot stop you from thinking what might have been if they had just tightened up the screenplay and pacing of this movie,1
at one end of the eighties warren beatty created and starred in the literate epic reds about the founding of the soviet union as seen through the eyes of iconoclast radical john reed it was a profound film both entertaining and with a message presented by an all star cast at the end of the decade warren beatty created another kind of epic in dick tracy that makes no pretense to being anything other than entertainment with a whole bunch of the best actors around just having a great old time hamming it up under tons of makeupthat both reds and dick tracy could come from the same individual speaks volumes about the range this man has as a player in this film beatty managed to get all the famous cartoon characters from the strip and put them in one original screenplaythe citys top mobster big boy caprice is making a move to really eliminate competition the film opens with him rubbing out lips manliss henchmen in a valentine massacre style shooting and then lips himself being fitted for a cement overcoat but caprices moves are making him a target for tracyin the meantime a third mysterious and faceless individual is looking to topple caprice himself will our hero sort out this thicket of crimethe spirit of fun this film has is truly infectious when people like al pacino dustin hoffman paul sorvino william forsythe rg armstrong get themselves outrageously madeup to look like the cartoon creations of strip author chester gould and then indulge in an exercise of carving the biggest slice of ham you have got to love this filmal pacino got a nomination for best supporting actor but any of these guys could have it is only that pacino as big boy caprice gets the most screen time only beatty plays it completely straight the others all seem to play off of him dick tracy won oscars for best artset design best song written by stephen sondheim and introduced by madonna sooner or later the fact he was even able to get somebody like sondheim to write a score for this film only shows sondheim wanted to get in on the fun as for madonna the material girl does more than hold her own with all these acting heavyweights as club torch singer breathless mahoneybefore this film dick tracy movies were consigned to the b pictures and worse as saturday afternoon serials the only thing that rivals this all star extravaganza is a radio broadcast done for armed forces radio during world war ii that got to vinyl can you believe a cast like bing crosby bob hope frank sinatra dinah shore jimmy durante judy garland frank morgan and the andrews sisters try and find a recording of that gemuntil then warren beattys classic comic strip for the big screen will do nicely,1
this is part one of a short animation clip showing the history of the matrix the war between man and machine that resulted in the eventual creation of the matrix the animation is part japanese anime part contemporary american animation and is very well made considering the excellent directors behind the movie it shows the initial development of ai and the exploitation of the machines by man until the day they rebelled,1
justifications for what happened to his movie in terms of distributors and secondary directors drunks and receptionists doing script rewrites aside let us just take this movie as it is offered without extraneous explanationsthis movie is god awful straight up craptastic rather than rehash what may serve as a plot i will run a highlight reel of some curious points that made me scratch my heada class of five take a field trip for a history class to the middle of friggin nowhere ireland these students may be canadian or american it is difficult to tell that it was filmed in a canadian forest rather than ireland is rather obvious as well one student seems to know nothing about history and is basically the dumb jock character from a number of kick ass eightys movie except when he channels randy from scream one character may be chris kleins stunt double he has a girlfriend who probably gets killed but it is never really established if that is true one character is sullen and removed from her peersjustcuz and then there is a blonde girl yay blonde girlireland has a population of two they are cousins gary who is clearly the same age or younger than the rest of the cast is called sir more than once he is very ominous and wears a knit cap his cousin is a roughed up porn star with the worst irish accent to befoul film in my lifetime and most likely beyondpicturesque ireland features many canadian forests and swampy areas and two ducks which appear more than once in cut scenesthe producers got a discount on volume fake entrails good for themunbeknownst to me horribly inbred freaks have access to brand spanking new hunting knives perhaps there is some kind of outdoorsman outlet nearby with a blind and deaf clerk working the registeralso unbeknownst to me if you inbreed for roughly six hundred years as the story leads us to believe happened you end up being somewhat lumpy yet amazingly spry and fairly strong genetics are a wonderful game of crapsthere may or may not be more than one freak in this film reference is made to them and we see shadows yet only one odd looking dude is seen ever and when one odd looking dude is finally killed apparently all danger is passed i am running with my initial assumption that no one thought to outfit a second man in full make up thus they just used the one that is what it looks like on screen anywayrichard grieco should be ashamedalso of note aside from those shiny new knives the inbred freaks have access to some posh leather gear as once richard grieco cuts his bonds there are fresh ones ready for the next sucker who gets tied upwho also then escapes because the chains give you enough slack to just undo them making one wonder why they even bother tying anyone upa dead body in a shack will be maggotridden after what i would guess is about two hours has passed said dead body will also have glasses on when no characters wore them curiousjenna jameson appears for no reason from stage left chats for two minutes vanishes stage left in the middle of a giant forest that is not unusual as gary can also pop out of nowhere which is also known as whatever exists in tv land off the screenms jameson dies sadly and somehow her clothes vanish like my hopes that this movie would not suck windi offer a special nod to the breeder character the poor girl who has been used by the freaks for months or maybe years for breeding purposes the poor girl who still has eye shadow on and emotes on camera with all the passion and conviction of a stuffed chihuahuathe ending of this movie was clearly tacked on by a drunk or someone with a fierce mental disability that has been cultivated and encouraged with excessive gasoline drinking over the yearsapparently this was not just random crap i found on the movie network late at night apparently people have heard of and even followed this movie through it is production how sad for you all i have nothing more to say may god have mercy on us all,0
not being familiar with us television stations when i flicked onto this on my inlaws cable first i thought it was just a lowbudget scifi film then after a couple of minutes i started thinking it might be a clever satire on the worst excesses of christian fundamentalist and then it dawned on me  good grief these people are serious it is been a while since i saw anything so unintentionally hilarious i hesitated about writing a review of this for fear of offending believers but then i saw other reviews and thought hey they can take it tough philosophical conundrum how do you make a movie criticizing movies without actually showing what it is you are criticizing answer make it in such a way that the only people who will appreciate it are people who hate the kind of movies you are criticizing i suppose some liberals ugh spit when you say that might be offended at the filmmakers contempt for those in the audience who are not obsessed with the j c myth but i did not mind  it was so darn funny,0
very interesting the big twist was not as big a shock as maybe they had hoped for and it was very dated but it did get my mind working it really got me thinking about a world without vegetation or livestock and made me appreciate the world i live in a lot more charlton heston does a good job as do all the supporting characters and it was a very realistic film which was surprising it lacked direction at times and a lot of the settings and background needed more explanation but it was still a surprisingly good and intelligent movie the main fault that i could find was that i did not want the film to end when it did i would have liked to see what happened nextseventen,1
i only saw this movie once and that was enough for me the movie has very little if any plot and seems to be nothing but continuous scenes of psychosadistic violence and very little of anything else i wanted to see this movie because it starred zoe trilling of the second night of the demons and i wanted to see her playing someone normal unfortunately the tobe hooper script barely begins and goes nowhere as robert englund dominates the film and chews up the scenery and plot zoe i know where you are now hiding from this film ,0
this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen however the little slave girl alice and jared harris imitating christopher walken is what makes this movie entertaining alices smoking drinking and uncanny way of showing up when her name is called is strange and interesting i have to applaud jared for his christopher walken imitation and christopher walken for allowing this to be in the movie,0
this is just one more of those hideous films that you find on lifetime tv which portray the abhorrent behavior of some disgusting woman in an empathetic manner along with other such nasty films as the burning bed enough or monster this film takes a disgusting criminal and attempts to show the viewer why she is not such a bad person after all give us a break here is my question to the filmmakers if letourneau were a man and vili were a twelve year old girl would you have made a picture sympathizing and empathizing with this person answer hell noimagine switching the genders in this film and then you will see just why myself and others here consider this a worthless piece of garbage were the genders switched there would be no attempt to empathize with the criminal instead we would likely be treated to a portrayal of a monstrous and hideous man preying upon a young girl his lascivious behavior landing him in prison and his brainwashed victim suffering from stockholm syndrome the only reason letourneau does not receive the same treatment in this film is by virtue of her sexlet us call a spade a spade letourneau is a pedophile plain and simple no ifs ands or buts she is a criminal who belongs in prison and deserves our derision and contempt but certainly not our pity or empathy,0
much as we all love al pacino it was painful to see him in this movie a publicity hack at the grubby ending of what seems to have once been a distinguished and idealistic career pacino plays his part looking like an unmade bed and assaulting everyone with a totally bogus and inconsistent southern accentthe plot spools out this way and that with so many loose ends and improbabilities that the mind reels and then retreatskim basinger is there not doing much her scenes with pacino are flat and unconvincing hard to believe they meant a lot to each other there is no energy theretea leone on the other hand lit up the screen she was electric and her scenes with pacino were by far the most interesting in the movie but not enough to save al from embarrassment,0
franco rossis one thousand nine hundred and eightyfive sixhour italian miniseries of quo vadis is a very curious beast creating an absolutely convincing ancient roman world shot in matter of fact fashion very few long shots no big cityscapes but playing the drama down so much in favour of allusions to classical literature and history that the story constantly gets lost in the backgroundthe shifting structure much of episode one is played out via voice over letters and lack of narrative urgency makes the full sixhour version simultaneously demanding and undemanding and certainly far too often uninvolving but it has something going for it the two main strengths are the characterisation of petronius a thankfully dubbed frederic forrest whose own voice would almost certainly flatten his dialogue as a man whose spent so long looking for an astute angle to survive court life that he is become incapable of experiencing emotion and klaus maria brandauers unique take on nero as a wannabe actor whose every move and action is calculated on how his audience will receive it elsewhere max von sydow briefly appears in a few episodes being rewarded with the shows most impressive and genuinely moving scene here he encounters a child as he attempts to leave rome it is the kind of thing the show could do with more of but it seems all too often to flatten every potentially emotional inspiring or exciting moment under it is relentlessly lowkey directionunfortunately francesco quinn makes a staggeringly anonymous hero blending in with the walls and coming over less as a roman officer than that quiet slightly gormless but inoffensive guy who works in the same office as you who never says much at office parties  you know the one who you think is called dave or something like that the budgetary limitations are very visible once its meet the lions time for the christians and ursus battle with the bull is so determinedly low key that it just passes over you before the show just abruptly loses interest and suddenly endsnot a trip i can particularly recommend i am afraid but if you do embark on it it is one not entirely without its small rewards,0

i caught this movie at a small screening held by members of my colleges gaming club we were forewarned that this would be the reefer madness of gaming and this movie more than deliveredtom hanks plays robbie a young man restarting his college career after resting for a semester what we the viewer find out as the movie progresses is that robbie was hopelessly addicted to a roleplaying game called mazes and monsters a game that he gets reacquainted with after a gaming group recruit him for a campaignthis movie is laughable on many many levels one scene features the group gaming by candlelight which is probably the best way i can describe it while i am sure that this was meant to be cultish in some way as most gamers know it is horribly inaccurate most roleplay sessions are done in welllit rooms usually over some cheetohs and a can of sodathe acting while not oscarcaliber is not gutwrenchingly awful either this is one of tom hankss first roles and bosom buddies and bachelor party were still a year or two over the horizon the supporting cast while not very memorable still hand forth decent performancesmainly the badness lies in the fact that it was a madefortv movie that shows the dangers of gaming worth a view if you and your friends are planning a bad movie night,0
i am terribly sorry i know that faßbinder still is called one of the greatest directors in postwar germany and that most of his films are considered masterpieces but when i see lili marleen today in two thousand and four i wonder what everyone is up and away about this movie the acting is simply terrible  hanna schygulla is all the smiling like an idiot  the changings between naziglamour and battlefields are ridiculous the whole film looks as if it was made within two days in an attic probably it was exactly that way and many people seem to take this for real art but for me this movie is simply bad  cheap compare this to viscontis la caduta degli dei and tell me again that lili marleen is a good movie,0
i have never read the booka wrinkle in time to be perfectly honesty after seeing the movie do i really want to well i should not be reviewing this movie i will start off with that next i will say that the tv movie is pretty forgettable do you know why i say that because i forgot what happens in it i told you it was forgettable to be perfectly honest no tv movie will ever be better than merlinhow do i describe a tv movie i have never written a review for one before well i will just say that they usually have some celebrities a wrinkle in time includes only one alfre woodardor woodward i am not sure the oscar winner the film has cheesy special effects a mildly interesting plot scenes that make you go wtf the movie is incredibly bad and it makes you gowtf what did i expect it is a tv movie they usually are not good as is this one a wrinkle in time is a waste of time and a big time waster to top it off you will most likely forget about it the second it is over well maybe not the second it is over but within a few minutesa wrinkle in time,0
other reviewers here seem to think this is an awful film that is simply not true and a little unfairthe acting is of a good quality and the direction moves on with a decent fluidity i do not think there is anything wrong with the tarantinoesquire way of interlocking stories together perhaps its just a new tool for directors to try i thought it made the film much more interesting perhaps a few elements of the script need tightening but that is about the only fault i can find nestor cantillana gives a great performance as sylvio also antonella rios is stunning and worth the price of admission alone,1
may i start off by saying that casey affleck is a very talented actor and i respect his work very much i wish he was in more movies that showcased his talent with this said soul survivors was a very very bad movie very badi would have to say that i lay almost all the blame on the poor script affleck is a very talented actress wes bentley had an outstanding performance in american beauty melissa sagemiller did well and eliza dushku is currently the it girl in hollywood i do not think any of the actors really got into the script and i understand why to say that this movie belongs to the horror genre is an overstatement it did have the twists and turns you would expect but they just did not lead anywhere except to more confusion i just found the ending very anticlimatic because it just did not seem to make any sense or really answer any of the questions that i had about the storylinei wish i could give this movie a good review but i cannot in all honesty the only thing i think you will find scary about this movie is that you paid for it,0
this was a quite brutal movie there were huge implausibilities and a silly script bad acting etcthe only reason to watch this movie is that from time to time some quite impressive sets of breasts were exposed,0
i am writing this because i somehow felt being led to believe dark remains was a good movie whilst it is not the worst i have seen it certainly is not gooda weak script weak actors and weak directing even if they cannot afford big name cast would it be too much to ask for a more attractive lead actress it was painful to watch a plain actress through out the film with her dull performance the story was a cliché and poorly scripted the special effects were minimal the suspense tricks employed repetitively here were hard to swallowto be fair dark remains is no worse than quite some of the masters of horrors episodes but not quite on par with quality movies yet dark remains is only recommended for the hardcore horror fans who do not want to miss any movie in the genre even if it is a poorly made one as for anyone else time should be spent on something more valuable  which should be extremely easy,0
the john van druten broadway hit is brought to the screen with a maximum of star power in this romantic fantasy about a modernday witch who beguiles a successful manhattan publisher james stewart may get top billing but it is kim novak who steals the show as one of the most alluring witches ever to cast a spell on the movie screen the lead pairing is in fact one of the movies few weaknesses the grayhaired stewart seems a bit old for the role and while it is easy to see why he falls hard for novak it is a little harder to understand what she finds attractive about him as they seem mismatched in temperment and outlook it is one of the storys amusing conceits that witches and warlocks are portrayed as greenwich village beatniks and bohemians curiously the stewartnovak pairing would generate a lot more heat in vertigo released the same year as this film but then vertigo had a compelling suspense story and the benefit of alfred hitchcocks directionthe films comic moments are mostly provided by the stellar supporting cast including a young jack lemmon as kims warlock brother elsa lanchester their ditzy aunt and ernie kovacs  as a befuddled writer hermione gingold even shows up in a hilarious cameo as a sort of grand witch there is lots to like in this moviewit romance and a great castthat is if you can possibly take your eyes off the enchanting miss novak i have seen the movie a half a dozen times and i never can,1
one thousand nine hundred and eightyfive was a good year for films  maybe even great  but this one missing out on a gong went a long way to convincing fans that old oscar is little more that a hood ornament for good party memberseleven nominations and not a single title such was the academys disdain for one of their greatest directors and one who had to wait another eight years before whatever prejudices had prevented them from handing him the statue before allowed them to give him seven for schindlers list which is arguably not as good and i am halfpolishdo not get me wrong schindler was a classic and i am not knocking out of africa which won that year either but it was in my mind a class behind this one an epic story of suffering and hope that brought me to tears  and i am not a big cryermaybe it was the music superb or the cinematography sumptuous but more likely simply the acting whoopi who proved to all of us that she was much more than just a comedienne danny glover who i would never heard of before and of course oprahthe rest is history but at the time who knew,1
i have seen most of ryuhei kitamuras work and i have come to the conclusion that he has a knack for action scenes are kinetic and fast often combining elements of martial arts gun fights and samurai fights with camera work that effectively captures the on screen carnage with versus and aragami kitamura demonstrated that creativity and showed that he his more than capable of working with a low budget so what happened in alive  to be more blunt the answer would be  nothing nothing happened in alive it was a two hours plus movie with little to no action and little to no characters and plotadapted from a comic book by tsutomu takahashi alive is an examination of the life of one tenshu yashiro played by hideo sasaki a death row convict who survives his execution he is then given a choice of either to repeat the execution or to subject himself in a bizarre series of experiments he chooses the latter and soon after that is placed in a room along with a rapist and later with a girl infected with a strange parasite that in exchange for it is hosts humanity grants supernatural powers naturaly at some point that parasite moves into yashiro the bad thing is that does not happen very soon similar to aragami alive sets it is first half in establishing the basic exposition characters are introduced their motivations are set and their relations between each other are uncovered the whole thing even takes place in just one set the first major problem of that comparison is that while aragami was just a seventy minute movie alive drags on for more than two hours thus making the first part over one hour long that length could have been justified had the characters been made a bit more interesting but alas that is not the case dialogue is dry monotonous delivered without any sense of emotion or depth characters themselves are not much interesting there were some small attempts at making alive a bit more moral ambiguous but in the end it all came down to the classic  evil government people against superpowered protagonist whom yes you guessed it saves the girl in the end like i previously said the entire film practically takes place at just one set and after two hours that does get boring even worse the set design itself was not even interesting to begin with and does not do much to improve on other aspects of the filmnow after that first part is over one might think that kitamura would at least make some entertaining action scenes to make up for the boring beginning sadly that is not the case the two only fights are actually rehashes of similar fights from hollywood movies complete with bullet time effects and psychic powers they are just not interesting or fun kitamuras creativity from versus is gone the small set even limits his often very impressive camerawork and it all boils down into generic and expectable fights a shame reallyevidently aragami was better on all accounts and kitamura had learned something from alive so it was not at least a total loss watching this movie if only to understand the errors made how to fix them and create a better more entertaining movie,0
having heard so much about the one thousand nine hundred and ninetys cracker series without seeing any of them i looked forward to this eagerly surely the combination of jimmie mcgovern and robbie coltrane could not go wrong how wrong i was the polemics backed by frequent repetitive and violent flashbacks were overpowering the production tried to be supermodern but the flashing boxes and even the childish font irritated robbie coltrane sleepwalked through the two hours coming up with unexplained and unlikely insights and the police were portrayed as onedimensional bumbling idiots as a result the tension never built up and the nexttofinal scene no details for fear of spoilers was as laughably bad a piece of tv drama as i have seen for a long timeno i do not want to see any more of these but i will go back to the dvds of the one thousand nine hundred and ninetys series to see if they match their reputation,0
i am from sweden and i have just seen this movie and the thing is that i thought it was okay i have seen many bad comments about it but you must remember that a lot of people that watch this two parts miniseries are located all over the world and not just in usa also remember that not everyone has ever heard of the film made in the sixtys and maybe not in the eventsmurders and even morethat it can be hard to find the original movie and if so there always be people around that does not like blackwhite films this one feels fresh and in color and will find its public its twelve years old now but i just saw it for the first time i will try to find the first one if i can to compare them but i have not seen it anywhere in sweden ofcorse there is internet but not for anyone in the world the thing here is that this is mostly part of an american crimehistory and was big in the fiftysixtys in just usa but in rest of the world it just past by i guess well it was told about for some time but forty years later it will fade away in for example europa because time goes by we had our own problems and crimes so if someone will do a remake of the film and put it back in some light again its not a bad idea at all a new generation can take part of this horrible story and even the film about capote that was released just a few years ago witch was a pretty good film too i think it will boost interest to the events that took place some fifty years ago and maybe stop it to fall in sleep it started me up and now i am looking for the robert blakeversion so it was not that badhuh this are my opinions some people will of course disagree but heyits okay sometimes there will be okay with remakes on old films its not every time the old ones are that good the filmmaking techniques has developed a lot and scenes can be made more realistic if they want today its always a question of money of course there has been so many movies that were made in the good old days but there were also money missing bad directors etc and they remakes them today fifty years later and suddenly they are okay to watch my friend got this box of old classic horrormovies and sf and i cannot say i was impressed of the so called good old days most of them you cold put in the trashcan directly they were so bad that we just sat there like zombiescould not movelike braindead i cannot recommend them to anyone some of them i have seen remakes of and i remember liking thembut not the originals they were just painful awful this is like the old story of who was the best bondmoore or conneryi think if you see roger moore first you maybe find him the one to trust or like thanks for me and i am sorry for my english that is not so good lars from sweden,1
i can just about understand why some people might wish to stress this films link with the eighties but i really would not say it is an accurate depiction of most peoples lives in that era  even on the poorest bradford estates it is however typical of the blunt agitprop rubbish the dear old royal court theatre was churning out at that time plenty of righton artistry for small small audiences but enough wellconnected backslapping to ensure future commissions for turgid playrights ithe simple fact is that if you want to reflect upon truer common experience you will find millions more nodding in knowing agreement to love and live as depicted in gregorys girl i would be tempted to call this a kitchen sink drama but that would be doing a great disservice to the plumbing industry however as far as having a decent script is concerned this film is indeed all washed up for some reason it has accrued an odd following amongst guardian reading filmgoers  i can only assume they get a visual frisson out of pretending to slum it steer clear my friends it is a poor film with a poor script that likes to think it is breaking boundaries by adding humorous insights into grim life on the estates it is notbut it is grim do the washing up instead,0
i first saw this video fifteen years ago i thought it was excellent then and i still do i am a former teacher of english high school and college and a lover of english romantic poetry so coleridge rates highly with me anything which might detract from the beauty of the poem or the power of the story would not get my vote of excellence in this case everything works well to engage the viewer especially high school students the story is well illustrated for a generation which grew up on television in addition the voice of michael redgrave adds a sense of authenticity and authority to it okay so there was not a big budget for the project so it was not star wars and there is no cgi in it but who can dismiss gustave doré illustrations as part of the presentation the comment above which in just four lines dismisses the video as a piece of trash is grossly unfair and unperceptive i am a friend of the producer but that is not my reason for this comment rather i am defending a work of artistry which i think has value on all levels it is well suited to bring coleridges poem to students in a way which awakens their appreciation of it and awakens their sympathy for the lesson which the ancient mariner imparts,1
what an extraordinary crime thriller my wife and i saw this at the toronto international film festival last week and it was far and away the best movie in an exceptionally strong festival it is already my second favourite film of alltime after dr strangelove and i was definitely on an emotional high as i walked home and discussed the film with my wifei do not want to spoil the plot because thrillers of this calibre are best enjoyed without preconceptions a synopsis that i would feel comfortable sharing is that two brothers played by phillip seymour hoffman and ethan hawke are planning to rob a jewellery store in westchester new york the film bounces back and forth in time over approximately a two week period of time before during and after the robbery and one key scene is repeated at least three times ordinarily that could disrupt the momentum of a film but that never happens during this masterpiece the excitement the tension and even the quality of the acting only seemed to get better as the film progressed by the end i was on the edge of my seat breathlessly waiting to see how it would all wrap up i know that i have used a few clichés in this post but i literally was on the edge of my seat i should mention that the nonlinear storyline is quite easy to follow this is not the sort of movie where you will overhear audience members asking their friend to explain the plot during the moviethe acting is absolutely brilliant allaround and i doubt i would have the same admiration for the film if the casting had not been so perfect a tiny complaint is that hoffman and hawke do not look like brothers but that is a minor quibble that i can easily overlook hoffman was at his very best and some of his scenes with hawke were positively electric marisa tomei as hoffmans wife and albert finney as the father of hoffman  hawke are also very good in supporting roles even some cameo performances were so impressive that i can still remember every remark gesture and facial expression by brian obyrne and michael shannon  absolute perfection the robbery scene felt more authentic than any other cinematic robbery scene i have ever watched and i had the same feeling of authenticity in most scenes especially the ones with hoffman the music helped to build up the tension throughout the movie often the same notes played over very effectively i had the music playing in my head the following day even as i sat through other films in addition to my minor complaint at the beginning of this paragraph there was one plot twist that felt a bit unbelievable major spoiler so i cannot describe the scene otherwise this film is pretty darn close to perfectthere were about a dozen great films at the festival that i would enjoy watching a second time but before the devil knows you are dead stands in a league of its own as an aside the director sidney lumet spoke before the film and he introduced marisa tomei and ethan hawke onto the stage tomei did not speak and she acted a bit shy so lumet asked can you believe that someone so beautiful could be so camerashy that comment is quite ironic considering the graphic opening scene,1
i hated the first episode of this show  protesting hippies  so much in one thousand nine hundred and ninetynine that i shunned the rest however when it came on the paramount comedy channel i watched it in full and to my surprise found it absolutely hilarious  motto never judge a comedy series in its first week  set in one thousand nine hundred and sixtynine hippies stars simon pegg as ray purbbs editor of an ozlike underground magazine called mouth his friends are the feminist jill laidback alex and the halfwit hugo back in the late sixtys there was a feeling of incredible optimism amongst the young that they could change the world through the printing of magazines nobody read rather than sneering at the hippies naivety hippies is affectionate towards it arthur mathews scripts cheekily parody a number of that eras icons  hair woodstock the graduate even the infamous oz obscenity trial of the early seventys excellent performances from the cast julian rhindtutts alex strangely put me in mind of the richard osullivan character from man about the house its a shame that there was never a second series possibly because of people like me if you missed hippies give it a try once you get past the dire opener you are in for a treat,1
in the midone thousand nine hundred and thirtys hollywood was regaining its confidence after the difficulties of the talkie transition although all the technical problems of sound had been solved very quickly it took longer to resolve the questions of how talking pictures should look how they should be structured and how they should be acted the informer is a key picture in that it shows the extent to which wordless moments can convey story asserting the power images without ignoring the necessities of sound and dialoguethis is not to say the informer is truly a throwback to the golden days of the silents for one thing many silent pictures were not so purely visual in their narrative and were overburdened with title cards but what the informer has is the selfassuredness to extend moments between dialogues to focus on reactions more than speeches and to let shots play out simply for atmospheredirector john ford for all his capability was a filmmaker who appears to have put in effort in proportion to how interested he was in the material if he thought a story was silly he just did it halfarsed luckily the informer with its depiction of community honour working class life and most importantly irish setting was everything ford loved and the result is one of his finest works in it ford only really employs too kinds of shot the first is of places  the dublin streets shrouded in mist and darkness so their furthest depths cannot be seen dingy interiors where the walls and ceilings seem to press in on us the second is of faces striking closeups against plain backgrounds usually without dialogue focusing us upon the inner conflicts of these peoplelead man victor mclaglen fits perfectly within this character and this manner of filming him mclaglens performance does not look like much being as it is about ninety drunk act but the other ten is heartfelt emoting as here and there his gypo nolan has what alcoholics refer to as a moment of clarity with such performances are oscars won mclaglen is backed by a spoton supporting cast among whom there are no weak links in particular it is nice to have donald meek and una oconnor usually only seen in comic relief roles playing straight dramatic parts for once although meeks appearance does contain one or two jokes the tone of the scene and much of his manner is serious not only do these two deliver incredibly deep performances their familiarity to most viewers as comedy players gives an added note of poignancy to their part in this tragedyrko who produced the informer were perhaps the most adventurous and willing to take risks of all the major studios thanks to this we are able to see a dismal story with a despicable antihero at its centre which could easily have been a clunky overearnest mess instead filled with a moody atmosphere and depth of character which keeps us watching and draws us into its world,1
can i give this a minus rating no well let me say that this is the most atrocious film i have ever tried to watch it was painful boringus maximus the plot is well hidden in several sublevels of nebulosity i rented this film with a friend and after about thirty minutes of hoping it would get better we decided to fast forward a little to see if things would get any better it never gets better this film about some dude getting kidnapped by these two girls sounds interesting but in reality it is just a bore nothing even remotely interesting ever happens if you ever get the chance to watch this do yourself a favor try plan nine from outer space instead,0

i saw this movie at the two thousand and six palm springs international film festival and it is a movie and not a film since it apparently was shot by hbo to be shown on their cable network sometime this year this movie presents page as a bondage and discipline fetish pinup and bd stag film actress who had enough talent to become a real actress page was a little more than that and the film touches on some of her other roles in modeling but not enough to balance out the career of the fiftys pinup icon this film is supposedly based on the book the real bettie page by richard foster it is shot in black and white for that one thousand nine hundred and fiftys nostalgia feel i have the book called bettie page the life of a pinup legend that has a lot of great photos chronicling the career of page and i must say that this movie reproduces on film with gretchen mol as page many of those famous photos very accurately mol herself with the bettie page black wig and brown contact lenses is bettie page not only does she have the bettie page look but she has the smile and characteristics of her personality that came through the camera down perfect and her body is as close to a replica of pages as possible terrific casting the story is kind of thin and tabloidesque and certainly could have been a lot better but this is a pretty good tv movie i would rate it a sevenzero of a scale of ten and recommend it is viewing when it comes on tv,1
three girls the youngest descendents of the gaylord family one of americas most royal families are orphaned at a young age right before he goes off to france to fight in wwi their father tells the oldest fiona never to sell the land by the time the sisters have become adults they have had to squander most of their money to pay for lawyers to defend their property through certain loopholes in the fathers will a man named charles barclay stands to gain possession of the gaylord land on which he wants to build a complex called barclay circle barclay is actually based on john d rockefeller who was buying up land and buildings from affluent families in new york so he could build rockefeller centerthis film deals mostly with the melodramatic concerns of the three sisters fiona well played by barbara stanwyck although it is certainly not to be counted as one of her best roles seems like a cold domineering woman and it becomes clear that she has some skeletons in her closet susanna played by nancy coleman is a little ditsy and completely in love with a young modern artist named gig young colemans was my favorite performance in the film evelyn played by geraldine fitzgerald is a rather pretentious seductress with a monocle who married into noble blood in england but that does not stop her from trying to steal gig from her sister the three sisters are developed quite well but as is the major trend in the gay sisters never well enough charles barclay is played by george brent he is not very good well he would be satisfactory if the story had played out the way it should have but he always seems like a scumbag in the film when we are asked to sympathize with him late in the film it is impossible gig young is played by huh gig young no he is not playing himself what happened is that the actor who had acted in several movies previously under his real name byron barr was pressured by warner brothers to change his name to something more catchy i am not sure who made the final choice but he eventually changed his screen name to gig young after the character whom he plays in the gay sisters weird eh young is quite good through most of the film but the script does some unfortunate things with his character late in the film which ultimately harm the audiences sympathy for him in two other supporting roles helen thimig and gene lockhart are quite goodthe gay sisters had great potential to turn out to be one of the great cinematic family sagas the characters are all interesting as are their situations unfortunately the script never strives for anything more than the simplest melodrama if it had made the interrelationships of all the major characters more complex fleshed out for example the rivalry between evelyn and susanna or made the flashback more intricate the film could have been fantastic it also could have fleshed out the prologue more let us know more about the gaylord family we need to care more about the characters and we need to sympathize with them more and the ending needed some major fixing it basically just gives up at the end fionas problems are solved so poorly that it hurts whatever sympathy her character had gained as the film progressed falls apart it is also far too happy this story seems moving towards tragedy or maybe just a sense of historical significance or loss and we still hate barclay and the conflict between the two sisters and gig is never solved as bad as fionas story ends susannas gigs and evelyns is even worsei still liked the film it is thoroughly watchable even if it does not involve us like other great films of the era seventen mostly for its potential it should have been remade or the novel should have been readapted at some point during the studio era it is too dated to be remade now the one thousand nine hundred and fiftys would have been the best time during the time of films like giant,1
this movie is maybe the most touching and uplifting one that i have ever seen i am not a religious person but sometimes a great piece of art like this movie can give me an almost religious experience one suddenly realizes that there is really meaning to lifei must admit that when i first heard about this movie i was sceptical i thought the plot sounded contrived and i was afraid that the story would be banal but being a david lynch fan i decided to give it a go it took me about thirty minutes to be fully captured by the movie but then i was completely lost in it there is so much wisdom and warmth in this movie i left the cinema feeling that i had truly learned something valuable about lifethis is not a typical david lynch movie and in some ways it was very surprising that he should make such a film after exploring the dark sides of human nature for so many years on the other hand i am not surprised that he manages to convey deep emotions and profound human insight because i also thought he managed that very well in the elephant man lynch is one of the most gifted directors around and i think the straight story is his best yet ninefiveten,1
this amusing bugs bunny cartoon sees the return of the still unnamed marvin the martian and his sidekick knine the green dogthis time instead of trying to destroy the earth marvin is on a mission to land capture an earth creature and take it back to mars of course the creature he picks is bugs bunny at first bugs thinks marvin and knine are trick or treating but realises this cannot be right when marvin drastically enlarges bugs rabbit hole with a raygun bugs tries to trick his way out of the situation in a couple of ways including persuading marvin that knine is planning a mutiny eventually he is captured using an acme straitjacket ejecting bazooka amazingly for an acme product it works as advertised and bugs is forced to use his wits to get knine to release him the tables are soon turned and the two disgruntled martians are trussed up and bugs is trying to fly their saucer back to earthi really enjoyed this although the ending is a little weak compared to the rest of the story marvins voice has changed slightly here and he gets visible emotional when he is angry but this did not make me like him or the cartoon any less,1
sometimes a premise starts out good but because of the demands of having to go overboard to meet the demands of an audience suffering from attentiondeficit disorder it devolves into an incongruous mess and for three wellrespected actors who have made better work before and after this is a mortal shameso let us see premise a loving couple who lives in a beautiful home is threatened by a bad cop interesting to say the least make the encroaching cop a little disturbing why not it was well done in the hand who rocks the cradle and single white female and it is a proved ticket to a successful thrillernow herein lies the dilemma create a disturbing story that actually bothers to bring some true menace into its main characters while never going so far as to look ridiculous or throw any semblance to reality amp up the shock factor and make this cop so extreme  an ultra bad variation of every other supervillain that is hit cinemas since the silent agethe producers and directors chose the latter thus is the resulting film  badly made with actors trying their darnedest to make heads or tails in roles that they have essayed before and nothing much amounting to even less,0
my alltime favorite movie oscarcaliber work by everyone involved both in front of and behind the camera the screenplay is perfect and works out the relationship between lady caroline and george briggs in a completely satisfying way unlike the novel the care with which the other leading characters have been drawn is a tribute to screen writer peter barnes and the intense visual beauty should have won oscars for director mike newell and cinematographer rex maidment it is josie lawrences best work by far and transformed my opinion of joan plowright having watched this movie at least fifty times i can find no fault in it the music by famed composer richard rodney bennet is a marvel,1
this would have been a great silent film the acting really is good at least in a look ma i am doing really big acting sort of wayeverything is huge every line is profound every scene is shattered by human tragedymostly i felt like gagging yet like any train wreck i could not tear my eyes away this dialogue might have worked on the stage although i doubt it on the screen it was cluttered haphazard hackneyed and pretty much every other stereotypical negative adjective you can come up with to describe a really bad dramatic workif you enjoy your melodrama in huge heaping doses you might enjoy the movie be prepared to wait however for all that melodrama this thing sure plods along at its own pacethis script must have sounded a lot different when the actors involved were reading it to themselves it simply does not work once they get around to delivering it in front of the cameraimdb does us a great disservice at times when it uses its goofy computercontrolled weighted score curse of the starving class deserves less than a onecharacterdriven fiction is great but when you develop your characters by simply pushing them through hoops with no plausible explanation for their maturation or evolution it is not character development your characters must have a motivation being drunk for a while and waking up in a field is not character development that is a plot contrivancestay away from this movie or at the very least watch it muted perhaps you will get some amusement from all the armwaving the characters dooh and word to the wise  to prove that this is truly an artsy film you see james woods in all his dangly male lookatme i amthefigurativeandliteralrepresentationofthenakedvulnerabilityof man glorydo not say you were not warned,0

this must have been one of the worst movies i have ever seeni have to disagree with another commenter who said the special effects were okay i found them pretty bad it just was not realistic and they were so fake that it just distracted from the actual storymaybe that distraction is the reason that i did not fully understand the story the archaeologists are looking for the set they do not bother to tell what set or what is so special about it that also makes it unclear why they search for it in california while the intro of the movie takes place in ancient egyptif you are shooting a movie that takes place in the desert take the effort to actually go to the desert the beginning  the ancient ceremony  looks like it was shot inside a studio instead of a desertthe actionlevel was constant throughout the movie no ups and downs no climax it made the movie look short and that is certainly a pro for this particular movie,0
this film speaks a universal language one can relate it to the self community society or the wider world it has a way of not only opening up several questions but also setting one in pursuit of discovering and asking the right questions in order to get to that point of self conviction  ownership the portrayal of the stereotypes within the film addresses the archetypes around us which must be recognised as being the repeating cycle of destruction the opposing force of innovation creativity and growth the factors which disturb the natural flow of things must be made apparent and tackled the idea is definitely a film to be experienced and not just viewed as it taps into ones internal voice  conscience through the looking it makes one feel as opposed to just watch,1
cult classics are nearly impossible to predict who could guess that vision quest fight club and two thousand and one a space oddysey movies that were panned by critics and audiences alike upon their release would become immensely popular like many imdbers i consider myself a movie expert unlike the majority of those who hated envyevidenced by a dismal fourfour rating i found envy to be one of the funniest movies in the last decadethe plot of the movie is ridiculous the dialogue is not clever the scenes have little continuity and the script seems like it was written by a fourth grader but that is exactly why the movie is so hilarious you see in order to appreciate the accidental genius of envy you have to enjoy the movie from an ironicallydetached point of viewwhy do i love envy because the movie is bad to the point that it becomes good this is the recipe for a cult classic and envy definitely fits the bill,1
metrogoldwynmayer is a very lost player in the short cartoon market this market is essentially dominated by the looney tunes and the merry melodies shorts coming from warner bros but mgm is also able of releasing hidden gems like to spring an astonishing story about the most beautiful season of the yearin the environment depicted here spring is not caused by natural cycles but is fabricated and by who by little male elves who live below ground each spring when the snow begins to melt they start working they begin by felling rainbow rock columns then reducing them to rubble and using this rubble to turn it into color fluids which will be moved up to the ground and bearing grass flowers in other words spring the first half of the cartoon depicts springs fabrication but the second part is a little bit different old man winter comes back and he tries to extend winter by destroying the elves work so from this point we assist to a battle between the elves and old man winterthe music heard here is deliciously wonderful the melodic parts stick in the head like an ink spot on a paper sheet the second part melodies are thrilling and they perfectly fit with the action this is just fantastico giorgio the animation sequences are also a delight the colors are well mixed and every little detail is shown into a massive epic environment the concept itself is brilliant the elves are attracting characters so is old man winter who effectively portrays the cold and ruthless feelings of the white seasonthere is also a strong message included here the battle seems lost for the elves at the end until a single late arriving elf jump into the action and it leads to the elves victory over winter so the point is only one single person can make the differencein conclusion to spring is a remarkable lost classic from short cartoon era what is even more remarkable is that this cartoons director made his debut here and who is to springs director it is a certain william hanna,1
spoilers spoilers well seeing as i am a major hlots fan maybe i liked the movie more than normal people would however this movie is still excellent it had tons of surprises and it gave some more closure to the series while i was sad that bayliss turned into a murderer the overall feeling i felt was satisfied,1
interesting way of looking at how we as humans so often behave we are sometimes blinded by our desire to achieve perfection that we some times destroy the foundation of what we are trying to achieve it also addresses the issue how we tend to ignore those among us who are not as outspoken and by doing this may miss out on a great opportunity the injection of comedy also makes watching the film an enjoyable experiencea must see for anyone who is interested in a reflective yet comical look at life i am eagerly looking forward to your next producthope that you will continue to provide us with quality entertainment excellent work joanne,1

i was going to say this was the worst gaythemed film i have ever seen but i can honestly say this is the worst film if any genre i have ever seenyou know you are in trouble when a movie starts with a personal note from the director asking for the audiences understanding for the many challenges facing a firsttime director the audio track is so bad in many scenes it is almost impossible to follow the dialogue and this from a dvd version bad lighting bad sets bad photography poor script generally bad acting all add up to make this film unwatchable i did make it through to the bad ending after several attempts and immediately gave away the dvd i foolishly purchased i am sure there are many challenges facing a firsttime director but do not try to palm off this lame attempt as a finished product i see from imdb details that this was not only the first directing attempt of richard natale but also the only that is the one positive thing i can say about this alleged movie,0
what can you say about the film white fire amazing fantastic disturbing hilarious these words are not big enough to describe the event which is white fire from wobbly garbled beginning to profound end this movie will entertain throughoutour movie begins in the woods of a country somewhere in the world a family is hiding from unmarked soldiers in costume shop uniforms when the father separates from the mother and their childen you get a real sense of what kind of movie you are about to watch father makes sure to roll down hills in his all white outfit and is polite as he gets peoples attention before he shoots them but alas dad is burned alive in what looks like a very unsupervised unsafe stunt meanwhile mom and the kids are running down a beach with an armed soldier trailing about five feet behind them he too gives a stern warning before action in the form of a bizarre halt and then promptly wastes the mother this action sequence sets up the happy childhood of our heroes bo and ingredso now we fast forward about twenty years thirty if you are honest about the heros age to beautiful turkey where bo and ingred have settled as professional thieves or diamond prospectors or something ingred works at a diamond mine where she helps herself to the goods while bo masterfully played by the dynamic robert ginty drives around the desert in his denim outfits bo and ingrid have an interesting relationship they do not seem to have any friends other than each other and they spend all of their time together that coupled with the fact that bo has expressed his desire to sleep with his sister as evidenced in lines such as you know its a shame you are my sister he says to her while she is stark naked make for a very dynamic duo bo is then crushed when ingrid is killed as he wanders the beaches of turkey with his ceremonial pink grief scarf a renewal of hope occurs when bo finds a girl who looks like ingrid and gives her plastic surgery to make her look exactly like ingrid this opens the door for bo to have sex with his sister without it being technically wrong bo is a real fan of ethical grey areas and he is overjoyed with his new loveso anyway there is a lot of fun action scenes ridiculous violence great acting impossible to follow plotlines fred the hammer williamson for some reason and a big chunk of dirty ice which is supposed to be a giant diamond which later explodes all of these things are great but the bo and ingrid relationship is what makes this movie specialreally special so i heartily encourage everyone to behold the majesty that is white fire you may be glad you didor not,1
what a thrill ride twisted and thought provoking once again sharon stone pulls off her drop dead gorgeous spellbinding character of author catherine tramell impeccably the original basic instinct takes place in san francisco the sequel takes place in london where catherine has now relocated both bustling cities known for excitement haute couture  and a perfect place for someone like catherine trammel to take residency david morrisey derailed plays the smooth role of psychiatrist dr michael glass the character david thewlis plays as roy washburn with scotland yard is a refreshing departure from his role as lupin in the harry potter series flashy cars designer clothes sex drama humortension  all of the basic instincts mind bending throughout great screenplay from the climactic opening scene to the surprise ending this film is anything but boring everyone in the theater was glued to the screen,1
i was treated to a viewing of cracker bag last night before a preview screening of disneys holes i do not know who decided to show it but i am so very glad they did cracker bag is an absolute gem a snapshot of australia in the early eightys as seen through a childs eye the conversations between eddie and her brother were hilarious and as with the rest of the film so true to life each shot brought a great sense of nostalgia as it reminded me of my own childhood being the same age as the director probably helps a little and the audio multiplied the feeling i only hope i get to see cracker bag again some day,1
check out the films website more time was put into making that than in the writing of the script for this movie it could not be more off in it is boasting original story original they must have found the script tucked away between the old testament or face legal repercussion for that bit of horntooting highend special effects come on i could do better with an atari seven thousand six hundred and a jug of earwax stylish cinematography oh yes the americas funniest home video look is still a classic i am sure they had little money available for this title so of course the sf are not really that good or a bit bad now and then or just plain hilarious but it is the story that makes this film a waste of time and money four stories rolled into one and all of them brainless bits of seenbefores and donealreadys,0
rather then long dance sequences and close ups of the characters which made the film drag on  the movie would have been better served explaining the story and motivations of the charactersthe marginalisation of nubo the minister auntie mother  and the dumbing down of the dynamic and important rivalry between hatsumo and mameha and hatsumo and sayuri made the movie lack any real depth if you had not read the book you would not really understand why sayuri loved the chairman and why mameha became her mentor at allvisually the film was stunning  and the actors all did the best with the c rate script they were given but that was all that was good about this movie,0
this movie was awesome not quite as good as the leif garrett masterpiece longshot but still awesome i thought ashley looked freakin huge compared to marykate in this film i wonder why who would have thought they could swith places like that and almost get away with it dad was kind of a jerk though and mom was a little too chummy with helmit head i give it four any one who likes this movie shoudl check out longshot,0
this one grew on me i love the rd burman music and in spite of the cruder elements of the story i found much to be moved by as i kept rewatching the movie the brothersister plot line is powerful i thought there is also more probably obligatory stuff like bar fights a loony crime story etc that are just distracting though not unfunny from a certain point of view also the english translation is definitely by someone for whom it was a bit of a stretch and as loony as it is i am grateful to him for doing itlike many of the bollywood movies i have seen this one is melodramatic and operalike including here notably a song sung first by a little boy to cheer up his abused and unhappy sister and then the same song sung twelve or so years later by the man who has travelled to kathmandu seeking to reconnect with this girl grown up and troubled she had been told her brother and mother were dead numbing her pain with drugsa super thing about this one thousand nine hundred and seventyone movie is that it is about the hippie movement which brought hordes of seekers to india from an indian point of view that sees them as people driven to india by a spiritual hunger aroused by the failings of their own societies but nonetheless in india living only for the pleasures of the moment the hippie singingdancingdrugging scenes are truly wonderful and accurate in their tone i am old enough to remember and i feel pretty sure that the masses of young white zonedout kids are actual hippie extras as i remember hearing about kids on the caravan to the east getting this kind of work in bollywoodit is not about the actual hare krishna movement though the movie hippies sing a krishnarama chant as do a group of actual indian devotees unrelated to the hippies in the opening scene of the movievirginia,1
in modern day eastern europe life is hard and for young women prostitution is one of the only career options and one taken reluctantly by melania she attracts the attentions of an american seymour who becomes obsessed with her paying more and more money for time with her until he eventually wants to buy her outright she has two pimps with differring emotional attachments to her and she is generally passed around like some piece of baggage with no feelings of her own however we are in modern arthouse cinema territory so conventions like narrative structure lighting the subject so it can be seen camera techniques that add to rather than distract from the action and a vaguely consistent plot can all be abandoned much of the time i had no idea what was supposed to be happening and very rarely did i care people began leaving the screening almost before the last latecomers had arrived and i do not think i have ever seen so many people walk outimages are important to the director  characters slowly emerge from or disappear into a dark screen we get long lingering shots of nothing in particular and one sex scene takes place in infrared in fact for such an unconventional film the sex scenes were remarkably ordinary missionary positions between naked people in bed abounded and there were no drugs or related weirdness but perhaps these days being ordinary is unconventionalon the whole almost entirely without merit,0
when you pick a movie i hope one factor you will consider are the actors in the movie using their fame to influence the moral fabric of our society in a positive or negative way this is not a political statement this is a moral issue that effects are society when a comedianactor makes curl sexual and racist remarks about a teenager and her father we should ask ourselves do i want to support that behavior in this case mr foxx behavior tears at the social fabric that teaches our youth right from wrong good behavior from bad that lovingkindness is better than hatefulness mr foxx should remember he is only entertainment and there is a lot of that out there for us to choose from saying sorry does not get him off the hook it will not undue the hurt or remove the bad behavior he spreads to our youth one way to stop this behavior is to stop being a fan of it no longer see anything they are part of we cannot change them but we can stop the fame we give them,0
nacho vigalondo is very famous in spain he is a kind of bad showman who can make you feel sick very embarrassing nacho had made some commercials in tv i remember one in which nacho was looking for paul mc carney around madrid the commercial was about a mc carney cd collection this little movie is like a nachos commercial bad storyline bad directing and awful performances i cannot believe that a disgusting movie like this was in the kodak theater poor oscarnacho could made this movie because of his wife the producer of this seventhirtyfive a woman very well connected with spanish tv business men,0
i did not know what to expect from the film well now i know this was a truly awful film the screenplay directing and acting were equally bad the story was silly and stupid the director could have made a smart and thought provoking film but he did not i squirmed in my seat for the last half of the movie because it was so bad where was the focus to the film where was anything in this film christians should boycott this film instead of promoting it it was shabbily done and a waste of my money do not see this film,0
shame really  very rarely do i watch a film and am left feeling disappointed at the end i have seen quite a few of ira levins adaptations  rosemarys baby and the stepford wives  and liked both them but this just did not appeal to mewhen i read the plot outline  an award winning playwright michael caine decides to murder one of his former pupils christopher reeve and steel his script for his own success  i was excited i like thrillers michael caines a good actor sidney lumets a good director and ira levins work is generally goodi will not spoil it for anyone who has not seen it yet but all i would say is there are loads of twists and turns so many its kind of hard to explain the films plot line in detail without giving it away i enjoyed the first  fortyfive minutes before the twists and turns began to occur and at that point my interest and enjoyment began to fade out though i have to give lumet credit for the very amusing ending which did make me laugh out loudthe main cast  michael caine christopher reeve dyan cannon and irene worth  were all brilliant in their roles though worths obvious fake russian accent got on my nerves slightly nothing personal irene i think any actors fake accent would irritate me not sure if cannons character was meant to be annoyingly funny but dyan managed to annoy and amuse  at the same timeanyone reading this  i do not want you to be putoff watching this because of my views  give it a chance you may like it you may not it is all about opinion,0
der todesking is not one of my favorite jorg buttgereit film  but still is an interesting film dealing with suicide and it is reasons and ramifications those looking for a gorefest or exploitation in the style of the nekromantik films or schramm will probably be disappointed der todesking is definitely an arthouse style film so those that need linear explainable narratives need not applythe basic concept of der todesking is that there is an episode for each day of the week that revolves around a strange chain letter that apparently causes people to commit suicide interspersed with scenes of a slowly decomposing corpsethere are some very well done and thought provoking scenes including the man talking about the problems with his wife and the concert massacre which unfortunately lost some of it is power on me because i was too busy laughing at the scorpions lookalike band on stage but seriously  this is a sometimes beautiful the scene that shows different angles of that huge bridge is particularly effective  especially if you understand the significance of the scene and that the names shown are of people that actually committed suicide from jumping from the bridge sometimes confusing sometimes silly the she wolf of the ss ripoff is pretty amusing sometimes harrowing i found the scene of the guy talking to the girl in the park about his wife particularly effective film that is more of an experience then just entertainment as many of these art films are meant to be still i did not find der todesking to be as strong as nekromantik or schramm and would probably put it on relatively even footing with nekromantik two in terms of my personally enjoyment level definitely worth a look to any buttgereit or art film fan if you dig this type of film  check out subconscious cruelty  in my opinion the best arthousehorror film that i have seen seventen for der todesking,1
the movie is plain bad simply awful the string of bad movies from bollywood has no end they must be running out of excuses for making such awful movies or notthe problem seems to be with mainly the directors this movie has two good actors who have proved in the past that the have the ability to deliver great performancebut they were directed so poorly the poor script did not help eitherthis movie has plenty of ridiculous moments and very bad editing in the first half for instance after his onest big concert ajay devgan meets up with om puri from whom he ran away some thirty years ago and talked to again and all om puri finds to say is to beware of his friendship with salman what a load of crap seriously not to mention the baaad soundtrack whatever happened to shankar ehsaan loyajay devgun is total miscast for portraying a rockstaronly saving grace are the good performances in the second half ajay shines as his character shows his dark side so does salman as the drug addict watch it maybe only for the last half hour,0
the most succinct way to describe ride with the devil is with but one word authenticity i will not rehash what has already been said about this wonderous film but i would like to say how much the historical research and painstaking attention to detail the crew no doubt went through was appreciated by this filmgoeras a student of history familiar with the period and setting of this film i must say that this production is one of the most accurate fictional films regarding bleeding kansas yes there were liberties taken on the actual events as all fiction is apt to do but the overall feel of the film is genuine authentic costumes authentic attitudes no pc hindsight here even the actors look authenticeven jewel kilcher who has a small part in the film looked like she stepped form a mid nineteenth century photographa few viewers i talked with have expressed their incredulity at the stylized dialog they cannot believe that nineteenth century farmers would talk like poetswhat they do not realize is that in this age of verbal slobbishness the american public public of the nineteenth century was a surprisingly literate and eloquent bunch these people were raised on shakespeare and the king james version of the bible the screenwriters reconstructed the most likely verbal styles of these people judging from documentation of the time the stylized dialog just adds to the magical atmosphere of the filmbut in addition to a historical document this film works on a visceral level as well beautifully photographed and performed it harkens back to the days of the great western epics the raid on lawrence kansas done so many times before in so many other lesser films is portrayed with a sense of urgency that puts the viewer right in the midst of the actionromance adventure moral and ethical conflictthis film has everything a discerning moviegoer could want in a year that was dominated by overhyped garbage like american beauty this great artwork was buried by an indifferent studio system but i am certain that ride with the devil will be given it is due in the coming years please rent this film you will not be disappointed,1
i could not give this film a bad rating or bad review for two reasons robin williams and toni collete the film has the potential of being a thriller and there are some slight disturbing elements that lean to the psychological which was something the film could have focused a little on robin williams plays gabriel noon a storytelling night time deejay who is going through personal issues his lover moves out and gabriel is having what seems to be a case of storytellers block one day he receives and reads a story written by a dying fourteenyear old boy named pete boland rory culkin pete tells the story of his life and the abuse he suffered at the hands of his parents he lives with his adopted mother and social worker donna boland toni collette gabriel is fascinated and begins a friendship with pete but things seem strange when gabriel attempts to meet him and discovers the possibility that pete boland may not even exist i will not go into detail because i do not want to spoil the film but i will tell you this it is quite predictable fascinating atmosphere for telling a story and good performances from robin williams and toni collette who i thought was the films key character collette is without question one of the most talented and loveliest actresses her ability to tap into the psyche and personality of the characters she portrays is very uncanny and i hope to see her win an oscar hell i think she might pull off getting a best supporting actress nod for this one if the script were a little better the film starts off as a psychological thriller but a predictable one at that if your curious to know the films ending and twists then see the film otherwise i would rent another predictable thriller called hide and seek,0
hitler the rise of evil is clearly produced by people emotionally unburdened by the horrors of world war two which makes watching a refreshing experiencei think its greatest value lies in its crystal clear revealing of the nazimechanism of the utterly corrupt ways hitler used to make it to the top having arrived there this film endswhen on top the fuhrer  german for leader led his germany to the biggest  most devastating war in history of mankind ending six years later in germanys utter defeat as a result germany lost its eastern provinces  about thirtyfive of its prewar soil and was forced to accept a fortyfour yearsplit of its remaining territory both west and east germany had to be rebuilt from scrap their reputations severely damaged by the many naziatrocities inspired by racismas i said hitler the rise of evil makes an good watch set in an acceptable thirtiesenvironment with more than competent acting in particular peter otooles role as the aged president von hindenburg stands out even adds an extra dimensionmy copy of hitler the rise of evil also provides a second dvd with two good documentary films one is about hitlers personality the second deals with the forgery of the hitlerdiaries in one thousand nine hundred and eightythree this forgery caused a hilarious scandal in england and germany damaging the reputations of several historians and journalists,1
this film deals with the atrocity in derry thirty years ago which is commonly known as bloody sundaythe film is well researched acted and directed it is as close to the truth as we will get until the outcome of the saville enquiry the film puts the atrocity into context of the time it also shows the savagery of the soldiers on the day of the atrocity the disgraceful whitewash that was the widgery tribunal is also dealt withoverall this is an excellent drama which is moving and shocking when the saville report comes out watch this film again to see how close to the truth it is,1

the thing i remember most about this film is that it used to air on local ktla tv ch five during every christmas season during the mid to late seventys mainly due to the fact that the true story took place on or near christmas eve it was always a bit disturbing to see the hell that this girl goes through being the lone survivor of a plane crash in the peruvian jungle the graphic scene of this young girl pulling leeches out of her infected leg made quite an impression on this young viewer not quite the kind of christmas cheer i was used to seeing at the time definitely not a rankinbass production,1
i rented this on dvd and i kind of feel bad since dawson and lugacy are so earnest about it in the dvd comments it is not a bad movie exactly but it is one of those films that desperately wants to be a deep comment on human nature while not realizing that its story is practically a genre plus it is a little simplistic about the issue in a lot of ways and the characters behavior often strains belief i would say its a film that you would get something out of if you do not have a lot of filmtvliteraturelife behind you to be honest i have seen almost exactly the same story in horror comics even otherwise its point has been made before and more artfully and that gets to the big problem which is that it really does not have much of cinematic interest to it besides the point it ends up being a fairly bland movie overall that invests everything in the idea that the basic story will be shocking and compelling and it does not really pay off,0
culled from the real life exploits of chuck connors and steve brodie in one thousand eight hundred and ninetys new york the bowery is high energy and good naturedbut be warned casual racial epithets flow off the tongues of wallace beery and little jackie cooper the very first shot might be startling this is true to the time it was set and the time it was made and it also speaks to the diversity of population in that neck of the woods it certainly adds to the gritty flavor of the atmospherebeery as connors is the blustering thunder at the center of the action a loudmouth saloon keeper with his own fire brigade and he has a soft spot for ornery orphan cooper raft as brodie is connors slicker better looking rival in almost every endeavor brodie could never turn down a dare and loved attention leading up to a jump off the brooklyn bridge it is still debated whether he actually jumped or used a dummybeery is as bombastic as ever with a puton irishamerican accent he is just the gruff sort of character to draw children cats and ladies in distress this is possibly the most boisterous character raft ever played and he even gets to throw in a little dancing as well as a show of leg and again he mistakes the leading lady lovely fay wray for a prostitute cooper is as tough as either of them though he gets a chance to turn on the tearsthe highlight is not the jump off the bridge but a noholdsbarred fistfight between connors and brodie that in closeup looks like a real brawl between the principals it is sure someone bruised more than an ego,1
when i was younger i really enjoyed watching bad television we have all been guilty of it at some time or another but my excuse for watching things like buck rogers in the twentyfiveth century and silver spoons is this i was young and naive ignorant of what makes a show really worthwhilethankfully i now appreciate the good stuff stargate sgone is not good the twelve yearold me would love every hackneyed bit of it every line of stilted dialogue every bit of needless technobabble the writing is beyond insipid so bland and uninspired it makes one miss star trek voyager if your show makes me long for the worst trek show ever you are in troublethe film stargate is a wonderful guilty pleasure anchored by two solid performances by james spader and kurt russell full of fascinating egyptian architecture and culture a wonderful musical score and cool scifi ideas with the exception of a little of the original music none of what made the film fun appears in this show even richard dean anderson who made macgyver watchable and legend interesting seems like he is half asleep most episodesthe budget must have been very low because the sets sometimes look like somebody is basement the cinematography is not much better as vanilla and dull as the scripts it amazes me that shows with a lot more style like farscape and substance like the reimagined battlestar galactica have smaller less rabid fanbases than this pap it just does not deserve it,0
this movie was horrible i could barely stay awake through it i would never see this movie again if i were payed to the socalled horror scenes in it were increadably predictable and over played there was really nothing about this movie that would have made it original or worth the sevenfifty i payed to see it do not go see it do not rent it do not read about it online because any of these things would be a complete waste of your time sarah michelle geller gave a lackluster performance and really should be ashamed of herself for sullying her good name with this movie shame on you sarah for being associated with this horrible horrible movie horrible movie no need to ever see it,0
i quote oedpius rex because it is a tragedy that this film was even madethis is one of the worst movies i have ever seen i am in no way an uwe boll hater like most of the humourless people on imdb uwe boll movies like postal and tunnel rats are hilariously bad and therefore entertaining but honestly this movie was just horrible i hated it so much that i would give it a zero star rating if i could the story is just crap it spends four fifths of the film building the plot and then they have the middle which is just scenes of grizzly horrible tastelessly done murder the finally end it with a villan wins ending which is totally acceptable but surely it could have been more tasteful than this i am not against uwe boll like i said earlier nor am i against violent movies i fking love violent movies i loved the saw movies the hostel movies tokyo gore police the new york ripper the twentyeight movies dog soldiers my bloody valentine last house on the left watchmen wolf creek every tarantino movie every sam peckinpah even cannibal fking holocaust but this omfg this was just cruel sadistic and perverted and look at the movies i just listed if i liked cannibal holocaust and not this then it must be bad uwe do not go all dark again you are funny when you are light hearted just like ed wood this was just an awful experience i felt horrible all over after seeing thisdo not watch avoid at all cost,0
just got my copy of this dvd two disc set and while not perfect i found the overall experience to be a fun way to waste some time i have to say right up front that i am a huge fan of zombie movies and i truly think that the fine people who made these films must be too i also have a soft spot for people who are trying sometimes against all odds to live a dream and again these people are doing it is this some awardwinning collection of amazing film no not even close but for what they do on their meager budgets these films should be recommended for me the bottom line is always was i entertained did i have a good time with this movie and here the answer to both was yes the first in the series is also the most raw it opens with some kind of accident at a nuclear facility and people melt down or something cut to some years later and a new housing community is built over the old reactor site some kids making a video fall into a hole and find themselves trapped in the bottom levels of the facility they get rescued but the hole is not sealed and the people from the opening start lumbering out of the hole soon the whole town is overtaken by the undead and these zombies are fun they go from cool rot makeup to the cheapest slap on whiteface ever but they are fun the whole movie culminates in a showdown between the final survivors of the area and the undead with our heroes going into the reactors lower levels to take out the flesh eating zombies and seal the hole forever pretty cheesy but i think it was meant to be still it moves very fast has buckets of gruesome effects and really tries to have some style the acting is uneven but a few good performances shine through and one really should listen to the commentary track i went back and watched it again with that on and found it to be a good bit of information on the trials and fun that the crew and cast experienced on the movie director todd sheets seems pretty proud of this his first film but also has no delusions he knows it is a trashy zombie movie but he does show respect to people involved also sheets has a great sense of humor and some humble integrity that others could learn from in the movie field the behind the scenes of zombie bloodbath is pretty fun as well i felt it was almost as entertaining as the film it was made for there are some great interviews and behind the scenes footage mixed with news stories about the film from some major places like cnn fox and mtv over all a fun little film that is very rough around the edges but still had me laughing and enjoying the ride i have seen many dv films and some shot of video films and many are quite dull but this one really was not while newer dv films are technically superior they just are not fun overall this is a solid if a bit flawed release with plenty of extras and tons of gore and splatter while not breaking any grand rules of move making i found the series to be fun and always a laugh so i give this set a solid recommendation todd sheets was not trying to make award winning art here folks he was trying sometimes against all odds it seems to make fun zero budget splattery horror and to that end he has succeeded in spades,1
the surprise nominee of this years best animated feature race at the oscars it is an irish film by heart but it was coproduced by belgium and brazil with i am guessing animators working in all three countries the product is one of the most beautiful and unique films in recent memory the character design is a little reminiscent of the french animated film persepolis from a couple of years back with very simple characters with thick black outlines this film is not in black and white oh no what makes this film great is its use of color simply some of the most outrageous and startling use of colors i have ever seen the general design of the pictures is also a lot more geometrical with characters who are basically rectangles or ovals much of the film can be spent playing find the circle  a major aspect of the visual design is a circle in the center of the image all of these geometrical designs have a purpose  the story is about a young boy who is learning to be an artist working on illuminated manuscripts the book of kells is a real illuminated bible the art of the film is based on the drawings in it the story of the film is not especially deep but it is a pretty good fantasy tale brendan is a young boy in kells a city surrounded by enormous walls built by his uncle to keep out vikings a newcomer to kells brother aiden inspires brendan to take up illustrating he also inspires him to do things like leave kells and explore the nearby forest within which lives a nymph bruno coulais provides a fantastic score almost as good as the one he did for coraline which i consider the very best of the year,1
just about everything in this movie is wrong wrong wrong take mike myers for example he is reached the point where you realize that his shtick has not changed since his snl days over ten years ago he is doing the same cutesy streamofconsciousness jokes and the same voices his cat is painfully unfunny he tries way to hard he is some weird type a comedian not the cool cat he is supposed to be the rest of the movie is just as bad the sets are unbelievably ugly  and clearly a waste of millions of dollars cardboard cutouts for the background buildings would have made more sense than constructing an entire neighborhood and main street alec balwin tries to do a funny great santini impression but he ends up looking and sounding incoherent there is even an innapropriate cheesecake moment with faux celebrity paris hilton  that sticks in the mind simply because this is supposed to be a dr seuss story avoid this movie at all costs folks it is not even an interesting train wreck i hope they will make horton hears a who with robin williams then we will have the badseuss moviestarringspasitc comedian trilogy,0
i saw this movie a few months ago on cable and it was fantastic william h macy is one of my favorite actors and his performance was just amazing he makes you care for his character even when he is clearly doing the wrong thing and neve campbell gives a performance that is with out a doubt the best performance i have seen by an actress this year she is fantastic as a wild young woman who is wise beyond her yearsdonald sutherland is just plain creepy as macys father and john ritter is fine as a shrink stuck in the middle of everything that is happeningi wish that this was in the theater because i feel that it is a movie that should be view by a wider audience that is a shame because it is a hell of allot better that most of the new movies coming into the theater now,1
henry hathaway was daring as well as enthusiastic for his love of the people of the early days in us history however to critique historical inaccuracies of his film about brigham young and the mormon people are not necessary or useful in commenting for this film in my opinion hathaway did superb direction that conveys what a mormon people were in the early history of the church of jesus christ of latterday saints during the time period beginning with the martyrdom of joseph smith to the date of film release in often subtle filming and dialog delivery he covered mormon philosophies and teachings in many of the segments and scenesi remember watching this movie on many saturday mornings during my youth in the early one thousand nine hundred and fiftys that was just over ten years after the films release and before the los angeles temple was completed which i watched being constructed and instilled more curious wonder of who mormons were i recently purchased this film and will enjoy the following messages that hathaway interpreted in his filmone love for all people regardless of their personal beliefs two charity to those in need or not three family is high in importance four listen respectfully and carefully because even opposing messages have important points to consider and adopt five work hard both individually and in community six prepare and store for future days of need seven hope is a binding link to a higher being and for our daily lives eight and that there is a unique quality to any group and appreciate those that are identified as beneficial,1
never realized that charles boyer luis denard appeared with lauren bacallrose cullen in a film together and enjoyed their great acting together even peter lorre contreras had a role in this film and had a bad misfortune in his bathroom that caused him to faint this story deals with a republican courier luis denard who visits england during the spanish civil war and tries to disrupt a coal mining contract that will cause great harm to other nations lauren bacall rose cullen comes to the aid of luis denard by picking him up and at the same time falling in love with him and then proceeds to help him escape from an angry crowd of english mine workers who threaten his life the real bad guy in this film is victor francen licata beast with five fingers who gives an outstanding performance great classic one thousand nine hundred and fortyfive film without humphrey bogart,1
here is yet another blasphemous european story in which they blast the religion of their country these atheist filmmakers are relentless here we see a brutal blasting of catholics andor the catholic clergy and i am not catholicthis won actually won an academy award for bes foreign film that is probably because the story made catholics and religious belief in general look extremely weak one of the main characters is a priest and he cares more about food than anything else he is portrayed as nothing but an idiot no wonder the secular dominated academy loved this moviealso there is some overacting fool who plays a guy who renounces his religion so he can marry one of the four daughters featured in the story the daughters take turns seducing the seminary student who states he studied for six years but says he is an agnostic i mean how blasphemous is this filmthis is a disgrace and another excellent example of the secularprogressive bigotry of the film business worldwide not just hollywood,0
this is one of the most interesting movies i have ever seen i love the backwoods feel of this movie the movie is very realistic and believable this seems to take place in another era maybe the late sixtys or early seventys henry thomas works well with the young baby very moving story and worth a look,1
i remember watching american gothic when it first aired it came into my mind recently all i could remember was the same guy appeared in midnight caller which is gary cole i do not watch much tv but i watched american gothic i purchased the complete series on dvd this week it is still as good as ever this is one of the best tv series ever the reason i do not watch much tv is because it is just rubbish that is on except for derren brown it is all reality tv or soaps such as grease big brother etc i am fed up with it i got the complete series of american gothic for £sixteenninetyseven form the asda website that is the cheapest i can find it,1
ten out of ten this brilliant super documentary is a must see with film clips from the war which people did not seen for years untill this was screened in one thousand nine hundred and seventyfour the film clips in this documentary from the war does not miss out anything some of the clips left me dumbstuck the whole series is over twenty episodes long and sir lawrence olivier is the narrator and tells a stunning story of war simply this is still probably the best documentary of war still and now over twentyfive years old still is able to pack a tremendous punch you must watch this at some time even if it is a few episodes even at that you will still be blown away at the impact this documentary means to those who have been there suffered and died in the name of war in a world at war,1
indeed drug use warehouse shootthemups matrixesque bullet dodging a futuristic city with a mix of asian races and a lonely vampire all in the same movie seems like a story that could only be envisioned by a japanese poprock star and that is exactly what moon child is and more while all these elements combined may sound like the perfect subject for a campy bmovie of the week moon child pulls it off with but a few expected bumps and hitches along the waythe film has a gritty definitely independent feel to it jumping from one scene to the next not in smooth transition but rather sporadic leaps and bounds giving glimpses into the characters lives and barely scraping at a true plot but the film makes no excuses instead turning the story into one of friendship love trust and betrayal all sugarcoated in the aforementioned elements of a futuristic society warring gangsters and vampireshyde as the somber vampire kei is excellent giving depth to the character and balancingout the overlyzealous acting of gackt as sho an orphan who befriends kei leehom wang also shines as the vengeful son who becomes friends with a grownup sho the story revolves around these characters and their extended friends and family through different periods in their lives and how simple friendship can so easily be turned into grief and betrayalwhile the action at times is alltoo unrealistic and special effects appear just to showoff one thing the film never does is presume to be about the immensely popular asian singers it features the superstars as actors have their flaws and so do their characters the movie rarely gets boring and ends where it should after jumping about quite a bit moon child is rather enjoyable humorous at times and even very touching it is definitely worth your time,1
this should have been a movie about sam and his wife the glorious peter falk and equally glorious olympia dukakis that would have been a movie worth seeing instead it is a paul reiser vehicle with a little falk thrown in the wonderful elizabeth perkins is also in this movie but you would hardly know it i presume reiser is under the impression that he is a giant movie star who needs an appropriate vehicle he is not even more galling is that reiser took the trouble to hire some of the best women character actresses on the screen today and then shoved them all into his background dukakis does not show up until the last fifteen minutes but when she does the screen glows the story is about falk and dukakis really but we are subjected to a pointless silly preposterous road trip in which reiser gets to show how very cute precious and ohsodeep with psychological insight wrong he can be for instance in a restaurant scene that i imagine reiser had hoped was cassaveteslike there is a laughably false confrontation between reiser and falk that is so patently ridiculous i was embarrassed for falk,0
on this fourth of july weekend it is heartening to see the spirit of the declaration of independence alive and well in the film war inc just as our founding fathers gave the back of their collective hand to king george iii this film exposes in hilarious fashion the craven warprofiteering by the current crop of capitalistic creeps who are intent on indecently privatizing the government to include privatizing war itselfthe cast in this satire absolutely shines john cusack is wonderful as a droll conflicted corporate assassin and the beautiful marisa tomei is superb as his love interest my gosh george costanza was right marisa tomei is so attractive but it is johns sister joan cusack who really steals the film her portrayal of a bossy yet simultaneously sycophantic personal assistant is priceless and more than once i just could not stop laughing at the brilliance of her performance she not only possesses fantastic comic timing her face is as expressive as one could ever wish for in an actor dan ackroyd too has a short but very effective cameo in the film as the head of the company which is running the war the tamerlane corporation sitting on a throne with his pants down around his ankles ackroyd even looks like the arse clown who currently occupies one of our real thrones of power you will not have to think too hard to recognize that person much of this movie was filmed in bulgaria which is why we are able to see so much real military equipment you just know that the us military would never have cooperated in making this satiric expose of warprofiteering i especially enjoyed the character of omar sharif as played by the bulgarian actor lyubomir neikov in one scene in which he is on the dance floor with marisa tomei he has a couple of lines that could summarize our entire foreign policy attitude toward the foreign leaders we install  and uninstall  in powernaturally this film will not appeal to everyone if you believe that the ongoing privatization of our foreign policy the military intelligence collection and analysis prisons and the corrections system public health and a myriad of other government services is a good thing you may not find much to like in this film if you believe however that destroying people and countries in order to add to some corporations bottom line is an abomination i think you will find much to appreciate in this film nothing could be more in keeping with the spirit of independence that heaping welldeserved ridicule on corrupt powers that be,1
this is the first out of the guinea pig series and is one of the more infamous films out of the collectionit took me a long time to finally man up and get my hands on a copy of this notorious group of films i bought the guinea pig box set and decided to watch the collection in order by release date so i popped this sucker in and sat downfrom what i had read on the internet and realizing the content involved in this film i was expecting to test my nerves in full force this ended up not being the casethe film focuses on a group of men who kidnap a woman and begin torturing her with the hopes of discovering the human breaking point and how long a human can tolerate painsounds like one sick flick right wrong the film fails to shock this may be because i have become desensitized over the years do to my obsession with horror but i think it is safe to say that any true gorehound could sit through this with easeon the other hand an individual who does not have a well knowledge of this type of film will most likely be overwhelmed and disgusted by the images they see on the screen though it failed to shock me the film contains some pretty mean spirited and graphic scenes of violence including the ripping out of fingernails intestines thrown at an unconscious woman and a needle through the eyeoverall i think for majority of the gorehounds on this board that you should just get your hands on a copy of this film for the novelty of it but i suggest that for any new comers to these type of films that you should work your way up to this one,1
okay yes this was a verytightbudget movie with continuity errors like single scenes obviously filmed in sunshine and then in shadow and then mixed together and as much as i love nick mancuso he was often a little too good at the burntout part and some of the minor supporting cast was really bad plus at least one actor was used for two different but conspicuous roles but come on richard grieco was hysterical his hair alone is worth the trip steven ford was very likable mancuso had some great lines while nancy allen ironically was completely bland and uninteresting classic no bad parts yes entertaining big yes i would have loved to have been onset the day they decided what kind of hairstyle grieco would have are you fast  yare not that fast,1
the movie has only one flaw unfortunately this flaw damages all credibility of the pieceit starts with the condemnation of the israeli occupation of disputed territories it fails to address the reason israelis are there egypt syria iraq and jordan attacked israel this is why israel occupys their land because those countries lost it in a war they startedthe film also claims that israel has defied the you n by not complying with resolution two hundred and fortytwo problem is two hundred and fortytwo was rejected immediately upon it is inception bythe palestinians making it voidmany films are put together well and can really show footage that changes minds but remember when watching anything believe none of what you hear and only half of what you seeall participants in this film are known critics of israel and some have made many antisemitic public comments removing any possible credibility to their wordsall participants are in dire need of a actual history lesson taught objectively not by some palestinian sympathizer,0
i usually check out the mtv movie awards to watch a witty entertaining show that delivers a unique award show chewbacca winning a lifetime achievement award as example so this year was no different while i am not a fan of justin timberlake seann william scott has always been funnyalbiet stupidto me i have laughed at stiffler in both american pie movies and even enjoyed him in dude where is my car but the mtv movie awards were simply horrible nothing was coherrent humorous or entertaining justin timberlake should stick to singing and dancing he sure as hell cannot acti am curious as to who the writers were for this show last years performance by jack black and sarah michelle gellar was extremly funny the lord of the rings parody alone was worth watching the entire show but this year was completly different did anyone understand timberlakes comments regarding luke wilson and kate hudson they are staring in a movie together but have never met here they are where was the joke kate and luke just went into their lame dialogue never making a reference to the joke by timberlake and seann was completly wasted as a talent not even causing me to smile yet alone laugh and what was the point of harrison fords oneliners did they make any sense to anyone perhaps the mtv writers figured the young viewers would only know the aging ford as han solo indiania jones or the president from air force one i am baffled and would someone tell me the deal with adrian brody how old is this guy and how old does he think he is the guy looks thirty trying to act nineteen againgive it up show some class like in your best actor academy award speech and act your agei give this show one star out of four simply because of the speech by gollam for best visual performance this was very creative extremely well done and caused the only genuine laugh of the entire evening,0
a most recommendable masterpiece not only for the underlying themes of the story but also for the unmatchably brilliant and ingenious picture work of angelopoulos not to mention the acting of giants mastroianni and moreau and the remarkable character play by ilias logothethis gregory karrs performance may seem overshadowed by his tough partners at first stance but in fact he perfectly plays his character which is revealed in his very last scene with the girl khrysikou and the man mastroianni albeit hinted beforehand hence the spoilerget your expectations straight it is an art movie in whatever meaning that phrase has to offer and requires attention not for spending free time but for watching an artwork with the necessary concentration as in reading a book or attending a concert due to the overall photographic style large screen viewing is recommendeddialogues are used sparingly but the film includes in addition to the standard greek and english speaking fragments spoken in albanian kurdish and turkish which will be attractive for those who are charmed by the beauty in hearing various languages,1
wow i cannot believe i am the first and only one to post a comment on this great moviealthough the movie itself seemed interesting enough the real thing that attracted me to this one is matt lillard granted most people probably either think he is too caffeine happy or just plain sucks but we are both the same age and from the same generation and i have watched this guy so many times that he is one of my favorites now this is one of the few movies where he is the big shot and main star kind of like in slc punk another great lillard filmbaiscally this is storywise your usual heist movies but with more twists than anything which start to amount to craziness also very notable in this movie is another great actor named vincent donofrio a very under appreciated person in the film industry the woman in the movie is a newcomer and she is not too bad although you know they hired her mainly for her accent and the nude scene it is a game of jack vs jill vs bob as each want to reap the rewards but share with no one they all try to get eachother to kill off the other and it is a timebomb waiting to explode matt shows his true prowess as the scheming jack who initially starts the whole scheme vincent and woman play a couple of art thieves who are in need of money due to a lack of business vinces character is a bit deranged and skitzs throughout the movie but that only add to the intensity of the filmthe surprises left and right are well welcomed and the ending is very non cliche and makes you feel happy well maybe that depends on the type of endings you like this movie kept me very interested besides the fact matt was in it it is a great movie and i would highly recommend it to anyone who likes movies critics probably will not like this movie but they do not watch movies because they like movies anyway,1
being that this movie has a lot of fine entertainment qualities i think it should some more credit than it has been given on imdbit is your basic who done it thriller with sex and murder but it keeps you guessing right to the end i like these kinds of movies and i certainly think this one meets the standardto me it was worth watching more than once so i will give it an eight on imdb,1
mat spirogolous toby malone family know he is a talented footballer and are pleased when he secures an audition to join a big club they hope that when he arrives in the city his cousin will look after himbut the cousins are like chalk and cheese one a naive farm boy the other a streetwise spendthrift who has managed to get mixed up with drug dealers and gangsters mat is unlikely to have a quiet evening in before his big dayhaving missed his cousin george damien robertson on arrival in the city mat encounters further trouble when a young biker takes him for a ride in more ways than onetoby malone probably better known for his work in theatre puts in a commendable performance as the bucolic teenager there are telltale signs of a low budget but as with so many other lowbudget movies there is more fun seemingly more spontaneity and more charm than there is to be seen in the average hollywood blockbuster,1
i waited a while to post a review of this documentary because when i first saw it over ten years ago i wanted to think carefully about what i wanted to write i found from a documentary standpoint that this is a darned good documentary it did what it set out to do show me something i had no idea about and kept me interested in this world it explored i knew nothing of the drag world and finding out about them and the balls was just spectacular to me these folks were just so talented with what they do and how they do it for competition the catty folks the complainers even i was angry when someone told the judge that the coat the drag queen was wearing was not a mans coat the jealous it is all there like in every other competition like every other competition like it which i felt was a pointyou had the older drag queen talking about how the balls used to be compared to the newer drag queens who have changed the balls and made more competition categories  and even those who looked on knowing that the future of balls would change even more when they were ready to walk the runway it was interesting to hear that some of the contestants were living out on the street two minutes before the ball but came to compete it was that important to them then there was sad stories stories of who is house and house mother brought out the best and the brightest in competition it was interestingnow to add after ten years of seeing this film i lived through the so called madonna craze i spotted a few familiar faces from this documentary who ended up with madonna during her vogue phase and rightfully so if not for those individuals madonna would not have had a vogue phase i know that now credit should be given where credit is due makes me wonder if anyone else from mainstream america would watch this documentary they will learn they are not as mainstream as they think,1
years ago a movie going friend and i went to see a horror film that we thought would be good because it starred john cassavetes for the uninitiated john cassavettes was an actor screen writer and director married to actress gena rowlands nominated for oscars three times who wrote and directed a variety of good lowbudget films using his income as an actor to keep himself afloat up until seeing the incubus we did not understand that john cassavetes income was made from any movie that was offered to him had we known what the film was about before seeing it we may have avoided altogether but we did not walk out at the time my friend and i jokingly indicated it was the worst movie ever made now frankly this is not true i have seen many poorly made films on friday nights on cinemax did i just say that out loud that are far worse than the incubus almost any movie starring brian bosworth is by definition a worse movie than the incubus certainly santa claus conquers the martians is a worse movie than the incubus however i have since consistently used the incubus as a threshold below which i do not want to fall when talking to this friend about a movie i may have seen i will always remark that it was better or worse than the incubus,0
no artful writeup here because it does not deserve one not an art film not even one of those hidden gems you know like those movies you hear about through a friend who saw this amazing movie downtown where they show all the good independents and art filmsjust pack it into the christmas boxes and dispose of quickly,0
there be very little doubt that hg wells is the most influential writer of the twentyth century  jules verne has some claim to be the father of science fiction but his stories were more adventure stories using marvellous inventions as plot devices  wells was profound and brought subtext to his tales  perhaps his greatest legacy is that there is very little if any evidence that people believed in life on other planets before the twentyth century where as now many people including richard dawkins consider it a near certainty  there is no evidence of this of course and one cannot help wondering that is was wells who introduced this to human thinking  undoubtedly it was wells that planted the seed things to come was adapted by wells himself from his own novel  it is rather obvious however that he is unable to tell the difference between the technicalities of writing novels and writing screenplays  the dialouge is often laden  heavy handed and unconvincing  one case in point is the two pilots from opposing sides discussing the nature of war  why must we murder one another  why   this mirrors the criticism  near naked contempt that orwell had of wells in his essay wells  hitler and the world state and it is true that wells antiwar message is painfully overstated  it would be impossible to believe a conversation taking place between an raf pilot and his opposite number in the luftwaffe a few years later that said it is absolutely fascinating watching a film from one thousand nine hundred and thirtyfive predicting a world wide war taking place in one thousand nine hundred and forty that heralds the end of civilisation  there is a striking and haunting imagery as a child bangs a drum as a phantom army marches in the background and the collapse of society and the fear of the wanderng sickness is wonderfully realised  even the rather lazy storytelling of showing the year of the setting has a compelling nature it is the images that makes this film along with arthur bliss score that makes the film so memorable  and to be fair wells does ask the question  the universe or nothing  what shall it be    in short this is a film whose flaws are easy to forgive,1
i do not remember seeing another murdermystery movie as bad as this this movie about a medical examiner who investigates his friends mysterious death in a car accident has the complete receipt for a bad movie bad acting boring story lack of suspense poor humor and no drama i remembered seeing this movie on pax a tv station notable for dishing out lowbudgeted and campy madefortv movies such as this one tv movies of course do not have the edge factor or the suspense as movies from the big screen but this movie sure hit all sour tastes the makers of this movie have missed out on an opportunity to making receipe for murder a great tv movie the title does offer some suspenseso if you want a good recipe do not watch this movie this movie alone can kill your tv appetitegrade f,0
i thought king solomons mines was beautifully done my only reservation was alison doody her acting was superb but her makeup and hair was not of the period and always seemed to make her look out of place next to the other actors i thought patrick swayze was an excellent choice for alan quatermain it was nice seeing a seasoned rugged looking actor in this role after sitting through movie after movie with the fair haired fair skinned actors like val kilmer brad pitt etc he was an excellent choice and i enjoyed every minute of this movie this version cannot be compared with the one thousand nine hundred and fiftys version with stewart grainger it was a big screen movie and not a made for tv movie i thought both quatermains were believable but the two medias have to be kept separated i am looking forward to seeing this once more and i hope patrick swayze will again look to these type of roles,1
this is an art film that was either made in one thousand nine hundred and sixtynine or one thousand nine hundred and seventytwo the national film preservation foundation says one thousand nine hundred and sixtynine and imdb says one thousand nine hundred and seventytwo regardless of the exact date the film definitely appears to be very indicative of this general time periodwith some camerawork and pop art stylings that are pure late sixtysearly seventysthe film consists of three simple images that are distorted using different weird camera tricks these distorted images are accompanied by music and there is absolutely no dialog or plot of any sort this was obviously intended as almost like a form of performance art and like most performance art it is interesting at first but quickly becomes tiresome the film to put it even more bluntly is a total bore and would appeal to no one but perhaps those who made the film their family and friends and perhaps a few people just too hip and with it to be understood by us mortals,0
although there were some amusing moments i thought the movie was pretty lame the longer it ran the worse it got once the action entered monument valley i found myself watching the magnificent outcroppings more than the increasingly silly and unconvincing interaction of the charactersthe character of the daughter was particularly incoherent first she is in on the deal then discovers the truth and she bails then she is back again then deserts them again then she is back again there is no apparent motivation for any of her decisions there were interesting characters some interesting scenes and many missed possibilities i would have to say the pictures was much less than the sum of its parts apparently the people who liked repo man were inclined to like this one searchers twozero is no match for the searchers,0
any movie in which brooke shields outacts a fonda is going to be both an anomaly and a horror shields actually is only bad because she is youthful inexperienced and clearly not well directed by her costar peter fonda is bad because well because he is bad i liked him in ulees gold years later but lord above he is awful here not that anyone else is good there is not a single performance outside henry fondas delightful cameo that is even passable i have never seen a movie with this many bad performances in the case of luke askew the chief villain it is clear this is because of poor dialogue and direction as he is done good work in the past but his partner played by ted markland is an embarrassing ham the writing is just bloody awful and the actors cannot be faulted for the terrible things they have to say but they say them so badly the editing and direction are worse than pedestrian shots are held way too long for no dramatic reason or cut off before the impact of the scene can be realized this picture was far worse than i would imagined and would have been utterly forgotten and probably never even made without the participation of a couple of famous names one bright spot the cinematography in the grand canyon is exquisite capturing the beauty of that area in a way even bigscreen imax productions have not quite done so well and finally either this is a bad version of paper moon with a lovable pair of fatherdaughter types or it is a bad version of pretty baby with a considerably more icky romantic relationship between a fortysomething and a thirteenyearold it suggests more of the latter than the former and thus is pretty disturbing,0

errol flynn is gentleman jim in this one thousand nine hundred and fortytwo film about boxer jim corbett known as the man who beat john l sullivan directed with a light hand by flynns good friend raoul walsh the film also stars alexis smith jack carson alan hale sr william frawley and ward bond flynn plays an ambitious egotistical young man who has a natural talent for boxing and is sponsored by the exclusive olympic club in san francisco in the late one thousand eight hundreds though goodnatured the fact that he is a shanty irishman and a social climber builds resentment in olympic club members most of them cannot wait to see him lose a fight and they bet against him despite this he rises to fame even working as an actor finally he gets the chance he is been waiting for a match with the world champion john l sullivan ward bond sullivan demands a tenzero deposit to insure that corbett will appear to fight for the twentyfivezero purse corbett and his manager frawley despair of getting the money however help comes in the form of a very unlikely individualthis is a very entertaining film and jim corbett is an excellent role for flynn who himself was a professional fighter at one time he has the requisite charm good looks and athleticism for the role alexis smith plays victoria ware his romantic interest who insists that she hates him in real life she does not seem to have existed corbett was married to olive lake morris from one thousand eight hundred and eightysix to one thousand eight hundred and ninetyfivethe focus of the film is on corbett and his career rather than the history of boxing corbett used scientific techniques and innovation and is thought of as the man who made prizefighting an art form in the film corbett is fleet of foot and avoids being hit by his opponents it is believed that he wore down john l sullivan this waygood film to catch flynn at the height of his tooshort time as a superstar,1
because that is the only way you will not think this film is a total waste of time and money a remake of heaven can wait which was at least worth watching is a poor excuse for a romantic comedy it is more a vehicle to give rock some time on film for weak stand up comedy which does not play well on the big screen especially because his jokes generally are supposed to be from the body of an old fat rich dead man but are shown coming from rock himself as he insults blacks and whites the chemistry is all wrong the movie is not funny poorly shot the acting is weak at best go rent heaven can wait and a live rock video and you will be way ahead of the game,0
i have read some of the comments about this film and can only surmise that some people are easily entertained this movie is nothing it is so badly written directed and acted that it barely makes an impression the characters speak in clicheridden dialogue and the situations are completely implausible while that might make this campy and fun it does not because everything is so lifeless the film becomes dull it is as if lee rose decided to write a drama about a woman struggling with her sexuality but then she either was not allowed by studio execs to give the story some truetolife gusto or did not have the cojones this movie could go in the enyclopedia as the standardissue bad lifetime tv movie,0
complete drivel an unfortunate manifestation of the hypocritical toxic culture of a decade ago in this movie pedestrian regrets for slavery go hand in hand with colonialist subtexts the annoying redhead feeding shaka rice forget historical reality too did not most western slaves comes from west africa an american slaver easily capturing shaka with a handful of men finally david hasslehoff could not have been any more obnoxious one can only ponder how would he have fared in the miniseries promptly impaled most likely the miniseries was superb and it is unfortunate that dh should have gotten his hands on something unique and made it mundane i tend to think that he had hand in creating this fiasco,0
i do not expect this film to be well understood by viewers out of romania this tells something certainly about the value or maybe about the lack of universality of the film but also tells something about how different history and even life of common people was in romania compared to other countries even in eastern europethe film is an adaptation of a novel by marin preda a controversial novelist who died during the communist rule soon after the book was published it tells the story of an intellectual professor of philosophy whose life is crushed after he is imprisoned on false accusations at the end of the stalinist era basically the first part of the film tells the story of his fight for survival in prison the second describes his tentative to regain his life after being released his release is actually only apparent romania of the sixtys asks from him different types of compromises and crimes but yet his fight for survival is as tough morally as in prisonthe film is splendidly acted by some of the best romanian actors stefan iordache who has the lead role would be in another time and another place a megastar we can get here a good glimpse of his fabulous acting art although suffering from a hesitant storytelling and falling sometimes in nonessential details or character comics the film is still an important landmark for the romanian cinema as well as for the process of recovering the moral and historic values in the romanian society,1
when i started watching this movie i saw the dude from buffy xander and figured ah how nice that he is still making a living acting in movies now a weird movie i can stand given that it is a good dose of weird like for example david lynch movies twin peaks lost highway etc and you sort of have to be in the mood for one this one however made me mockingly remember the crazy websites about there about conspiracy theorys that make absolutely no sense i mean come on people nazis who conspire with america to make an unholy trinity of evil powers i was surprised they did not mention the hollow earth in this movie with hitler flying saucers and lizard people maybe if you had like sixty grams of heroine with this movie it would make some sort of sense but seriously i do not condone drugs like i do not condone this movie it should be burned shredded and forgotten just so good old xander might get another acting job it was not his acting though that was alright but the script just did not make any sense sorry,0
here is another movie that should be loaded into a satellite fired into space and pointed in the direction of the galaxy andromeda to show distant possible civilizations the best of humanity this movie is so endearingly stupid and revealingly honest in being little more than a ripoff of the already bad movie classic king kong from one thousand nine hundred and seventysix that it not only manages to upstage that film in terms of sheer belly laugh idiotic goofiness but successfully predicted much of peter jacksons miserable two thousand and five computer cartoon bearing the same name as far as a romance between the giant here a yeti and a gorgeous human female antonellina interlenghi of umberto lenzis city of the living dead who is very easy on the eyesthe film was made for kids so aside from some innuendo over fish bones and a bizarre nipple tweak to say goodbye you can forget about sex  the yeti even has a sort of giant jock strap to cover up his monstrous package the result being even more amusing than anatomical correctness but as a tradeoff you do get a wacky old scientist two inquisitive kids tony kendall in a rare turn as a duplicitous bastard of a villain a helpful intelligent collie dog who gets to have her own adventure dog adventure movies were big in europe for a while and of course emerges as the hero at the end for saving the yeti who turns out to be the good guy glorious stuff like front end loaders decorated to look like giant ape hands a monster who is size literally changes scale from shot to shot some inappropriately horrible deaths that will make the carnage in godzilla vs the smog monster look tame by comparison crowd reaction shots aplenty made up of either spanish italian or canadian extras depending upon scene you can sort of tell where they were shooting from how the extras are dressed and some of the most enthusiastically staged but inept special effects work ever in a giant monkey movieit is here that the film won me over it is enthusiasm just for being made frank kramer is actually the same gianfranco parolini who brought the world sartana in one thousand nine hundred and sixtyeight and gods gun the year before this  was a very important director in the spaghetti western and actionadventure genre film scene from the one thousand nine hundred and sixtysone thousand nine hundred and seventys and by the time of yeti he was probably delighted to get the work i would say that this is his most adventuresome movie ever or rather the one he took the most chances with and may have felt more comfortable taking those chances with the film aimed at kids  families the movie has a kind of reckless abandon to the way it was made that renders the technical errors or inconsistencies totally meaningless or rather they are part of the fun and if the movie had been played seriously it would not have worked  which is exactly why peter jacksons movie sucked he forgot to have fun with the material and let it dictate the outcome using his army of stupid power macintosh pod people animators and with all it is faults  clunkiness kramers yeti is actually closer to the spirit of why we watch movies like this which is partly to see actors in ape suits tearing apart miniature sets on sound stages not seamlessly animated vapid hours of nothing other than hard drive space i would rank this up there with king kong versus godzilla and it curse of the great golem as one of the most enjoyably improbable giant rampaging monster movies ever because the movie looks so fake you can get over the story and just have fun watching stuff get wrecked trampled tossed about and smashed knowing that and armed with a fertile energetic enthusiasm for having the chance to make the movie parolini pulled out all the stops and delivers a full bodied adventure that might get a bit rough for some of the small tykes but is the first movie i will ever share with the grandkids someday when their stupid parents leave them with me for a weekend this is stuff for the ages and one of the most telling expressions of humanity to ever be committed to celluloidtenten it is about ten minutes too long but who cares you only come around once and i would rather go out with a smile on my face,1
i can understand how fans of filmmaker roman polanski could love this movie and i could understand how some could totally hate it ebert was one of the few who could not understand why people were not running out of the theater after a first viewing i am not sure i could fall into either category however as someone who cannot get enough of kafka and bizarre dark comedies of paranoia the tenant is effective enough for its running time or maybe not this is one of those cases where it might have been more of a masterwork if it were a halfhour twilight zone episode with serling delivering the coda as terkovsky or whomever it might be writhes in his bed in bandages it is very similar in the treatment of the doomed protagonist as repulsion was however it could be argued that there was more ambiguity more of a sense of the surreal coming out through a sustained disintegration of character and location and quite frankly a better lead performance than the tenantas it stands the tenant does have an intriguing premise the kind that one does not tire telling about to other people polanski is a polish émigré to paris who takes an apartment that was most recently acquired by simone choule who jumped to her near death out of the window and died soon after but the other tenants are conservative to the max in terms of noise after a saturday night at terkovskys with a few friends there are complaints of too much noise it will not happen again polanskis goodnatured but slightly nervous tenant says but there is no peace even in moving a cabinet or a chair soon complaints get registered against another tenant but from him can he register complaints this is a case of not so much mistaken identity but of there being a lack of peace of mind with oneself and the surrounding people as the downward spiral goes on polanski ratchets up tension and dare i say blackcomedic laughs by showing terkovsky in the midst of a horrible dream one of polanskis strongest scenes from the period and in finding teeth in the wall not to mention the bathroom across the way which i might add is always a cinematic lynchpin of horror and surreal madnessbut somehow the film never really feels all that significant aside from its excessive design as a wouldbe mindf machine with terkovskys tenants only seeming to not be what they seem for a little while there is not as much suspense when finding out that they really are not out to get him which makes the paranoia more selffulfilling at least once or twice i thought to myself as well why did polanski take the title role for himself it is not that he is at all a bad actor and he has appeared in several films and plays that are not of his own direction but aside from being great at looking awkward and tense like in the church or in his moments of sort of flipping out when thinking that they really are out to get him to kill himself his transformation is less creepy than tongueincheek a test of himself to see if he can pull it off which he does not entirely do despite polanski working at it well to look like the meek and frazzled terkovsky i could see at least a few other actors who could pull it off with more subtlety and affecting personality by the time one sees him in drag it goes between cringeworthy and true camp particularly when he goes for the doubleclimax at the end which of course is of little surpriseand yet there is pleasure for the filmbuff and polanski fan to see the supporting cast try and dig into the much more ambiguous characters winters and douglas do this the best even as they have to strain through limited characters and the unexpected moments like polanski and adjani getting hot and heavy during a bruce lee movie or when he gets really drunk or in one almost random scene where he slaps a kid near a fountain are rather brilliant in and of themselves it is a very good film and one that could maybe stick my attention up when on too many coffees after midnight but an essential film not exactly,1
follow the fleet an rko production in one thousand nine hundred and thirtysix stars fred astaire and ginger rogers in a complex romantic comedy although fred astaire and ginger rogers have had many similar romantic movies together rko helped them to once again create a worthwhile storyline that incorporates relevant situations to society at the time it was made the narrative of follow the fleet relies heavily on the use of layered story lines between the two sets of main characters to create a satisfying romantic comedythe general plot of the movie revolves around bake baker a sailor in the yous navy played by fred astaire and sherry martin bakes former love and dance partner who is now a singer and dancer played by ginger rogers their story begins when bake is on the ship and his shipmate bilge smith finds a photo of the two of them together and bake reveals that the last time he saw her he had asked her to marry him so bilge suggests that they try and meet up with her when they are on land in hopes that she might have a friend the next major scene begins the second plot of the movie when connie martin sherrys sister is refused entry into paradise where her sister works unless she is escorted by a gentleman she turns around to find bilge behind her with a bag full of beverages so she plays it off like she was waiting on him and buys his entrance into paradise as well connie then finds sherry and tells her that she is depressed because she cannot have the luck sherry does with men so sherry suggests she get a makeover from her friends while she is performing on stage connie gets made over and enters the ballroom once again and approaches bilge again who is awestruck by the sight of her this commences the second romantic storyline between bilge and conniethroughout the remainder of the movie the story and rising actions are transitioned between altering comedic reliefs of the two couples troubles that create several mini rising and falling actions within the overall plot bake and sherry hit it off their first moments together as they compete in a dance competition and end up winning it reminding them of the success and pleasure the two have when they are together similarly bilge is able to swoon connie through his romantic attempts of pleasing her and they retire to her house this series of happy events is soon followed by unsettling measures that brings the rising action back down bake left sherry the previous night to retire to the ship before midnight and told her that he would come for her in the morning unfortunately the ship sets course after the shipmates have returned upsetting sherry and leaving her to think bake was still being a typical sailor looking for a good time when he is on land the mood is again changed as another subplot is entered into the film when a party of big shots is taking a tour of the ship this alternate storyline is used to create a buffer between the stories of the two main relationships of the film as well as help build confidence and fondness of bakes overall good intentions the party is interrupted by the oblivious music playing coming from bake and his companions when they missed the sounding to report on deck for the company the ladies are intrigued and ask to hear them play and bake gladly begins to entertain them with some dancing which ultimately helps brighten the mood of the film as well as bring happiness to the sailors after returning to the couples intertwined stories sherry is trying to prove to bake that she does not need his help with landing a job unfortunately bake is unaware that she is auditioning and goes to put in a good word for sherry when he overhears his friend at the studio talking about the remarkable lady auditioning bake takes it upon himself to help sherry out by tampering with her water making her unable to sing correctly and destroying her audition in addition to bakes mistake connie spent all of her money to repair a ship that she was hoping bilge would take over as captain she had also planned a remarkable dinner date for him when he was supposed to come over but bilge was aware of her intentions and hopes of soon marrying and was no longer interested so he stood her up the remainder of the movie continues in the same format of mini rising and falling actions until the climactic point is reached between the two couples ending the movie with the happiness of both couples the use of the altering stories helps to build interest and emotion within each couple as they deal with both happiness and pain through each of their struggles the intertwining stories are also able to relate with one another as well as incorporate other unrelated subplots to help carry the narrative through to the concluding scenes although fred astaire and ginger rogers have countless films together that incorporate romance comedy song and dance follow the fleet is a unique film for the two actors that successfully use the technique of subplots to aid the narrative between the two main characters,1
while being a great james arness western this film has gone down as the worst alamo film ever made the story was terrible inaccuracy all through it and just downright untruths to boot continuity was cast to the four winds anybody catch the cannon sequence the mexicans were dumb enough to fire cannons that obviously had mud and ramrods still sticking out of the tubes come on then there is brian keiths ridiculous hat costumer must of been away or something or just out of their mind,0
little edie and big edie are characters that anyone can feel compassion for even though their house was filthy this is somehow understandable considering their mental illness on the message board a poster wrote that little edie has the coping skills of an eight year old this reminded me of when in the dramatized two thousand and nine version big edie says to little edie if you are stuck it is only with yourself these women had everything beauty talent intelligence firm belief in their opinions and actions perhaps if little edie was not so hard on herself the first time things did not work out losing her hair her job and the love of her life she would have made it this somehow ties into what i believe is her mental illness her inability to pick herself up when times are hard and see that good times lie ahead the world will never know what have happened if she did not listen to her moms plea come home edie let me take care of youyet these understandably insecure women somehow manage to be brilliant heartbreaking and lovable even in their extremely filthy home these women were extraordinary and their interaction with each other bring humor and sadness when edie had one of her emotional breakdowns dwelling about what could have been or about how she wants to get out of her home because she feels like a little girl one gets the intense urge to hug her and tell her that everything will be okay great documentarynineten,1

verhoevens movie was utter and complete garbage he is a disgusting hack of a director and should be ashamed by his own admission he read two chapters of the book got bored and decided to make the whole thing up from scratchheinlein would have never supported that trash if he would been alive to see it it basically steals the name mocks politics of the book which is a good portion of it and throws in some ta so the average idiot american moviegoer does not get boredthis anime is not perfect but it is at least mostly accurate as best i can tell,1
a good film withfor its timean intense sprawling rather dark story somewhat reminiscent of john fords the searchers though not so brutal the story starts fast and does not let up with several scenes of really good dialog between stewarts jeff webster ronda castle and sheriff gannon this film is in some ways reminiscent of bend of the river one thousand nine hundred and fiftytwo also a mannstewart work but i found it far less sentimental and more interesting there are a few caveats a tooquickly wrapped up and rather sentimental ending twentyfouryearold corrine calvert is not very convincing as a naive french teenager and of course the film takes place in the mythic west a land of fable where the real laws of nations and physics do not apply but these are trivial concerns james stewart is surprisingly good as a dark disengaged man who thinks he cares for no one but himself and the mountain scenery cannot be beat a fine western costume drama,1
if you ever hear these three words uttered to youjoe don baker be afraidfinal justice is the low budget action movie based on a sheriff in a texas town named geronimo pronounced as heronimo he is an ugly slimy rude character who is on the hunt for a criminal in malta who killed his partner in texas his partner actually slumps down twice in the movie very bad editing joe don baker geronimo ends up in jail like four or five times in this movie making the plot go nowhere fast plus he shoots everybody like he is in the wild west i guess nobody told him it was the twentyth century a woman cop is assigned to show him around malta who looks like elaine from seinfeld and she is the only one who can put up with the redneck she must be insanethe strippers in the bar are the most entertaining characters in this movie their dancing is shown throughout the film and i began to bond with the sleazy women well at least it was better than watching geronimo try to dumb his way out of something the ending is flawed and somewhat predictable and i was happy it was finally over you will never forget that last line of joe don baker from the movieit is so hard to imagine how he was in three bond moviesvery weird anyway if you are up for a laugh then see this one on mstthreek sometime also i have heard his other bad movie among many mitchell mstthreek version is being released on dvd by rhino i cannot wait to see that,0
it is been a looooonnnggg time since i saw this comedy and i would forgotten just how idiotic it is i would place this easily in the lower two or three of elvis presleys very worst movies presley plays joe whitecloud a halfbreed indian bull rider who returns home to arizona and the brokendown shack where his family lives and where his friends love to party all night long his parents are played by burgess meredith and katy jurado and his old indian grandpa is thomas gomez none of the three offer anything of substance  comically or otherwise the government has invested in the familys cattle but they are lacking a bull elvis gets to sing just a few utterly worthless songs and is pursued by a young boycrazy gal and her guntoting mother this is just a real slapdash of a mess and the dilapidated surroundings practically stink of manure and do not make this much easier the one thing that puzzles me however is that elvis actually seems to be having a good time in the film hard to believe considering he got so upset about being stuck making so many mediocre movies,0
do not get fooled with all the big names like burt reynoldsjames woods and anne archer they are just glorified extras their scenes were probably filmed in one day or so whatever their motives for being in this movie if you have an actor like james woods you better make good use of him to me this is a sign of bad direction through and through the plot itself was not that bad and the acting from most of the actors was above average cuba gooding jr however was terrible he was so unbelievable that i almost laughed at his dramatic scenes and since this was meant as a serious movie that cannot be a good thing the action scenes were not badbut they lacked that special punch to make it more exciting again better direction was needed also the pacing was wrong for a movie like this it took the main character almost half an hour to get in action for an action thriller of only ninety minutes that is far too slow the only redeeming factor is angie harmon she does her best to make it all work too bad the director left her hanging yesthis movie could have been much better with a great director andy cheng is far too inexperienced as a director to pull it off and for an actionstunt coordinator of his caliber you would expect at least more exciting action scenes do not waste your time with this one avoid,0

at first glance this documentaryfictioncartoon is quite entertaining and thought provoking of course when something provokes thought it can then be scrutinized the reality is this movie combines metaphysics with innuendo and baseless conclusions the link that what the bleep would have you see between science and spirituality is in fact not rooted in science at all the transcendental meditation study mentioned in the film claims that meditation by a group can reduce crime in a given area washington dc in this case in reality the hra homicides rapes and assaults crime rate was about thirty higher in one thousand nine hundred and ninetythree than the average crime rate between one thousand nine hundred and eightyeightone thousand nine hundred and ninetytwo there was absolutely no decrease in the homicide rate during the study in fact each and every claim that links metaphysics to science can and has been debunkedmy conclusion from this information is that this movie is either a poor attempt to indoctrinate people or a joke either way i suggest that you do not waste your timeif you are looking for a long winded movie about science that could provoke thoughts you might consider mindwalk one thousand nine hundred and ninety,0
despite louis b mayer reportedly not being interested in signing the young greta garbo to a contract this first american and mgm film for the actress looked quite beautiful it is obvious that the film was assigned some amazing talent to film the production and make matte paintings as it has all the nice polish and artfulness you would expect from the best pictures the studio could produce it simply looks beautifuleven eightyfour years lateras for garbo herself like her other very early american films she too looks different while she is quite recognizable her makeup is much softer than it would become just a year latergiving her a less severe look and a gentleness about her you just did not see in subsequent films i kind of wish they would kept this look but considering how famous she would become with the trademark look who am i to say they should not have gone that route the film is about garbo and how she and her family are unfairly forced off their land by the landlord while the landlady the much esteemed doña bernarda claims it is because the bank has demanded payment it is because her son has fallen for garboand what better way to get rid of her than to force them out on the streets nice lady huh years pass and by now garbo has become a new singing sensation who is worldfamous when she returns to her hometown years later her old boyfriend who had promised to marry her but wimped out when his mother doña bernarda refused to allow it sees her his new love for another lady is now testedwill he be content to marry this lady who is the heir to a huge pig fortune or will he want his old flame and more importantly will garbo even take him back after he behaved so spinelessly in the meantime a huge rainstorm hits the land begins to flood and homes soon are being washed away by the deluge cortez and a friend make a mad dash as the dam breaks in a scene where they obviously superimposed his row boat over the cascading stream he eventually makes it out alive and to the home where garbo is now staying she welcomes them inside and they stay with her until the storm passes then he admits that he still loves her and had braved the storm to make sure that she was safe she tells him to get lost next you see ricardo about to get married to his second choice the daughter of the pork king he obviously has little enthusiasm for thisand you feel sorry for the lady as she did nothing wrong soon cortez is seen wandering back to garbos homehe is lovesick and needs her in this scene garbo is quite luminous and cannot tell him to leaveas they dissolve in each others arms once again he tells her of his love for herwhen doña bernarda learns of this she is not pleased evidently a pork queen is a better catch than an internationally known singer because of the meddling of this nasty old lady garbo leavesunwilling to come between the mother and her wimpy son but cortez comes runningannouncing he must have her and will not rest until he has her as his wife moments after making this proclamation a family friend talks to cortez and convinces him to give her up for the good of his career and reputation so much for will not rest until he has her for his wife huh despite cortez being a wimp through and through for some reason she cannot bring herself to hate him and so he marries the pork queen and lives a very dull life when years later garbo meets cortez again he is a dull looking middleaged manwhile she is as beautiful as ever and not surprisingly she tells him once again to get lostat the time this film was made garbo was not a star in the us and cortez was so in light of this it is surprising they gave cortez such an unlikable character to play instead of the usual confident valentinolike role they would been giving him here he is an indecisive wimpa huge wimp and from here on his career was on a slow downward spiral as for garbo the role helped establish her as a big staras she was the focus of the film and played a character much like her later personasas for the film the new music composed for it was very nice though a tad repetitive the print oddly was nearly perfect throughout except for the intertitle cardswhich could use some restorationa most enjoyable filmexpertly constructed wistful and worth seeing and for one of the few times i can think of it i have no real complaints in this excellent film,1
awful dreams wild premonitions blasphemy and homosexual fantasies permeate paul verhoevens arguable masterpiece of a true femme fatale who loves her men then kills them filled with blood and occasional gore the fourth man is truly neurosis inducing men will literally leap when renee swings out her scissors,1
soldier blue is a movie with pretensions pretensions to be some sort of profound statement on mans inhumanity to man on the white mans exploitation of and brutality towards indigenous peoples a biting unflinching and sardonic commentary on the horrors of vietnam well sorry but it fails miserably to be any of those things what soldier blue actually is is pernicious trite badly made dishonest rubbishanother reviewer here hit the nail on the head in saying that it appears to be a hybrid of two entirely different movies what it is basically is a lame clichéd poorly acted odd couple romance  strauss and bergen overcoming their prejudices about the others lifestyle and falling in love ah bless  bookended by two sickening massacres which would not have been out of place in a lucio fulci splatter flickthere is no excuse for the repulsive prurient goredrenched climax in which cute little native american children are variously shot sliced dismembered and impaled in loving and graphic closeup and largebreasted native american women are molested raped and strung up  no excuse that is except box office the massacre itself whilst repulsive in its misplaced intention is very badly staged and shot a bunch of actors lying around with bright red paint smeared on them intercut with a few specialeffects sequences of beheadingdismemberment  dismemberments incidentally which utilised real amputees in their filming now that is what i call exploitationforget all the pap you have heard including the ludicrous commentaries that begin and end the movie about this being a protest an indictment of american brutality towards the native peoples this film does not give a stuff about the plight of the cheyenne had it done so it would have featured some involving native american characters would have led us to get to know and to care about the nameless faceless innocents who get slaughtered at the climax instead what we get is the silly white bread romance of bergen and strauss lousy actors both in this at least with plenty of blood guts and severed heads thrown in to attract the curiouswhich is a terrible shame because there is a movie to be made about the sand creek massacre about all of the real life massacres the us and britain and all socalled civilised nations have participated in over the centuries iraq this just is not that movie,0
this is by far one of the most boring and horribly acted accounts of the early days of adolf hitler that i have ever watched robert carlyle is a wonderful actor but to cast him as hitler is just plain wrong to cast liev schrieber as hitlers longtime friend and aid haefengstal must have emitted cries of despair and anguish from the simon wiesenthal centre a jw playing a nazi supporter bad bad bad casting this was not an enjoyable family film with a good historical background this was hollywood rubbish at its finest cashing in on the strength of a strong but sorely under utilized supporting cast of actors whom seemed to have all but disappeared from the acting radar in the past five yearsthe fake german accents vee vill vin zis var is insulting to german people everywhere my mother is german and she sat fuming at the sound of the voices which kept switching from americanenglishgerman all in the same sentence the supporting cast make better cardboard cutouts at the local video store than they do on screen jenna malone as the fated geli raubal was splendid though she captured the innocence and confusion of this tragic young woman who ultimately ended her own life to escape what her future would have been like in hitlers shadowif you would like a tremendously fantastic and historically accurate account of hitlers early years leading up to and including the warholocaust rent inside the third reich one thousand nine hundred and eightythree starring rutger hauer as albert speer and derek jacobi as hitler it was good and made more sense then this baloneyas a historical researcher of the third reich i can honestly tell you this had me reaching for my books to confirm its myriad of inaccuracies,0
this could be a strong candidate for the worst flick ever perhaps without the presence of john hurt it could be tolerated as a kidfilm however the tragedy of this entire endeavor is that john hurt one of the screens greatest actors diminishes himself in thisi gave it two points just because mr hurt showed upi take away eight points because he did not run from it fast enough as far as the rest of the cast they are simply terrible janine turner as pretty as she might be cannot act to save her soul and the lead actor is for all intents and purposes awful if you can spare yourself this embarrassment please do so it is so bad it almost hurts,0
over the years i have seen a bunch of these straight to video segal movies and every one holds the same amount of entertainment unfortanetley the entertainment level is at a low sure the action sequences were amusing but that was pretty much it seagal was really in his prime when he did movies like under siege under siege two and executive decisionat least on the action standpoint but during the past ten years these types of movies that star segal really do not meet his past qualificationson the more positive side the movie did make good use of time like some of the action sequences and use of wit just when the movie seemed to just drag on a pretty cool action scene brought it up out of the gutter i honestly believe that more of segals movies would do better if he was not the only one that fans recognize in the movie supporting actors and actresses are a very important thing and if his current movies had this known supporting actors and actresses maybe the movie will get more popular results,0
this is a documentary i came across by chance on the uk tv channel morefour and i have to say i found it extremely interesting and thought provoking i will also be seeking out the book that was the source material for this documentary basically this is professor jared diamond theory on why certain parts of the earths societies prospered and others did not the argument he presents was new to me and argued about how the fortune of the right crops and the right animals that where able to domesticated is certainly a compelling one as for the documentary itself it is well shot and well narrated with not to much of the recreated scenes that spoil many a modern documentary diamond also helps by not being to condescending which is a fault of a lot of intellectuals when trying to get a message to the masses people have claimed his theory is marxist but i do not buy this and see it more socio geologist it was also refreshing to hear an theory on the evolution of society not based around religion highly recommended viewing,1
a few weeks ago the german broadcaster satone advertised this movie as the tvevent of the year  sorry but i have seen better things on tv this yeari did not thought much of the movie but i soon reminisced about two other horrible movies when i watched the commercial  namely titanic and pearl harbor because the picture looked so familiar the heroine if i can really call her that in the middle and her two lovedones next to her  pearl harbor anyone in fact the lovestory is a poor mans version of the one in pearl harbor and that one was already poorbut as i like watching movies and analyzing their patterns i eventually decided to watch that rubbish the movie begins with a doctor leaving his family for the military strike against russia near the end of the third reich promising his wife that he will return now fast forward to spring one thousand nine hundred and fortyeight germany lost the war and the allies  russia captured the country and they both try to eliminate each other for world power and their ideologies capitalism versus communism well i guess you already know the story because you have to know it  the movie does not really bother with it so much and literally takes a dump on historical facts the movie tries to depict the us government as angels and completely ignores the contribution of other countries during the airlift especially great britain who was responsible for nearly a quarter of the rations despite having their country bombed from a country that they are trying to helpwhat was also pretty annoying were the historical remarks the people said in the movie like when the heroines mother tells her daughter that germany might be parted in two with a response like that is impossible or when stalin where the director thought we just stick similarly looking mustache on the actor and he will look like him says that russia has to stop coca cola from spreading in germany yeah right if stalin has ever said something like this or there is this one us pilot who tells his fellow of a bread with meat and everything possible in it  please burgers were invented way before that timein the movie you once see a map showing the airlines funnily enough the map looks like it came straight out of a laser printer  in fortyeight the us general lucius clay who is main idea was to stay in berlin is portrayed as a guy who is mean and grumpy and all the ideas he historically had like for example the airlift and improving on that idea came from the fictive character phillip turner the love interest of the main actress which leads me to other aspects not enough africanamerican soldiers in the movie there were like two in the whole film also relationships between us soldiers and german civilians was not allowed and by a revealing of such a relationship the us soldier would have been sent home i do not want to say that there were no relationships at all but in this movie there was a couple that almost got married if it was not for the death of the pilot in his fake cgi plane which looked terribly unrealistic especially the cgi fireif it was not enough all americans in this movie spoke accentfree german although they only were in germany for a couple of months  look i am also american living in germany for my whole life and even i have a little accent notably bad was also the child acting  the kids had like two expressions on their faces normalilookmonotonouslikearobot and grinningall in all the movie was boring from beginning to end moving way too slow especially the love story which was the same as the one in pearl harbor just with half of the dialogue the sad part is that the movie was very successful  eightninetyseven millions watched the first part and seveneightythree millions the second part the day after thus satone receiving two consecutive wins in the overall market share and a whopping win in the commercial relevant group but like i always think the biggest pile of bullcrap is where the most flies go to,0
the plot a crime lord is uniting three different mafias in an entreprise to buy an island that would then serve as moneylaundering facility for organized crime to thwart that the fbi tries to bust one of the mafia lords the thing goes wrong and by some unlikely plot twists and turns we are presented with another cop buddies who do not like each other movie one being a female fbi agent and the other a male exdea agentso far so stupid but the strength of this movie does not lie in its story  a poor joke at best it is funny at least the synchronized german version is the action is good too with a memorable scene involving a shot gun and a rocket launcher but the focus is squarely on the humour not intelligent satire not quite slapstick but somewhere in between you get a lot of funny jokes however this film is the opposite of political correctness legal drug abuse is featured prominently without criticism and even displaying it as cool that is the bit of the movie that seriously annoyed me and renders it unsuitable for kids in my opinion all in all for a nice evening watching come acceptable action with some funny jokes this movie is perfect just remember in this genre it is common to leave your brain at the door when you enter the cinema  tv room then you will have a good time eightten,1
this movie is one of the many kung fu action films made in asia in the late seventys  early eightys full of cheap sound effects dubbed dialog and lightning fast martial arts action but unlike most films of this genre it also has a decent plot and lots of great comedy when workers of a dye factory are forced out of their jobs by manchu bullies they hire a conartist gordon liu to try to scare them off when his attempt fails miserably he cons his way into a shaolin temple to learn to fight for real but instead of making him a kungfu student the master instead orders him to build a scaffolding to cover the roofs of all thirtysix chambers well it turns out that while he is performing these menial tasks stacking and tying bamboo poles that he is learning the skills to be a kungfu expert it is sort of like in karate kid when mr miagi teaches daniel the basics of karate by having him do routine household chores wax on wax off et cetera there is lots of great comedy from beginning to end and plenty of action at the end when gordon liu once again faces his manchu tormentors this time it is not just tricks it is the real thing liu declares proudly thumping his chest if you like classic kung fu films you do not want to miss this one,1
i really think that this movie is great personally but in every movie there is a downer now some of you may not have watched hilary duffs raise your voice but if you think about it those two shows are very very similar if you know what i mean in brave new girl holly wants so bad to get into haverty conservatory in raise your voice terri wants to go to a conservatory in lado not remember the name of the conservatory there they are both in the music field and they both have to sing at the ending of the semester it is really funny how these two films are alike i personally like brave new girl better than raise your voice though,1
i just watched the convent for the second time i had enjoyed it previously and figured it would make for a good drunken friday night film some gore some style bit of humour and suchlike i was saddened to find that i could no longer appreciate it much it seemed like someone had set out to revisit cheeseball epics like night of the demons for a modern audience but lost the things that made the original worthwhile for the record i am not even a huge fan of night of the demons but there were some things i really dug about it the convent does the cheese but the not the goodness so much apart from the main girl likeable performance from joanna canton the goth girl and a sweet cameo from adrienne barbeau pretty much all the characters were excruciatingly unlikeable festering at the absolute lowest levels of moronic offensive jockhood the film is then gravely hampered by the complete lack of gratuitous nudity which means that given the awful dialogue it is difficult to watch the characters and harder to appreciate the good points of the film the evil nuns are original in design and get lots of good scenes though not scary their certainly kind of cool and the film also fields a fair amount of neat gore towards the end when adrienne barbeau is on the scene the film becomes quite entertaining because all the obnoxious people are dead and its an evil nun bashing frenzy the stylised direction also occasionally yields good results although sometimes the camera just moves too fast all in all this was a film where for me the shining good points just cannot make up for the things i hated those more fond of this kind of film may well enjoy it a lot more but for me it was not a good time,0
transylvania sixfive thousand is an insignificant but occasionally funny and charming mid eightys horror parody with some very familiar names in the cast and a handful of genuine opportunities to chuckle in the script two bozo journalist of a gossipy tabloid newspaper are sent very much against their will to transylvania to do a story on the alleged return of mad scientist frankenstein there are some adorable little gimmicks and details to discover left and right in the film like a little guillotine for hardboiled eggs and laboratory test tubes that are being used to put in cream and sugar at the breakfast table the wholesome of the film however is not as successful as it could and should have been with jokes and parody situations that are way too overlong the roger corman production transylvania twist which came out four years after this is a lot funnier and much more recommended the film is particularly parodying the classic universal milestones of the early thirtys so you better make sure you have seen those if you want to grasp all the tiny gags and references there is a pretty original twist indicating that the frankenstein character only behaves like a madraving evil scientist when he enters his laboratory it is also revealed that he is actually more of a father damien sort of messiah who is only concerned with the condition of exiled monsters michael richards the freaky guy who plays kramer in seinfeld stars as a psychotic butler who appears and disappears at the most inappropriate moments i am pretty sure john turturros character in mr deeds was inspired by richardss role here,0
okay i have always been a fan of batman i loved the animated series and even batman beyond i even read a batman comic now and then so as can be imaginedi was a little excited when i heard about this series and then i was severely disappointed this series is nothing it does not even begin to compare with the original series it is like one long toy commercial no depth whatsoever and what the heck was with the joker whoin my most humble opinion is the best batman villain of all time and they killed him i wish i could say his design was the worst part actually i wish i could say there was anything about this series that was remotely creative or interesting in short because believe me i could say so much moredo not waste your time on this show or your money,0
this recreation of the infamous one thousand nine hundred and fiftynine murders in kansas based on the capote book is starkly filmed by brooks and cinematographer hall in black and white giving it a documentary feel there are good performances from blake and wilson as the killers and forsythe as a cop who pursues them the scenes leading up to the murders filmed at the actual house where the crime occurred with a soundtrack of whistling winds are quite intense and chilling brooks directs with a lot of verve and uses several interesting transitions between scenes the only complaint is that it is a bit overlong with the denouement dragged out and somewhat preachy,1
this documentary or i should say mockumentary is the perfect example of how ridiculous can the people be when they have full enthusiasm on something like that honestly i hate cryptozoology it is unscience it just destroy it however something positive in this was the visual effects dragons were beautiful but some of the information in this mockumentary was totally fake and that is really disappointing because it was coming from scientists so that is the reason why it deserves a one of ten and not a zero an example of false information would be the hydrogen idea it is true that according to chemystry the hydrogen is produced in the stomach but it is impossible to be produced in that proportions so in that case you need a good explanation of what really happens in a dragon stomach there are a lot of substances whit hydrogen in the nature but not the necessary to aloud an animal like that to fly and the hydrogen does not appear from nothing so it is impossible anyway there is actually something worse the idea of the platinum this element is more difficult to find than gold and i cannot explain myself how dragons survive depending of that it is ridiculous they present dragons like creatures with low chances of conquering the planet earth but off course at least that explain why they got extincted probably cryptologists call themselves scientists but they are not people like them say lies like in this mockumentary and what is worst some people buy them but i do not think that a person who cares about science would believe in dragons after watching this those fake scientists waste their time,0
a heartwarming film the usual superb acting by john thaw who passed over recently a man who was always so unassuming he was one of englands top ten actors certainly of my timehe can be remembered for his famous role of inspector morse as jack regan in the one thousand nine hundred and seventys hit tv series the sweeney and as a barrister in kavanah qc a must see for all the family and a great dvd for my collection the filming will bring back a few memories for people who remember wartime britain and certainly those who were evacuated out of london to escape the german bombings the interaction between the two main characterstom and the boy william was really well acted and true to the book by michelle magorian,1
this film came recommended as a good action film which i do not really think it is i found the story convoluted and not all that easy to follow there really is not that much action until the end of the film and it is pretty dark and hard to see what is really happening i was sure hoping for something different but alas did not find it here,0
if you are at all interested in pirates pirate movies new orleansearly nineteenth century american history or yul brynner see this film for yourself and make up your own mind about it do not be put off by various lacklustre reviews my reaction to it was that it is entertaining well acted for the most part has some very witty dialogue and that it does an excellent job of portraying the charm appeal and legendary fascination of the privateer jean lafitte while not all the events in the film are historically accurate can you show me any historical film that succeeds in this i feel the film is accurate in its treatment of the role lafitte played in new orleans history and the lovehate relationship between the respectable citizens of new orleans and this outlaw who was one of the citys favorite sons do not worry about what the film does not do but watch it for what it does do ie for its study of one of new orleans and americas most intriguing historical figures,1
cmon people look at the title lol i remember seeing this movie on saturday late night creature features years ago it is a great cheesy monster flick with hilariously bad acting and two wonderfully moronic hillbillies that add to the schlock factor the two redneck boat rental guys are the movie lol and you will love the boat scene where the english guy and his wife are talking about all the stars and it is midday and sunny bloody hilarious you can tell they just did not care about plot they just wanted to blow through the filming of the movie as fast as possible bottom line you will love it if you love seventys schlock,1
i was a little skepticle if i should watch this when it was first shown on cbs i was one of the many people who were in nyc on that day i was going to school at hunter college i did not want to see all the devistation and carnage again but like many i was curious to see what this was all about tears came to my eyes watching this documentary all my memories returned and just the intense images were unbelievable i bought the dvd on the one year anniversary and watched it a few times how these guys were able to capture this footage was incredible if you have not seen this documentary do yourself a favor and check it out it is obviously depressing and will bring tears to eyes but it is an incredible document of this countries darkest hour,1
maybe i am missing something because i have read more positive things about the man who cheated himself than i have read bad reviews  and i just do not get it i like my noirs to have a little style to them with characters that speak look and act like humphrey bogart in the big sleep or gene tierney in laura none of the characters in this movie have that style or presence or whatever you want to call it take the lead actor lee j cobb his rumpled rolledoutofbed look is about as far from the dashing smoothtalking noir archetype as you will find or take jane wyatt as the femme fatale as another example this is one of the worst cases of miscasting i have seen in a while she is just not convincing in the roleas for the plot it is tired and lacks any real surprises or anything new for the genre i could have predicted the outcome of the man who cheated himself after about five minutes and that final catandmouse chase scene is plain old dull ten to fifteen minutes of nothing happening really ruined any pacing the movie may have had going for it,0
comedies often have the unfortunate reputation of having little real depth arms and the man proves that notion to be false shaws play is full of comedic drama combining an entertaining plot with true philosophical depthon one level arms and the man is a successful and somewhat unique romantic comedy the young melodramatic and superficial raina comes from a military family deeply involved in a war her fiancé and her father are both military officers she is shocked one night by the arrival of an enemy soldier she rescues him knowing that she will have to keep the incident a secret from her family forever and the soldier eventually leaves of course once the war is over that soldier comes back forcing each of the primary characters to reevaluate their values and their relationshipsit is quite interesting how shaw layers meaning within the rather standard comedic plot shaw manages to comment on class constructs on the absurdity of war and even on the nature of love and of course he does this with the shavian wit and within a satisfying plot there is so much here to think about that i think a lot can be missed in a single viewing arms and the man is excellent comedic theater and is definitely one of shaws best worksarms and the man is both an amusing and thoughtprovoking movie that retains its relevance even today more than a century after it was first conceived shaw mocks at the popular theories on war and love and combines a military satire with a taunt on love and family structure the play has flashing wit buoyant humor and bitter sarcasms a good example of shaws dialog is the statement by captain bluntschli to serguis i am a professional soldier i fight when i have to and am very glad to get out of it when i have not to you are only an amateur you think fighting is an amusement indeed as a swiss hotelkeepers son bluntschli had no reason to be involved in war and it is in this absurdity that shaw questions patriotic sentiments shaw explores the whole concept of war and the military from both sides of the struggle and in the end shows that the feelings in both camps are not that differentthe dialog and sarcasm used towards the common notions of life are entangled with a gentle assurance of the movement of the story towards a fairytale ending the end where all characters are rendered happy and lovers change and love shifts is what underlines the essence of this drama as a comedy this is a movie that sustains its image of possessing a universal appeal and is still appropriate today when the concepts of war and patriotism and love and marriage have changed dramatically shaws arms and the man should maintain its relevance as long as there is love and war,1
the opening sequence is supposed to show the legion arriving in paris on thirteen nov one thousand nine hundred and eighteen the troops pile off the train  wearing the uniform in which the french army including the legion marched off to war in one thousand nine hundred and fourteen this a sure sign that the war flick you are about to see will be a turkey the french army realized by one thousand nine hundred and fifteen that going to war in red trousers and dark blue overcoats was not working metropolitan french troops were put into horizon blue and colonial troops were put into khaki the claude vandamme sp remake at least got the uniforms more or less right really is too bad when directors make these sorts of mistakes when they then go to all the effort to get other things right,0
this miniseries is actually more entertaining than some others with much bigger budgets and grander aspirations sotd falls somewhere between kungfu and h r pufnstuff on the entertainment spectrum if it were not so long nearly three hours i think that kids would like it quite a bit it is got adventure action cliffhanger scenes and not too much romance or other icky stuff when you are young you are not too critical of flexing rubber swords campy acting and scenes that are repeated at least two scenes are repeated identically in the movie just as was done in oldtime serials in order to bring the audience up to speed finally kids are usually more accepting of american english dialogue coming out of the mouths of asian actors not to mention the fact that several of the leading roles are played by nonasian actors i was going to give this movie three stars but i felt like the director producers and cast deserved some extra credit for at least carrying through on the project this movie is not art but like painting your house it actually took some time effort and discipline to get it madeoverall not a recommended use for your time but it might keep the kids entertained while traveling in the minivanoh yeahhey imdb dialogue is the preferred and traditional spelling your spellchecking seems to think that dialog is the proper spelling while dialog is acceptable both websters and the oed consider it an alternative form,0
georgia rule has got to be one of  if not the worst movie i have ever seen in my life the whole movie has a very surreal feel that made me gasp what out loud at least seventen times throughout its grueling two hour courseadvertised in its trailer as a movie about three generations of women  jane fonda as the matriarch felicity huffman as her daughter and lindsay lohan as the rebellious over sexed scantily clad granddaughter the viewer thinks this will be a cliché light chickflick about growing up and coming together as a familytalk about false advertisement at it worstafter many shots of animals doing funny things in the background of pivotal scenes and not to mention a whole five minutes focusing on an old woman who comes into a doctors office weekly to have her diaper changed or the fact that this movie is actually about lindsay lohans character being sexually abused by her stepfather georgia rule creates its own genre of cinema  the ungrounded horribly acted inappropriate comedy dealing with extremely serious issues in the most awkward surreal strange way if garry marshall wanted this movie to be a dramacomedy then he should have watched the royal tenenbaums sideways junebug and so on and so onthe only way i feel i can get a reader to understand the horrific genre that georgia rule falls under is to create a hypothetical situation say that the movie the forty year old virgin was about the main character being celibate because he was sexually molested as a child but instead of having the movie take a more dramatic turn belly laughs and comedy would ensue with all of the characters reactions being that of fake lifeless human beings pretending to care throw in a yellow parakeet dermot mulroney as the flattest most nondimensional character that could have been cut completely out of this poorly written script along with a male character who throws away all of his religious beliefs and morals to be with a trashy tootanned girl who shares none of the same interests as he as well as an an unnecessary car chase scene unreal moments of characters trying to relate to each other and you have got georgia rulei found this movie to be an insult to any of those people out there who are struggling filmmakers screenwriters actors editors etcwho have a lot more talent and are not getting noticeddo not see this movie  my rule and if you must get sufficiently drunk before hand,0
i cheer for films that fill in subject matter gaps in world cinema so after watching the trailer for water lilies i expected to like this film because i thought i would stumbled on something unique a movie that honestly portrays teen lesbian love  sort of a female version of beautiful thing the main characters are young french women fifteen years old marie is slender reticent and pretty in a tomboyish way floriane is outgoing athletic and beautiful and anne is loyal pudgy and behaviorally immature the erotic interrelationship between marie and floriane is always simmering in this movie if not at the surface then just below it water lilies however is not about the dawning of lesbian love upon two teens it is about sexual frustration suffering ennui teens working at crosspurposes and  in at least two instances  joyless mechanical sex it also proves that screenwriters and filmmakers mar their own creations when they become too manipulativein the extra features on the lord of the flies dvd director peter brook says french cynicism starts with the arousal of sex meaning the french regard children as angels while they regard adolescents and adults with a pervasive cynicism part of the downfall of this film is filmmaker celine sciamma has gulped a mighty dose of this cynicismwhere is the joy i asked myself while watching this film yes first love can be painful and frustrating but it can also be joyful and triumphantly erotic in a fresh lifeaffirming way these positive aspects are missing from this movie there is no balanceorganically this movie wants to be a poignant celebration of first love but sciamma is too impressed with her own cynicism and cleverness and ruins the film first what is the point of showing only the plump girl nude i know there is an established tradition of tasteful teen nudity in european cinema as evidenced by films like the slingshot the rascals the devil probably the little thief murmur of the heart friends beau pere and europa europa but this instance is a petty authorial intrusion  see audience i can make a film where i show only the unattractive person nude either no nudity or evenly distributed nudity would have been an honest way to gothere is a scene in a club where floriane and marie are dancing what follows next is not just floriane cynically manipulating marie it is filmmaker sciamma cynically manipulating her audienceperhaps the biggest betrayal of authenticity and organic honesty takes place when floriane warns marie she is about to request something that is not normal marie understandably asks who cares about being normal then sciamma plays false with her audience and the hurtling momentum of the movie because florianes request is a phony derivative and substitute question  not the authentic heartfelt question the movie maries character and the viewers who have invested their time deserve here are also two moments which clank falsely on the viewers nerves one since when do the french  of all people  take baths wearing bathing suits and with a turtle to boot two what teen  of any nationality  would chomp down on an apple core that is been thrown in the garbage in order to get a taste of the beloveds mouththe three main actresses are promising and if they find better vehicles for their talents may become excellent actors louise blachere anne is the best actress in terms of technique and could have a successful career in supporting roles adele haenel floriane could become a leading lady or a bombshell or both pauline acquart marie possesses an intensity and magnetism which are unmistakable in the future she could play everything from an emotionally crippled librarian to a mysteriously sensual seductress to a reluctant politician riding a meteoric rise in acclaimall in all water lilies was very disappointing will an honest filmmaker please make an authentic movie about two young women falling in love no  not necessarily for the sake of this middleaged guy  but so young lesbian girls can have something of quality they can watch and identify with and yes to fill a subject matter gap in world cinema,0
this is not the video nastie but only because it came out in one thousand nine hundred and ninetyfour when they were presumably tired of the whole thing in britain it is seventyfive a rehash of the boogeyman and would have been banned for the same reason  whatever that wasi was initially confused as i thought that annie kelly galindo may have been a different lacey but she was someone trouble by psychic visions of a boogeyman similar to the one in the first film fans will immediately note that they are not the same personafter seeing a murder in a bathroom and also seeing the address as well annie her psychiatrist and a para psychology student who greatly resembles the guy on the cheap romance novels and butter commercials head to the house and sure enough it is the same bathroom twentyfour hours later a murder happens just as she described of course we have no idea who this boobilicious woman is or why she was murderedthen the movie shift to a rerunning of the boogeyman story with some extra footage that we did not see in the original notably the boogeyman is shown unlike the original sadly some of the good scenes were cut but ninety of it is there why rerun this film did they find the footage in the trash what was the purpose we will never know and despite the psychologist telling annie she is cured we all know the bogeyman will never die,0
say what you want about andy milligan  but if his family was even ten as deranged as the one in this film well then i guess he could have turned out worse unfortunately the video print of this film contains sex scene inserts originally shot by the distributor to boost the pictures box office appeal several times during the film milligans ugly camerawork and silent film music abruptly ends and suddenly goodlooking standins for milligans homely actors take over and start doing it to psychedelic sixtys guitar rock it is pretty easy to fastforward through if you are trying to pay attention to milligans original film which unfortunately is missing quite a bit of action that was cut to make room for the added sex scenes what remains however is still compelling stuff i do not think i have ever seen a more hateful mother in any film before,1
i cannot stand most reality shows and this one is worst than the one with paris hilton and sure it is his company but you are fired or you are hired for how many seasons now after watching the show i would not want to work for the guy with his ego and all and i think watching paint dry has more entertainment valvei would love to hear just one person get up and say donald i quit and take some of your money and buy a decent hairdo i see he is even trying to buy fame in the wrestling wwe i hope he gets hurt so i do not have to see his pathetic face anymore it must be sad to want fame so bad and have no talent and make an ass of yourself trying to buy it i would give this show a negative mark if i could but it gets a one and it does not deserve that,0
i think it is a nice movie i think it is a very romanian movie through scenery and atmoshpere i think it was not intended to be sensual sensuality is a result not a purpose i think it is very natural i think it is humane i think it was interesting i think the actors never made me think waw lame acting they are not sean connory  co neither is the film a block buster they are like the movie normal people that can act i think the movie reached its intention i think it made me feel things or feel them again   i think i am not objectivei really enjoyed it that i know,1
despite the english title this seems to have little to do with devils and much more to do with a power hungry ruler who seeks the philosphers stone  wants gold made from lead  virgins blood jacinto molina plays gilles de lancre and seems to have little issue with having people put to death when he thinks they threaten his position or when he needs virgins for their blood he is basically egged on by his lady love and an alchemist that he is employed and it is more greed and insanity that seems to be his problem than demonic possession unfortunately there are parts that are at least somewhat exciting like jousting and grown men trying to knock each other down with big sticks and the film at least has a good look to it but otherwise there is little about this to recommend little in the way of gore and nothing to be afraid of at all and most unusual for a molinanaschy film not really any unintentional humor therefore four out of ten,0
i did not have too much interest in watching the flockandrew lau codirected the masterpiece trilogy of infernal affairs but he had been fired from the flock and he had been replaced by an emergency director called niels muelleri had the feeling that lau had made a good film but it had not satisfied the studyso they fired him and hired another directorthis usually does not work well let us remember the invasionbut the flock resulted to be better than what i expectedit is not a great film but it is an interesting and entertaining thrillerthe character development is very well done and i could know the characters very wellalsothe relationship between the two main characters is natural and crediblerichard gere and claire danes bring competent performancesnowlet us go to the negative pointsone element which really bothered me there was a moment in which it irritated me was the excess of edition tricks to give the movie more attitude and stylethat tricks feel out of place and their presence is arbitraryplusi think the film should have been more ambitiousin spite of thati recommend the flock as a good thrillerit is not memorable at allbut it is entertaining,1
i cannot say that wargames the dead code is the worst movie i have ever seen as it had one or two decent moments but i can easily say it is the most transparent movie i have ever seen not once did a plot device present itself without me guessing it ten minutes in advance there was no subtlety to anything the movie did no intelligence evident at all behind the scenes every spoken or typed lines intent was so glaringly obvious it was impossible to get into the moviei found myself laughing at the horribly thought out plot line and the bumbled attempts to reclaim the audience far more often than i found myself enjoying the movie,0
contrary to some peoples summaries the women depicted in the film are not geisha they are oiran prostitutes living outside the most famous pleasure districts and their lives and experiences represent the lives of a great number of tokugawa era women i cannot say the stories were particularly enlightening but their charm lies in just how typical they are the themes are universal and everyday love friendship and sacrificei did greatly enjoy the art direction and the acting i felt like i was getting a glimpse of a time and place i can never otherwise glimpse the actors especially the four women who played the main oiran were a thrill to watch i would only recommend this movie to people who want a taste of japanese culture or to those who enjoy quiet and emotional stories it is a great example of both,1
when it comes to horror movies i am more than willing to suspend disbelief ignore subpar production values and overlook plot holes in the interest of a good scare this movies simply has no good scares to offer it cannot even be enjoyed as camp bad dialogue bad acting bad direction the kills were predictable and poorly staged the music was annoying the camera work was wretched even the costumes were bad i felt really bad for the actors who were obviously trying but who had to deal with terrible contrived dialogue and an obvious lack of direction i doubt they got any rehearsal either it is embarrassing to watch and so boring than making it through to the contrived surprise ending requires tremendous endurance it is quite easily one of the worst movies i have ever seeni do not normally write reviews but this one was so bad that i felt compelled to warn others this movie is a complete waste of time if you must watch this movie do not miss the making offeaturette the writerdirector seems to be under the impression that making the killer a woman was kind of bold daring move seen it he and the cast spend half an hour deconstructing this film as if it is a newage citizen kane it is like listening to a group of thirdgraders take you behind the scenes of their christmas pageant they truly think they have created something of substance it is sad really the only reason i gave this movie a two is because i think one should be reserved for true atrocities like manos hands of fate and space mutiny so american nightmare is not the worst movie i have ever seen but i would have to say that it is somewhere in the bottom fifty,0
does anyone happen to know where this film was shot the aviation scene on the cliff is beautiful it appears to be england however ivys apartment building certainly looks like the brill building with its fascinating elevatorscharles mendl is listed as playing sir charles gage maybe i blinked but i never saw him perhaps he was the husbands lawyer but again i do not recall that character being in the film other than being mentioned as having made a phone call perhaps he was in the aviation scene or the ballroom scene did anyone spot himherbert marshall was fiftyseven years old when he shot this film,1
the best part of an american in paris is the lengthy ballet sequence at the end where gene kelly and leslie caron are the living personification of several major painters kelly has earlier been established as a pavement artist in paris so the sequence is the logical ending to a musical bursting with life and energy gershwin tunes and cast members like georges guetary and oscar levant kelly was at his best here  it is a little different to singin in the rain and the effect of all the film as one topped with the ballet gives it a definite wow factor no wonder the sequence ended that is entertainment after all other mgm musical highlights had gone by,1
a thief in the night is a film that was generally ignored by movie fans at large due to its lowbudget which was obvious and its subject matterthe rapture of true christian church and the fate of those left behind nevertheless it was a gripping story that held the viewer and definitely made him or her review their relationship with jesus christ it touched everyoneshowing even a pastor who preached the word but did not believe it knowing exactly why he was left behind this movie and its sequel distant thunder are must see movies even with the new left behind series coming out telling the same story with a much higher budget the impact is still the samea thief in the night broke the ground of this genre and will always be remembered,1
in short this movie is completely worthlessthe idea is to make movie from the point of view of what someone from the early one thousand nine hundreds might think of the future an interesting idea but the lack of compelling story or characters prevents us from ever suspending our disbelief so the idea just flopsapparently the whole movie was done with actors in front of green screens and we are supposed to be impressed but as a graphics person the over softening was an obvious crutch for hiding the difficult sharp edge problem with green screening the color is majorly washed out to no relevant effect except reduce the visual quality and i do not understand why anyone would consider anything rendered in this movie to be in any way ground breaking if anything the ridiculous retrograde graphics have lowered the bar for really bad graphics  they do not measure up even to the ancient jurassic park graphics the models for the robots were so simple plain and very uncompelling there were a bunch of weirdo prehistoriclike animals on that island but they are not explained in any waythe story is horrible beyond belief in fact i cannot believe i did not just walk out of this movie the relationship between polly and joe is unmotivated and throughout the movie is based on distrust and deception why is the morris paley character even there we are not in any way convinced that joe is heroic  i mean he flies a plane and saved one person polly for personal reasons yeah there is a great hero for you dex has very little screen time so why are we supposed to care about joe wanting to save him who were the nepalease that locked joe and polly in the mine vault and why would they do it remembering that the entire totenkopf operation was roboticplot holes one why did bai lings character a major fall from her excellent character in the crow halt the robots who had captured joe they were looking for the vials and had not found them two why in the hell would dex be captured but not killed he does not have or know about the vials and the bad guys did not know that polly had the vials and was connected to joe and therefore to dex three polly indicates that they do not know anything about totenkopf yet she has some secret source about him that contains what appears to be a fairly complete fbistyle file on him four the blank spot on the map as described by the nepalese  if they know all about this mysterious area then why the hell is their map blank in that spot five at one point polly and joe have to give up their clothes they are burned  joe is given new clothes that were identical to his old clothes yet polly is forced to wear some very odd looking bulky dress then in the same line of continuity suddenly polly has her original clothes backsigh how far off am i supposed to switch my brain to watch this crapwe are supposed to be exhilarated by the over produced music even when nothing interesting or remotely exhilarating is happening on screenand the acting we are supposed to be impressed with a bunch of bad british accents which character is not annoying i think ling bais dialogue was probably the best in the whole movie she does not have a single line the dialogue was not camp and does not even rise to the level of cheese its just bad and annoying these people are not heros or compelling they are the kind of people you would try to ignore or disassociate with if you ever had the misfortune of meeting them in real lifei cannot believe that this movie gets an above average rating here on imdb imho it should be competing with batman forever in the bottom one hundred of all time,0
a one thousand nine hundred and fiftyseven yes that is the correct date j arthur rank production with james robertson justice margaret rutherford wilfred hyde white it has to be a smash comedy right oh it is just awful it is a one gag film watching people be shocked at the sight of a little alligator music is thrown in most inappropriately and forgettably jeannie carson is a lively dancer and competent singer but what was she doing in this film diana dors is here too providing ohsodaring shots for use in the previews her acting level is not bad but she is in the film to provide someone to leer at well one must do something beside groan during this film the movie is being sold on vhs now by people on ebay spare yourself the expense and the waste of time a comedy without a laugh a musical without a memorable song or dance,0
i have loved all of creams work even as there is such a small and precious catalog of work to take hold even when they go for as long as twenty minutes with some of their songs spoonful and toad off of wheels of fire are prime examples still rock the socks off of more than half of any given rock act working today this power to gel on stage is given one of the most anticipate rock band reunions ever with their royal albert hall shows last year they may have gotten older as have their fans but the energy is still there with the great arrangements of classic blues songs as well as their own the renditions of white room badge politician spoonful sunshine of your love not one seems to miss a beat claptons solos have a formation that he sometimes does not have when on stage with his solo band ginger baker enough said jack bruce is sturdy enough with his vocals still with a kind of power that clapton could never get on his own bottom line if you want to see what were the best shows you wish you had seen last year well some may have seen them it is all on this dvd with cool special features,1
the barbarians maybe´s not the best film that anybody of us have seen but reallyit´s so funnyi can´t discribe how mutch i laughed when i first saw itthe director really wanted to do a serious adventure movie but it´sso misirable badso bad that it´s one of the funniest movies i´ve ever seenso my advise is that you should see itand if you alredy did se it again,1
i had no idea what jane eyre was before i saw this miniseries i had read and watched many classics before and i believed that most classics were boring overworded and overrated stories with moderately interesting plots at best this jane eyre miniseries completely changed my conceptionszelah clarke is a fabulous actress and she gives a wonderful portrayal of jane eyre her accent is delightful and her quiet yet firm nature matches the young governess character exactly timothy dalton is an amazing rochester his passion and energy in the film makes me believe that he was born to play the brooding master of thornfield hall i could not sleep at all the night after i had watched this miniseries the plot is both haunting and inspiring the characters are masterfully performed and the story is incredible this is the best version of jane eyre to ever appear on filmi read the book later and was amazed at how closely this miniseries followed charolette brontes writing jane eyre is now my favorite film and book if you want to see a masterpiece that will change your life watch the one thousand nine hundred and eightythree bbc version of jane eyre,1
first this is a review of the two disc set that came together with the wonderland dvd rentalthe two movies included with the rental wonderland and the johnny wadd documentary totally obliterate the myth created by boogie nights that myth being that the characters involved in the adult movie trade were considerably more than slimy lowlifes that would do anything for money basically denying that they were anything other than detestable selfcentered whores this is amazingly similar to what the book wiseguy and the movie goodfellas did to the godfather fable and most of the rest of the gangster romanticism lorenow what irritated me most while watching these movies and will probably irk anyone who saw and liked boogie nights is how foolish and gullible supposedly educated and sophisticated people can be dirk diggler in boogie nights is without a doubt john holmes who unlike dirk diggler had no redeeming quality holmes was a criminal sociopath who abused anyone close to him was totally consumed by his quest for selfgratification and was without a doubt a key participant in the brutal murders on wonderland avenue in los angeles in one thousand nine hundred and eightyone the movie lays bare the big lie that boogie nights was and reinforces the linda lovelace description of the cruel and pathetic business that is known as the adult film entertainment industry this should be required viewing both features on the wonderland dvd for anyone who had any positive opinions on the story in the movie boogie nights,1
this is the kind of film that if it were made today it would probably star sandra bullock and hugh grant actually now that i think about it this one is quite liable to be remade one day it is pleasant but with no depth whatsoever it suffers from the almost fatal miscasting of james stewart in a role he is about twenty years too old for and as a result there is no chemistry between him and the beautiful kim novak ernie kovacs in the small supporting role of an aspiring writer is the only actor in the film whose performance approaches what you might call wit onetwo,1
the documentary presents an original theory about guns germs and steel the series graphically portray several episodes strongly supporting the theory and defend the theory against common criticismi was deeply puzzled to find user comments complaining about lack of new information in these series they say documentary presents information which is taught in middle school indeed it does in fact i greatly enjoyed the original look at the information which i have known since middle school and the unexpected analysisso if you like knowing why things work if you have taken apart the telephone trying to determine how it worked if you have gone to the farm to see how farm works and how cows are milked you will enjoy this series a definite recommendation,1
wow stacy peralta has followed up dogtown and zboys with an equally stunning documentary about the history of the bigwave surfing culture in america piecing together insider archival footage along with interviews from surfing legends we are transported into the daring and freespirited life of the early pioneers whose sheer passion for the sport spawned an industry that today touches the lives of millionsit is getting to know these icons and their stories that gives the film its warmth you can feel the respect peralta has for this group as we hear accounts of greg noll striding from a pack of awestruck fellow surfers on the beach to singularly challenge fiftyfoot swells off hawaiis north coast or jeff clark surfing the outrageously dangerous maverick off the northern california coast all alone for fifteen years before it was discovered and became the surfing destination in california and the storybook history of laird hamilton todays surfing icon hearing greg noll reverently refer to hamilton as the best surfer ever sent chills up my spineas an aside noll clark and others were at the sundance screenings noll humbly described himself as an old overthehill surfer he was deeply moved by the audience reception of him and film both he and clark were as likable in person as they were in the filmriding giants pays homage to these extraordinary athletes while at the same time rewarding us with an insight into the magnitude and terrifying power of the waves they seek to conquer the gutwrenching vertical drops required to get into them and the almost unfathomable combination of adrenaline and fear that the surfers experience each time they take on a monster swellall this and the movie has more for those of us that did not live in california in the sixtys we get an insight into the impact of surfing on american pop culture and to my surprise the impact of the movie gidget on surfing peralta also weaves in a primer on some of the technical aspects of the sport and the history of innovation in equipment i am not a surfer but like the rest of the sundance audience i was absolutely captivated by this film peralta is staking his claim as the big kahuna of american documentaries,1
the only good thing about people i know is that it serves as a perfect example of movies that al pacino should avoid performing in the first big turnoff i had was the way in which pacino tried to portray a georgia accent at times it was weak and unattractive while in other segments it seemed too overdone dialogue and character interaction was terrible along with a weak plot the supporting cast did an extremely perfunctory job in keeping the movie interesting and within an hour i still saw no signs of a sturdy plot the story overall is a real bore and i had to slap myself in the face a few times to keep myself awakethis movie will surely bore you as wellavoid at all costs,0
this movie should not be watched as it was meant to be a flop ram gopal verma first wanted to make this a remake of classic bollywood movie sholay but after having problems with the original makers decided to go ahead with the project and i guess leave all the good parts of the movie acting script songs music comedy action etc out and shoot the movie just because he already happen to hire the crew waste of money waste of time after making movies like rangeela satya and company he pulled a coppola godfather on us what were you thinking rgv anyways the story is though hard to follow is almost like the old sholay ajay devgan playing heero beeru sholay and ajay new kid on the block playing ajay jaysholay both bad yet funny friends help a cop capture a bad guy first later in the movie now retired cop hires them as personal security and safeguarding from the hands of a very most wanted bubban played by amitabh bachan in case you have not been watching bollywood movies the good guys win in the end there i just saved you three precious hours of your life,0
american playwright howard w campbell jr played with a musty obsolescence by nick nolte lives happily in germany with his actress wife helga noth sheryl lee before the beginning of world war ii at the peak of his life howard is drafted by an american agent john goodman to become a spy on behalf of the allies forewarned of the risks the job holds howard has everything to lose but finds the offer irresistible following the death of his wife and the end of the war campbell camouflages himself with the anonymity of a solitary life in new york city which muddies his neuroses even further the central question indeed a question that has frustrated many critics of the movie and kurt vonneguts source novel is is campbell a hero or a traitor director keith gordon and screenwriter robert b weide offer us clues but no answer and this ambiguitythis not knowingis what keeps mother night fresh and interesting throughout at the beginning of the film nolte portrays campbell as intelligent and confident by the end he is either scared and uncertain or scared and completely certain of his contributiondebt to humanity for the role he played in the war gordon applies a certain icy sheen to the images of the films first half which complement his portrait of the nazi bourgeoisie and captures vonneguts dramatic side on the flip side when campbell is confined to his lonely new york apartment which he affectionately calls purgatory only to be discovered by a group of nazis the humor produced also is purely distinctive of the author and provides a temporary respite from the dramatic tension that unfolds the moral even spiritual paradox mother night presents does not lend itself to simple resolution and to a degree should be left ambiguousthe blackandwhite scenes of campbell staring wearily into space as he is imprisoned in israel suggest an unspoken contemplation we are not made privy toas campbell is a character whose inner workings we wind up knowing very little about the war changes him coming back to america changes him and meeting up with the nazis in new york compels him to prolong the facade of his act even further to the point where he can only stare wearily at an image of himself projected on a wall spewing antisemitic bile perhaps that is the best reaction we could hope for,1
back in the one thousand nine hundred and seventys wpix ran the adventures of superman every weekday afternoon for quite a few years every once in a while we would get a treat when they would preempt neighboring shows to air superman and the mole men i always looked forward to those days watching it recently i was surprised at just how bad it really wasit was not bad because of the special effects or lack thereof true george reeves superman costume was pretty bad the edges of the foam padding used to make him look more imposing being plainly visible and true the mole mens costumes were even worse what was supposed to be a furry covering would not have fooled a ten yearold since the zippers sleeve hems and badly pilling fabric badly tailored into baggy costumes were all painfully obvious but these were forgivable shortcomingsno what made it bad were the contrived plot devices time and again superman failed to do anything to keep the situation from deteriorating a lynch mob is searching for the creatures rather than round up the hysterical crowd or search for the creatures himself he stands around explaining the dangers of the situation to lois and the pr man the creatures are cornered again he stands around watching and talking but does not save them until they are shot luke benson the towns rabblerouser shoots at him attempted murder to any reasonable person but superman releases the man over and over to cause more problems superman had quite a few opportunities to nip the problem in the bud but never once took advantage of themthat said both george reeves and phyllis coates played their characters well seemingly instantly comfortable in the roles if only they had been given a better script to work with,0
a chemical spill is turning people into zombies it is up to two doctors to survive the epidemic it is an andreas schnaas film so you know what the par for the course will be bad acting horribly awful special effects and no budget to speak of the dubbing is ridiculous with a capital r and the saddest thing is that i feel compelled to write one word about this piece of excrement much less the ten lines mandatory because of the guidelines placed on me by imdb my original review of merely one word crap would not fly so i have to revise it and go more in to how bad it is but i do not know if i can so wait i think i may have enough words or lines rather to make this review pass which is cool i guess so in summation this movie sucks balls do not watch itmy grade f,0
this movie is a rewrite of the one thousand nine hundred and seventyeight warren beatty movie heaven can wait but it is written for the standup comedic style of mr rock the premise remains the same lance barton rock is taken before his life time is up and works a deal with gods representative mr king to come back to earth as someone else as in beattys movie he chooses the murdered charles wellington a rich white man all because he fancies sontee jenkins regina king who happens to turn up at wellingtons house during the murder the role of mrs wellington and her lover suffers in this remake and the idea to turn an aged white multimillionaire into a stand up black comedian who tries to woo sontee simply does not work also the intercuts used to show rock as wellington and then as the real white wellington fail miserably improvements could have been made to the original beatty plot  which in itself did not masterfully portray the lifeafterdeath idea  but they certainly were not to be found in down to earth,0
i love the book jane eyre and have seen many versions of it all have their strong points and their faults however this was one of the worst i have seen i did not care about jane or mr rochester charlotte gainsbourg jane was almost tolerable and certainly looked the plain part but she had no emotion in any of her lines i could not imagine what mr rochester saw in her that brings us to mr rochester william hurt had even less emotion than jane if that were possible how two such insipid people could fall in love is a mystery but it certainly did not hold my attention perhaps the director zeffrelli fell asleep during the productionthe timothy dalton too handsome for mr rochester version is far more faithful to the book but ciaran hinds plays the perfect mr rochester in the one thousand nine hundred and ninetyseven ae version which is not all that true to the booktrying to find something positive about this movie geraldine chaplain was perfect in her role,0
what a terrible movie rotten tomatoes had a good rating for this too do not be fooled by the positive comments it was not scary it was not funny it was not clever it will not even hold your attention i just wasted two hours of my life viewing this crapfest the computer generated monster was interesting to see the first couple times after about fifteen minutes it no longer entertained the dialogue was terrible must be a translation thing another negative that stood out was the idiot americans three were portrayed and they were all lacking character intelligence and judgment now i will write a couple of lines to pad this since we have to have ten the employees at the video store should have slapped me for bringing this title to the counter,0
having been pleasantly surprised by sandra bullocks performance in miss congeniality i decided to give murder by numbers a shot while decent in plucky selfeffacing roles ms bullocks performance in serious roles see hope floats speed two twentyeight days leave much to be desired her character is at the same time omniscient confused and sexually maladjusted the subplot of sandras past comes across as needless filler that does little to develop her already shallow character the two teenage boys gave decent performances although their forensics expertise and catchmeifcan attitude is belied by stupid errors that scream we did it chris penn as the alltooobvious suspect is wasted here as is ben chaplins token partnerlove interest characterspoilers ahead mediocre acting aside the biggest flaws can be traced to a tvoftheweek plot that never has you totally buying into the murder motives in the first place and as mentioned the stupid errors vomiting up a rare food on the murder scene an all too convenient and framing of the school janitor the two boys hanging out together in public a convenient love interest to cause friction etc etc because the view to go from being intrigues to being bored and disappointed by the murderers the ending was strictly by the numbers and was probably the most disappointing aspect of the movie using the nowcliched tactic of almost showing the climactic scene at the beginning of the film and then filling the audience in how we arrived at that moment the final scenes surprise no one and lacked any of the socalled intelligence the film purported to arrive at it is conclusion a somewhat promising concept but poorly executed and weak in nearly every way  out of ,0
the funny sound that you may hear when you eyeball this execrable version of jules vernes classic journey to the center of the earth is verne spinning in his grave the only thing about this eighty minute opus that has anything to do with journey to the center of the earth is the title otherwise everything else in this lackluster production is new and not worth watching in fact the director has written here at imdbcom that he directed only eight minutes of journey to the center of the earth and the studio tacked on part of dollman helmer albert pyuns sequel to his own alien from la with kathy ireland evidently the producers ran out of money and to satisfy overseas contractual obligations they grafted pyuns sequel onto director rusty lemorandes movie please do not rent or buy this wretched piece of garbageunlike director henry levins period piece journey to the center of the earth one thousand nine hundred and fiftynine with james mason and pat boone lemorandes journey to the center of the earth takes place in contemporary times in hawaii two fellows a british nanny and a dog are brought together for the adventure of a lifetime purely by coincidence richard paul carafotes of blind date and his comic book obsessed brother bryan ilan mitchellsmith of weird science are going out to explore a cave the heroine crystina nicola cowper of underworld works for a domestic service called nannies r us being a nanny has been crystinas lifelong dream but she has made a less of all five of her nanny jobs nevertheless her sympathetic supervisor ms ferry lynda marshall of africa express sends her to hawaii crystinas new client rock star billy foul jeremy crutchley of doomsday who is scheduling one last concert to revive his flagging career has a dog named bernard foul wants crystina to take bernard to a doggie day spa crystina is waiting on the arrival of her taxi when a careless motel attendant accidentally puts the basket that conceals bernard in richards jeep you see foul has hidden his canine in a basket because motel management strictly prohibits pets on their premises foul has disguised the dog as a human baby anyway crystina catches a cab and tells the driver follow richardafter she catches up with them to get her dog the cabbie cruises away and abandons her crystina demands that richard drive her back to town but he has other plans unhappily crystina joins the guys and they get lost and then find themselves in the lost city of atlantis a police state ruled by a dictator at the center of the earth the rulers of atlantis repeatedly notify their citizens that life on the surface does not exist our heroes and heroine stumble onto atlantis quite by accident atlantis resembles a disco and everybody looks like they are straight out of a punk rock opera the ruler of atlantis general rykov janet du plessis of operation hit squad is orchestrating a raid on the surface with clones of the first human wanda saknussemm kathy ireland of necessary roughness to visit atlantis predictably general rykov machinations to rule atlantis and overthrow the earth fails and our heroes and heroine save the dayjourney to the center of the earth is an abomination the movie seems to be a comedy despite its superficial satire about dictatorships albert pyun is one of my favorite low budget action directors but he blew it on this lightweight shambles of a science fiction saga,0
i actually really like what i have seen of this cartoon so far sure the animation is not the best but frankly i would rather see this type of more cartoony style done quickly and cheaply than the old type of style done quickly and cheaply which was starting to happen more and more oftenit is only a style that looks good when a lot of time and effort is put into it there is nothing wrong with the angular lines and the little blackdot eyesin fact i think it is really cute as a kid i never thought scoobydoos design was particularly adorable but i think i might like it better knowanyway shaggy has always been my favorite character and believe it or not but i think he has the most potential for some depth sure the show does not center around the original mysterysolving theme but that was just a tired old formula anyway do not get me wrongi am sure there are writers out there who would be able to bring a lot more interest to mystery incs traditional pursuits which has been lacking as late but in the mean time this show is a fun deviation from the standard shaggy and scooby are still funny but no longer only comic relief they are still cowardly but finally have the opportunity to use what seems to be shock intelligence they are the same old overeating slackers as ever but now actually seem to be getting on with their lives with the help of uncle alberts inheritancei used to find most original scoobydoo jokes to be pure cheese and unintentionally hilarious at best but this show actually exercises a capacity for real humor also i never really like casey kasem as shaggy anyway so the new actor does not annoy me as much as he does other people i still think billy west was the best thoughoverall while not a great cartoon in the scope of all of cartoon history still an achievement among other scooby incarnations,1
normally i am not motivated to write reviews but this movie was so excruciatingly painful i feel i must i cringed at the appallingly predictable plot the lame acting and laughed at moments which were supposed to be tense indeed most of the audience seemed pretty bored and chatty even at the most tense moment of the movie molly ringwald stood out as the only performance of any merit in a tortured production even the twist at the end was not i have heard it said that the movie did not take itself seriously but i could find little evidence of that in the moviecut should have been left on the cutting room floor do yourself a favour and spend your time and money on something else,0
i have been familiar with the fantastic book of goodnight mister tom for absolutely ages and it was only recently when i got the chance to watch this adaption of it i have heard lots of positive remarks about this so i had high hopes once this film had finished i was horrifiedthis film is not a good film at all goodnight mister tom was an extremely poor adaption and practically fourfiveten of the book was missed out particularly i found that a lot of the characters and some great scenes in the book were not in this there was not much dialogue it was rushed and far too fastmoving but i was mostly upset by the fact that you never got to see the bonding and love between william beech and tom in this film which was a true let down the casting was not all that goodeither i thought this could have been really good but it was so different to the book anextremely poor adaption one of the worst i have seen this deserves a decent remake that would better be one thousand times better than this pile of garbage,0
very few chess movies have been made over the last couple of years but this one is more than just a chess movie its a story about the need to be loved and the need to win itjohn toturro plays a psychologically challenged man nothing matters to him accept sixtyfour squares and thirtytwo pieces the game validates him as a person when he looses a game he looses the one thing that makes sense to him and john torturro expresses this in a beautiful fashioneven the love of a woman was not enough to save him from his sad existenceit makes you wonder if there other luzons out there who obsess about the gamei am sure they areif you are a chess enthusiast it will not hurt to watch itits an intelligent piece of work laid out properly and executed wellit achieves its objectivesunfortunately i doubt if there will be sequel,1
as with all the other reviewers this movie has been a constant in my mind after thirty years i recall going to the library researching all that i could on this story i even wrote to the pbs station for more information despite all this all i was able to find out was that it was a story printed in a newspaper in the early part of the one thousand nine hundredsfastward to two thousand and two after years of searching ebay for on a weekly basis and there it was a vhs copy of the movie there was one other bidder but i was determined to win this movie the losing bidder wrote me asking for a copy which i gave her despite owning a copy i still searched and searched finally finding a site that sold a dvd copy of the movie you can find it at ,1
everyone we meet influences our thinking modifies our ways a little bit of that person rubs off onto us the eighth day takes up this theme compare rainmaker in this film harry daniel auteuil a businessman expert in sales psychology meets up with georges pascal duquenne a downs syndrome child on the run winning performances from both these actors give this film its main strength the opening sequence is excellent where georges relates his theory on the creation of the world and in the closing scene we discover what god created on the eighth day there are some moments in the story that are very frustrating for harry for example georges who is completely uninhibited demands a pair of expensive shoes and has not enough money it is the kind of scene where you laugh through your tears i liked the scene where the downs syndrome group on a trip to the art gallery escape on a bus and gatecrash the paradis fun park the most humorous of all the embarrassments is the scene where harry and georges pass a horsefloat on the highway and looking back georges gives the driver a rude salute but there are some gentle scenes as well especially the impressive use of closeups of hands  hands feeling the sunwind and rain hands reaching up hands reaching out and clasping in love and friendship this is true cinema which touches the heart there are very moving scenes where georges proposes to nathalie where georges cradles harrys head in his arms where georges keeps calling for his dear mom where georges teaches harry to laughi felt there was a profound message in the film that life is beautiful the very presence of grass did you know it cries when you cut it the trees overhead the song of birds the little insects  all natures miraculous creatures they are all there to be enjoyed if we but lie back like harry and georges look around us and listena beautiful film,1
first this deserves about five stars due to acting some which would give me a better subjective opinion and not an objective one as it should by giving this one well deserved star but then i know that those facts are used for the actors names to increase the rating of something like thisi do have a problem with such productions yet another attempt just like untraceable of a systematic propagandistic feature promoting government intrusion on your rights how interesting that it comes at a moment when ips providers trying to preferentiate  censor information and the americans and canadians are fighting against that at this very moments this time is not by labeling torrent file transfers as evil  that one was intended to remind you of such feeling whenever you transfer data on the net but by literally attempting in creating a sexual frustrated population as a whole seems like fear promotion is hollywoods norm this days especially when coming to thrillers which is the most on demand motion picture genre for past two decades or so  most viewed best way to try influence the society as a whole such levels of violence are depicted in this two features of morally and ethical people that it gives a new much needed meaning to antiheroes figures make no mistake  this is not dexter which was meant to be highquality entertainmentstop selling fear please the world would be a better place without it and the dollars made of itthe opening scene and generally the first ten minutes really give a frightful picture of an erroll babbage that is clearlly suffering of sexual frustration the way he handles the black male is very disturbing if not outright racistfor sure a cliche at least  in real life someone would probably get a beating for it you will see what i mean the second scene  with claire daness character present is even more extreme at that point i realized in my opinion that erroll babbage is a very dangerous individual to people around himhow many people that have seen or will see this movie have never been hold downregarding both sexes out of self common gratificationtypically the movie gives an extreme criminal casethat unfortunately did is and will likely happen again sometime  somewhere but fingers everyone else indirectly as well as you could become that etc anyone that is familiar with sigmund freud and jung will know very well that sexuality is not something to be judged let alone asses  by such fanatical hero here safe sex in its many forms is healthy and not some evil that apparently richard gere character is obsessed with  on his way for some sexual crusade have we not learned anything from the abundant recent scandals involving priests and young boys or for how long an american teenager can see extreme violence on pgthirteen but he can not even see a woman breast until reighteen yet the industry targets them with this very same sexual perversions like american pie series for exampleraise the kids testerone levels but frustrate them and drive them underground in developing fetishes to unhealthy extremes all sexual activitiesupon mutual acceptance integrates individuals better then some rightous nutcase that blames his misfortunes and shortcomings on the lives of others a new german movie that would work great in comparing this two distinct and world apart features on the very same subjecthere like in that movie you will probably appreciate the actors for well portraying the opposite of what they should have beeni am very disappointed with richard gere especially after the recent  hunting party a feature where he really shines and about a more realistic hero after real facts as wellbut then it just reminds me that all those people are only actors that get paid to play someone is political and social agenda the flock and untraceable two heads of the same hidden beastit just reminds you if know anyone with similar views on the subject as a whole as erroll babbage has those here to stay clear of them for their own safetythey would kill my family faster then any zeroone chances of paul jerrod in anyones life wouldin the end i recommend this to anyone thinking negative here about my assesment of this particular movie  and untraceable actually so you can likely have similar thoughts as i did nothing sweeter then a propagandistic movie shooting itself in the footfor once i agree with the rating this is not a feature for teenagers or kids simply because at best would confuse them even more then the common belief of moneyfamefashion and how that relates to sexuality scream series and movies as such at least have a defined entertainment valueeven if a dumb one in my opinion but this one is just another trust me i know what is good for you deeply not so well done i might add subliminal messages,0
all of those who voted less than five are obviously not fans of clean tongueincheek humor keaton is brilliant in this  as in most of his work this is not a blockbuster biggerthanlife affair this is campy slapstick humor played out by some of hollywoods best and very versatile actors piscopo was equally on the mark as the top dog wannabee onceif you want to see the funniest attempt at not really cussing ever filmed you got to see dimitri do his piece as moronei gave it a seven,1
i saw this movie at the toronto film festival with fairly solid expectations the movie has a great cast and was closing at the festival so it must be good right how wrong i was i knew we were in trouble when before the film the director was talking about how when he was directing an episode of wiseguy he met an unknown actor named kevin spacey a directorwriter of wiseguy making his feature debut  blah well the directorwriter of edison must have some incriminating pictures of kevin spacey killing a homeless man because i cannot see how he along with the other actors in the film would ever agree to be in this disaster this movie is absolutely appalling it is a mixture of every cop hard boiled cliché ever there is nothing new with edison the acting was bad and the direction was even worse it looked like that aforementioned episode of wiseguy this was the best casted direct to video movie i have ever seen some examples of just bad silly moments in edison morgan freeman dancing around his apartment for no reason to rock and roll music justin timberlake getting creative criticism from his belle while his apartment is surrounded by candles llcoolj driving a vintage firebird three guys being shot in the headthis movie is the opposite of goodstay away from edison,0
with the exception of about ten sublime minutes with hb warner on the celestial train this was ninetyfour minutes of jawdropping horribleness the acting was atrocious but the story is what i really found appalling the acting was wooden and stilted even by early talkies standards the exceptions being lee tracy and hb warner neither of whom can do wrong rose hobart was absolutely horrid and lifeless as julie as she likewise was in one thousand nine hundred and thirtytwos dr jekyll and mr hyde an otherwise excellent flick and the rest of the cast was worse there being no words to describe their awfulness worse than the acting however was the story for some unknown reason julie loves liliom a cad and user of women with no redeeming qualities whatsoever he marries julie but does not support her instead lying in bed all day or hanging out with his lowlife criminal pal lee tracy and oh yeah he never has a kind word to say to julie and he regularly beats her julie loves him nonetheless and continually makes excuses for him which only seems to make him more abusive what is even sicker is that this movie presents this story to us as a love story somehow we are supposed to see julie as a noble character whose pure love redeems liliom wtf the last onethree of this movie takes place after liliom has killed himself a robbery plot goes awry and liliom plunges a knife into himself rather than being taken in by the police as he lay dying he tells julie i beat you all the time but i am not sorry for it when he at last dies she finally tells him she loves him neither character ever said i love you to the other while they were alive after his death gods chief magistrate gives liliom one more day on earth so that he can do something good for his unborn daughter the price for this is ten years in hell after ten years liliom is allowed one day on earth to see his now tenyrold daughter he approaches her in the front yard of her home and tries to cajole her into letting him do something good for her he tries to get her to play cards he tries to give her gabriels horn but she is not interested and rebuffs him so he slaps her he slaps her and then he disappears back to the afterlife looking on we see his daughter tell julie about this the girl says the slap did not hurt that it felt like a kiss this is supposed to be the movies magical moment the girl asks her mother if such a thing is possible and julie replies that someone can be beat you and beat you and beat you and not hurt you at all then the music swells and liliom rides up to heaven in the celestial train blech there was one saving grace to this film and that is the interview between the chief magistrate hb warner was truly magnificent here and liliom on the celestial train the magistrate had some very profound things to say to liliom about life and second chances and death this scene alone made me bump this rating from one to two stars regarding lilioms suicide as a means for escaping his problems the magistrate says people suppose that when they die their difficulties are ended for them you thought that by killing yourself that you would cancel all your responsibilities it is not as simple as that on earth your name is still spoken your face is still remembered as long as one is left who remembers you so long is the matter unended until you have been completely forgotten you will not be finished with the earth even though you are dead some great sublime transcendental stuff amongst some of the most horrible trash i have ever seen by the way this story has apparently been filmed many times both as liliom and as the musical carousel,0
to me a matter of life and death is just that simply the best film ever madefrom beginning to end it oozes class it is stimulating thought provoking a mirror to the post war world and the relations between peoplesthe cinematography is simply stunning and the effect of mixing monochrome and technicolour to accent the different worlds works seamlessly the characters and plot development are near perfect and the attention to detail promotes a thoroughly believable fantasyno matter how many times i watch the film  and i have watched it a lot  it never fails to touch me it makes me smile it makes me laugh it makes me think it makes me cry it is as fresh today as it was in one thousand nine hundred and fortysixif i were allowed just one film to keep and watch again a matter of life and death would be that film,1
this is amazinglooking movie with the whole thing done in just six or seven colors when it came out over fifteen years ago it stunned audiences with its color scheme being so different from anything else that had ever been put on film those colors for me at least make this an absolutely fascinating film to watch there are literally thousands of scenes i wish could freeze and somehow convert them to a painting to study for their artworkthe characters and the story do not match up to the greatness of the photography but they are all overthetop especially the villains the famous actors who played them here must have a had a lot of fun on the set playing flatop pruneface lips mumbles etcmeanwhile warren beatty and gleanne hedley are good as dick tracey and girlfriend tess truehart and she is as sweet and soft as her name another good addition is charlie korsmo as the delinquent young boy dick and tess take under their wing the colorful other characters are played by al pacino dustin hoffman william forysthe paul sorvino mandy patinkin madona and other names you know but are too numerous to list here check the full credits on the main page and you will amazedthe only negatives i found were pacinos voice which grates on you after awhile madonnas offkey singing voice and the fact that the film would have been better trimmed about ten minutes those faults are all minor because overall this is a fun moviea cartoon strip coming to life in an incrediblycolorful fashionlike nothing you have ever seen,1
anything that might have been potentially interesting in this material is sunk in the first few seconds with a disclaimer that the events we are about to see cannot ever be known and this is the whisper rumor most often told about one of hollywoods most sensational mysteriesokay so we are not getting anything new and es mysteries  scandals gives you a better foothold on the particular incidentand that is not much of an endorsement what do we getwe learn that hollywood is a nest of vipers and decadents no big news there more interesting we learn what a washed up director is willing to do to regain his position of power in the entertainment industry andor political establishment it raises the question of whether peter bogdanovich is speaking from his own experience through these characters but what is told is so cynical and ugly and muddled we are left feeling guilty for witnessing a bunch of hooey that passes itself off as historythe tone of the film has a curious madcap quality that i found more irritating than fun we are not empathetic with anyone and the great citizen kane polishes off the relationship between davies and hearts in a much more convincing way in the cats meow we are not ever sure of davies motives for being with hearst as soon as we are told one thing she is off doing the otherand are we to believe that davies was the love of chaplains life or is he just trying to cockold one of americas most powerfuland apparently moroniccitizens the film never makes it clearwhat is convincing are the production values there is a glorious recreation of the yacht and period costumes i got more out of looking at the construction of some of the lapels on the mens jackets than following a story that libels many of the the most wellknown personalities in hollywood history no one will remember that the screenplay is pure fiction the disclaimers that frame the film only make it all the more tentative and unsatisfyingthe performers cannot be faulted although meg tilly goes way past parody here kirsten dunst never disappoints she gives the most sincere performance in a sea of scenery chewing only joanna lumley rises above the material but so much so that she seems to be distancing herself from the whole enterprise rather than narrating it one of her first lines is i am not here and i am sure she wishes she was notthis is not on par with bogdanovichs trashy sobadit isgood at long last love it is perched on attempting something serious but hesitates and stumbles chiefly because it is so full of bitterness towards the beast named hollywood this is national enquirer filmmaking and it not only soils the names of those who the film places on board the oneida that weekend but the audience gets pretty dirty as well,0
if you have any kind of heart and compassion for people this is a tough movie to watch at least in the second half of it it is in that segment where we see nice little kid get beaten up and then a retarded mentally challenged man go off the deep end after he witnesses this brutal act against the child it is not pleasant materialhowever it is a good movie and the acting is good too the story will sit with you awhiledominick is the mentallydisabled guy and is played by tom hulce i think this might be hulces best role ever he is looked after by a med student eugene played by ray liotta who became a star the following year with kevin costners field of dreamsdominick is a goodhearted garbage man who reads hulk comic books and loves wrestling he is the type of slow guy that you cannot help but love and root for to live a happy life when he freaks out it is for several good reasons andwell see the film for the whole story it is worth your time but be prepared to go on real emotional roller coaster and possibly be very upset at some things you see,1
this is unlike any other movie the closest thing i can compare it to is a woody allen film but where as woody allen is constantly fathoming human foibles bret carr appears to be trying to figure out a way to get to grips with that one crippling insecurity that tends to define us for better or worse in the case of lou it is the root because of his stuttering which can be traced back to a singular child hood trauma that is revealed through flash backsthere are so many strangely neurotic people in the world and i believe they all deserve a chance for redemption although diversity of human character is after all what makes the world such an intriguing place so maybe we should not fix our neurosis anymore than we should fix our noses or breaststhis is an indie film shot on a long shoestring but the production values are tremendous as is the scope of the film i feel like its a quirky gem for the selfhelp market i really look forward to seeing what this filmmaker does next i could imagine a career along the lines of woody allen or albert brooks although usually when a guy like this breaks through he goes off and makes  x men and his humble quirky origins are soon forgotten or are they x men is aout a bunch of freaks if i remember correctly ,1
this is absolutely one of the best movies i have ever seen it takes me on a a rollercoaster of emotions i laugh and cry and get disgusted and happy and in love all this in a little over two hours of time the actors are all brilliant i have to mention the leading actor of course michael nyquist he does a remarkable job i also admire the actor who plays tore who plays this mentallychallenged young man in such a convincing way he sort of reminded me of leonardo di caprios roll in gilbert grape and then there is the most beautiful song in the world gabriellas sångi recommend this for everyone to see and enjoy,1
this particular joe mcdoakes short subject was obviously inspired by the all star warner brothers spectacular thank your lucky stars one of those all star wartime morale boosters of the period in that one eddie cantor played both himself and a would be comedian who would like to break into films except for his resemblance to cantorgeorge ohanlon who starred in the mcdoakes shorts is both himself and mcdoakes who is just trying to get a break in film like thank your lucky stars a few warner brothers contract players with a free moment strolled through this filmohanlons been sent by central casting for a small one line role in a world war i film but lookalike mcdoakes gets the message the poor guy is so nervous about his big moment he starts thinking of ways to deliver his one line maybe sounding like a real movie star would helpeightysix takes later to the exasperation of director ralph sanford and the patient clyde cook who plays a british cockney soldier they do find a niche in the film business for poor mcdoakes it is worth seeing this very funny short subject which was nominated for an oscar to find out what happens to ohanlonmcdoakesboth of them,1
this was an atrocious waste of my time no plot the acting was so far below par it should be used as an exemplar in acting classes of what not to do it is merely a commercial ripoff of the earlier universal soldier which also scrapes the bottom of the acting barrel its sad that vd needs to assert his ego every few years and sadder still that people will pay good money to sit thru it this kind of schlock gives martial arts movies a bad name by comparison it makes segall norris and arnold look almost talentedperhaps vd should take the leslie nielson track and do sendups of his genre at least then we could be laughing with him instead of at him,0
the directing behind this film was fantastic for a comedy many of the scenes appear to be out of a comic book and much darker visually  not story wise than what i expected granted this may not be the funniest movie ever made especially if you are into very crude sexist jokes as this has very little of that compared to others like something about mary or american pie as you rewatch it several jokes stand out and get funnier if you have ever read a comic book or watched a comic booktype movie batman xmen etc and liked them you will probably enjoy the subtle humor that continues throughout the movie if you did not like them you may like the respectful ridicule that this film has for those if you did like this movie the dvd has some cool extras eightten,1
as a kid i did think the weapon the murderer wielded was cool however i was a kid and so i was a bit dumb even as a dumb kid though the movies plot was stupid and a bit boring when the killer was not using his light knife to kill people what amazes me is that the movie has a really solid cast in it what script did they read when agreeing to be in this movie as it is most assuredly boring and only a means to show off a light saber on a very small scale the plot at times is incomprehensible and the end is totally chaotic the whole film seems to rotate around aliens and the one weapon the plot has two kids and some dude having an alien encounter flash years later and there seems to be a return as it were in the mix dead animals and such to be explored and for some reason the one dude gets the weapon of the aliens and proceeds to use it to go on a very light killing spree seriously you just have to wonder why this movie was made if you are going to have a killer have some good death scenes if you are going to have alien encounters show more than a weird light vortex thing and if you are going to have light sabers then call yourself star wars,0
dolph lundgren broods and scowls his way through this incoherent mysterythriller that is not nearly as cool as the box would have you believe he is actually quite good here but the story is a mess of bmovie cliches detectives revenge tycoons hookers sm that looks like it was made up as they went along the film picks up a bit in the second half but for a more decent lundgren flick rent red scorpion instead,0
the movie was excellent save for some of the scenes with esposito i enjoyed how it brought together every detective on the series and wrapped up some plotlines that were never resolved during the series thanks to nbc it was great to see pembleton and bayliss together at their most human and most basic persons braugher and secor did a great job but as usual will get overlooked it hurt to see that this was the end of homicide memories tapes and reruns on courttv just are not the same as watching it come on every friday but the movie did its job and did it very well presenting a great depiction of life after al retired and the family relationship that existed between the unit i enjoyed this a lot,1
creep is a straight up serious horror film set in real time that wants nothing more than to just show people get attacked in a empty subway platform by a mutant for eightyfive minutes and it does just that nothing more nothing less director christopher smith draws out the drama a far as he plausibly can by introducing a series of characters that would actually have a reason to be in the subway after it is locked he also leaves the origins of the titular creep deliberately vague unlawful experiments happening in the sixtys underground are hinted at and that little bit of mystery works for the most part sadly he undermines himself toward the end by actually holding back from a twist ending where more genetic malformations would appear they are hinted at as well yes you heard me right  i wanted a clichéd twist ending franka run lola run potente is good as the terrorized female lead and the rest of the cast is fine,1
wow why would anybody make a sequel to an already rancid film half past dead was a bad movie but at least at had an idea of what it wanted to be hpdtwo has no clue of what it wants to be it just exists on screen for reasons i cannot explain spoiler the whole movie is this twitchplayed by kurupt of tha dogg pound gets transferred to another jail where there might be a box filled with gold bricks buried in the jail a riot breaks out between rival inmates one of them gets shot by a guy named cortez and cortez plans his escape during a conjugal visit twitchs fiancée and burkesplayed by bill goldbergdaughter get kidnapped by cortez and are held in an execution room burke reluctantly befriends twitch and they end up getting into trouble with the idiotic inmates while finding out that cortez has their loved onesopinion this is the most unnecessary sequel since universal soldier the return the script is terrible the acting is horrendous the dialog is a joke and everybody in this movie is a caricature look i know it was low budget film but that is not an excuse for these guys to not put effort into what they do nobody in this movie believes in the characters they play nobody in this movie can be taken seriously as an actor kurupt should be ashamed of himself his character twitch is pretty much a spineless minstrel puppet who spends most of his time posing while getting jacked up by burke or the other inmates bill goldberg spends most of his time sulking throughout the movie as if he had to take a phdpretty huge dump the fight scenes are poorly choreographed and pathetic and for an action movie hpdtwo is pretty boring even when action is happening do not let anybody tell you that this movie is somewhat decent it stinks and is a prime reason why people despise follywood,0
this is a very odd film  i was not really sure what is was about some n london lowlifes find a mute kid in the woods that they all believe is some kind of oracle and somehow makes them all in their own way change something about their lives that usually ends in disaster the film ended after about ninety minutes leaving me feeling quite unsatisfied almost annoyed at the pointlessness of it all i did not care about any of the characters  none of them get a chance to endear themselves to the viewerwhat was the message am i being dim it was just too odd what happens to runner why does emilio shoot the kid  that made absolutely no sense pointless can someone help me understand this mess of a film,0
so where are the cannibals those intrigued by the title and the real cannibal appeal of this film will be let down instead we are shown a strange man and his revisiting of a papua new guinea village full of natives one of whom was his lover several decades prior the man tobias schneebaum is new york jewish as they come and somehow this is intertwined with the documentary as he appears in his yamika in several scenesthere are no real cannibals here only stories relayed by some of the natives and by tobias himself not all together a bad film very interesting and great cinematography schneebaum remains highly likable throughout and provides us with a fascinating glimpse into a life that is about as far removed from western civilization as one can getit is just not what it claims to be on the cover and in the plot summaryfour out of ten kids,0
i am not particularly fond of remakes or to steal the modern jargon retellings but this film truly peeved me off the original prom night while not in my humble estimation a masterpiece still realized what it was horror there are some simple things to remember when making a horror film suspense is crucial to maintaining the interest of the audience sorry folks but a white knuckle film this was not the scares were cheap and foreshadowed terribly a good example of scare which has been done to clichéd excess now is the cat jumping out of the closet followed soon there after but a now unexpected appearance by the villain of the film this film could not successfully pull that off so how could i expect it to fulfill any of the other conventions of horror film there needs to be a likable hero or heroine this film does not have one the person i most identified with was the head detective his calm demeanor but level headed approach to the escape of a killer was what more films of this ilk should have common sense approach to events that occur if you are running from an axe wielding psycho you turn and sprint in the opposite direction not jog whilst looking back ever three seconds gaging the killers progress only to trip over every branch and inanimate object in your path if you friend disappears you do not go looking for them alone and if you suspect foul play you tell someone not investigate yourself these clichés are tired and well overplayed in the horror genre in general and in this film in particular,0
viggo mortensen stars as a new inmate of a haunted prison in which the warden played well by lane smith has a grisly secret that could be the reason why various prison guards and inmates are being slaughtered by a supernatural presence lincoln kilpatrick is the lifer who knows the secret and is scared for his life when i think prison movies i always think action movies starring stallone or van damme or high caliber dramas such as shawshank redemption or the green mile however i did not expect a ghost story more along the lines of exorcist iii prison however is an atmospheric effort and it certainly remains the best movie of renny harlins career the movie is creepy and has some good acting from a cast of at the time unknowns lane smith comes off the best because his warden is not the usual cliché of evil personified but rather nervous and twitchy which adds some credibility to a movie that far exceeds expectations out of fourgood,1
what a real treat and quite unexpected this is what a real thriller movie is all about i rushed into the video shop grabbed a movie without reading the entire blurb on the back and hoped for the best i was totally surprised and delighted i really enjoyed the actors and their characters i thought they all gave a great performance and made their characters realistic the plot was well thought outwell written and directed it kept you interested from start to finish and never got boring for a single minutei highly recommend this movie for those that like thrillers especially thrillers that are well paced and ones that keep your attention definitely a ten out of ten from me,1
as a horrormovie fan i try to watch all significant novelties of this genre especially those which are the products of my native cinema and i can say that that the power of fear or vedma as the russian title of it is one of the weakest film among them firstly it cannot scary even a little kid it paces so slowly and so predictable that there is no place for the real horror frankly speaking it is bad in all points from the goofy plot i do not know why the russian producersdirector decided to transform the classic story about ukrainian witchcraft into some lame and ridiculous moderndayamerica thriller i absolutely agree with the previous reviewer  it does not thrill a bit and to the terrible and cheesy actors work all actors including the leading valeri nikolayev and yevgeniya kryukova who are quite famous in russia look like wooden dolls or something like that and it seems to me they did not even bother to play at all only spoke their english lines without any expression and at the end i do not really understand why they filmed this flick in english with russian actors i think it was their wrong turn at least they could cast some american or english actors for the leading parts to make them look more convincing the same i can say about so called small american town backgrounds which were shot in estonia and look like it the only positive moment i found in the power of fear is the visual effects they are not excellent but rather good for the russian film and the music is ok at least it does not irritate me that is why i give it two stars overall if you want to see good horror film  do not waste your time and money on this boring flick and if you are looking for something that claims to be a russian horror i would advise you to find a copy of viy or the spirit of evil it is really the terrific movie based on the same novel as power of fear but much much better,0
this movie looked as if it might be good at the beginning but never fleshed out to it is expectations the director is talented and has some good camera angles and artistic ideas typical of the asian directors but does not know how to create or tell a good story to go along with it the story was fragmented and seemed to go off in all sorts of different directions throughout the film never finding a solid explainable interesting angle basically the movie never fit the explanation on the press releases the acting was very good however all the actors gave good performances and jude law was outstanding as he is always is it is too bad he chose to do such a weak film,0
what begins as a fairly clever farce about a somewhat shady security monitoring company turns almost instantaneously into an uninteresting and completely inane murder mystery david arquette and the great stanley tucci try mightily to make this train wreck watchable but some things are just not humanly possiblewhat for instance causes gale to turn suddenly from a sweet motherly figure into a drunken shrew at tommys parents house why would heinrich although admittedly a sleezebag want to destroy the business to which he devotes his life by robbing and possibly murdering his customers why does the seemingly sensible tommy believe that heinrich could be a murderer based almost entirely on a dream and even if that were believable why would not he go to the police and why did not gale activate the alarm when she got home especially after scolding howie about it being off of course all of these events are necessary for the plot and i use the term very very loosely to unfold and it might be forgivable if it resulted in even the slightest bit of comedy but everything from howies description of his date rape to the coroners misidentification of gale to the final joke about gale and howie still being dead is more tasteless and pathetic than anything elsei checked the box indicating that my comments contained spoilers but there is nothing more i or anyone else could do to spoil this thing that already stinks to high heaven,0
what can i say i think i have to write spoiler alert and then reveal they used the fword a lot in this movie  like in every two sentences i did not like this movie at all  too much hints on sexual perversions sidesteps and cheating and that swearing was totally out the window i gave this movie three and two of those points are for mira sorvinos sexy movements on the dance floor,0
the last reviewer was very generous i quiet like the first movie but cannot say i enjoy this one very much the beginning is bearable but it goes downhill pretty quickly i just do not see jon bon jovi as a badass vampire hunter and the vampire princess is neither sexy nor scary a lot of the scenes just do not make sense i mean any normal person would suspect something is up when a strange woman suddenly appearing out of nowhere to seduce you let alone an experienced hunter why una is able to communicate with jovi nothing was ever explain in this movie you would not mind if it was entertaining but that was too much to ask this has to be one of worst vampire movie i have seen,0
the late dudley moore had the most famous role of his tooshort career in one thousand nine hundred and eightyones arthur a raucously funny and alternately touching tale that generates warm smiles big bellylaughs and an occasional tear if you are in the right mood moore received a best actor oscar nomination for his performance as arthur bach a drunken playboy who races cars plays tennis fondles women but he has weekends off and he is his own boss arthur is destined to inherit seven hundred and fifty million dollars when he marries a snooty society girl named susan johnston jill eikenberrywho is the spoiled daughter of an undercover gangster things get sticky when arthur meets linda morolla liza minnelli a waitressstruggling actress from queens who steals neckties for her fathers birthday moore lights up the screen in one of the single funniest performances of the last fifty years the late sir john gielgud won a best supporting actor oscar for his flawless turn as arthurs acidtongued butler and best friend hobson whose outward disdain for arthurs behavior covers more paternal feelings there are other funny contributions by barney martin as lindas father stephen elliott as susans father and geraldine fitzgerald as arthurs demented grandmother the film was directed with a keen eye for comedy by a first time director named steve gordon who sadly died the following the year there was also a forgettable sequel several years later but this instant classic is not to be missed,1
as we all know the subgenre of sex comedies is pretty crowded simply being excessively raunchy is not enough anymore i have seen and heard so many disgusting jokes and actions that a sex comedy really needs to have other positive points to appeal to me these dayscoming into the forty year old virgin i knew basically what to expect i did see the commercials after all is it true that if you do not use it you lose it what i did not expect to find is a heart and honest attempts at character development there is still the weird offthewall characters that we see so much in adam sandler movies and there is still enough inappropriate language to sink noahs ark but somehow the movie has a worthwhile love story and yes even a messagethe main character andy is unfortunately for me a person i can relate to in the first shot i see that he even shares my love for mystery science theater three thousand he has a poster for the movie on his wall and throughout the movie we get to see his really neat collection of antiquities andy also has plenty of video games and a working knowledge of films and technology andy does not want to buy a car because he prefers his bike most importantly of all andy is a nice person he does not swear and he respect women so much that he stays away from them combine all these factors and everybody begins to think he is a serial murderer it is like my life storythe other characters each have funny little stories to go along with their slightly exaggerated personalities and they all work on a certain level but not the way andy does i felt that it was sort of distracting in a way since andy and his girlfriend trish are really the only truly human characters in the entire moviei suppose since i mentioned one flaw i might as well bring the other noticeable one to light the story is clever but too predictable and as far as romances go it is quite simple it deals with andys relationship with trish for a long time and we all know what is going to happen in the end sure its final detour is a bit different than we may expect but you know what is going to happen in the end and i assure you it does these are definitely small stains on the movie but there is so much good here that i can easily ignore it is few faultswhen i say good i mean bad of course this is a sex comedy and it wants to be bad for the most part i think it succeeded there are so many hilarious scenes such as andy trying to get rid of an erection after refusing to have sex with trish or the scene where andy goes with his trishs daughter to a sexual education class where he ends up asking more questions than anybody else ah and we must not forget the soon to be classic chest waxing sequence ooh como se llama an interesting little note about that scene the actor steve carell actually did wax his belly and the pain shown is real of course they only did one take but it was still a very brave thing to do on his partactually since we are talking about steve carell i would like to say that he has now risen on my list of respected comedians which is sort of odd since i did not even know who he was prior to seeing this film i was just so impressed by his writing acting and timing that i now really want to keep an eye out for his future roles this man has talent it the forty year old virgin proves thatto be honest i had doubts about this film but early word was positive and i knew it was something i was eventually going to see i am glad that i did too since it is probably one of the funniest movies i have seen in a long time and it doubles as something you feel is worth watching it is not simply a series of sex gags lumped together rather it is a series of sex gags entwined with a very worthwhile character and a truly touching romance now excuse me while i go puke my guts out i cannot believe i just wrote thatmy review from frider waves ,1
all this dismaying waste of film stock needs is count floyd popping up every sixty seconds somehow they got steve railsback susan anspach john vernon and joe flaherty together on a set and could not get within five miles about eight kilometers of an actual movie boy does this thing suck there is not one original line thought shot or effect from brainless opening sequence to brainless close the magical ethereal susan anspach of five easy pieces  boring steve railsback  boring john vernon  boring the big bug  boring if this is a scary movie buttercream gang is a thuglife documentary seriously  every bad movie contains its own explanation of its badness usually it is in the opening credits  written directed and produced by one guy or at the very center of the action is some bimbo so talentless that you know there is one and only one reason this turkey got made here you do not find out till the very last of the credits where the cooperation of about a dozen subfunctions of the canadian government is gratefully acknowledged right now i am watching msts take on beast of yucca flats to get the taste out of my mouth ghod what an improvement,0
this movie is poorly conceived poorly acted and poorly writtenjon heder is terribly annoying and cannot escape the same napolean dynamite routine selfobsessed and ignorantfurthermore diane keaton plays the same manish overly obsessed mother who cares too much and yet not nearly enough about the lives of her children see because i said so anna faris though i generally like her plays a vapid idiot in this film as welljeff daniels is passable but nothing special please skip this film if you want to keep your soul,0
all the worlds a stage and its people actors in itor something like that who the hell said that theatre stopped at the orchestra pitor even at the theatre door why is not the audience participants in the theatrical experience including the story itselfthis film was a grand experiment that said hey the story is you and it needs more than your attention it needs your active participation sometimes we bring the story to you sometimes you have to go to the storyalas no one listened but that does not mean it should not have been said,1
i had a lot of expectations from this movie and more so since it was a yashraj filmjimmy operates a call centre and one day he is invited by pooja singh to teach her boss lakhan singh english the two fall in love and decide to run away but pooja tells jimmy that she cannot do this as she owes a debt to lakhan singh who is also known as bhaiyyaji but they decide and steal money from him and its only then that jimmy finds out that bhaiyyaji  lakhan singh is a don in the meantime bhaiyyaji hires a man bachchan pandey to track down jimmy and poojastarring saif ali khan kareena kapoor anil kapoor and akshaye kumar the movie is directed by first time director viay krishna acharya and is produced by both aditya chopra and yash chopratashan has to be one of the worse films that i have ever watched yes the scenery is good and kareena kapoor and her much publicised weight loss looks good but plot is extremely thin on story and at times makes no sense from one scene to the other  hence why i have said at the beginning that i had expected more from this film as it was a yashraj production with reference to songs unfortunately there is not one song that i can remember nowthere are moments where one can laugh and that is mainly thanks to akshaye kumar and saif could have definitely done better while kareena kapoor played her part well but this cannot be said for anil kapoor  it did not suit him at all as a villain lastlynever mind aditya chopra who in the past has produced and directed good films such as mohabbatein what was yash chopra doing by producing such a trash movie conclusion bad movie not worth wasting your time and that is my first and last impression,0
no spoilers just plot details i cannot understand such hatred for this episode you want to watch a bad episode of smallville watch subterranean  now there is a sack of crap tom welling gives a good performance i do not say that very often and michael rosenbaum is great but he is most of the time the alternate universe scenario seems eerily realistic the martian manhunter who previously appeared in static returns and tells clark that the doctor that is the head of the insane asylum where they are being held at is actually a phantom from the phantom zone and if clark wants to return to his universe he must kill him an overall great episode with good acting and a decent pace,1
this is far more than the charming story of middleaged man discovering the pleasures of ballroom dancing although it is that as well it is the tale of one person learning to love life again pushing past all the pressures of work and money to discover joy once more the bonus in this film is a fascinating insight into the slowly changing attitudes of modern japan toward everything from ballroom dancing to physical contact there are scenes that will make you laugh out loud  a few where you will want to get up and tango  and many others where you will just feel goodthis is a great introduction to contemporary japanese filmmaking for those who might be under the impression that all japanese movies are heavy and inaccessible ,1
believe it or not at twelve minutes this film for one thousand nine hundred and twelve is a fulllength film very very few films were longer than that back then but that is definitely not what sets this odd little film apart from the rest no what is different is that all the actors with the exception of one frog are bugsyes bugs this simple little domestic comedy could have looked much like productions starring the likes of chaplin laurel and hardy or max linder but instead this russian production uses bugs or i think models that looked just like bugs chaplin and laurel and hardy were yet to be discovered and i assume linder was busy so perhaps that is why they used bugs using stopmotion the bugs moved and danced and fought amazingly welland a heck of a lot more realistically than king kong twentyone years later the film starts with mr beetle sneaking off for a good time he goes to a bawdy club while his wife supposedly waits at home but unfortunately for mr beetle he is caught on camera by a local film buff plus he does not know it but mrs beetle is also carrying on with a bohemian grasshopper painter of course there is a lot more to this domestic comedy than this but the plot is ageold and very entertaining for adults and kids alikeweird but also very amazing and watchable,1
i honestly cannot believe what passes for entertainment now death and making fun of death violence sexual innuendo adults threatening children crudeness alcohol abuse by minors drug theft dysfunctional parents babysitter from hell stereotypical jokes about african americans police and fat people and kids sneaking out of the house in the middle of the night  yup sure sounds like a kids movie to me  not add to that the dark and scary elements  a dead woman possessing and turning into a house and keeping her loving husband a prisoner inside for over twenty years and also terrorizing an entire neighborhood  how sweet for kids parents  is this really what you want your kids to be watching  is this what you want to teach them about lifethis movie is too scary for young kids and i am afraid that teens today may be living some of this movie scenario  so why rub it in their faces as for an adult audience  you will not find it scary or amusing  just boring contrived and predictable and the characters are just wrong  clueless parents ignorant police stupid and annoying friends nasty and manipulative babysitters and beer drinkingwomanizing boyfriends what great material for kids  does this really sound like a childrens movie to anyone even the computer animation and good voice work are not enough to redeem this terrible flick save your money save your time and save your childrens minds  go rent ice age monsters inc the incredibles shrek a bugs life  any of them are way better than this horrid film spielberg and zemeckis  shame on both of you for making such a disaster and then billing it as a childrensfamily movie,0
melissa joan hart shines this show is amazing there is no match except for maybe melissa in clarissa explains it all she was marvelous in that too this is so much better than buffy the vampire slayer this show is wonderful,1
i saw this many years after the television series and initially i did not care for it then as my memory of the series receded with the passage of time i watched again and found it absolutely hilarious based on the stage play by neil simon it has not been opened out much for the big screen and that is one of its strengths walter matthau and jack lemmon are brilliant as oscar and felix and the supporting cast are wonderful particularly john fielder as vinnie even now certain moments can reduce me to tears of laughter  felix interrupting oscar in the middle of a ball game with a dinner request oscar cracking up and chasing felix around the apartment the giggling pigeon sisters brought low by felixs sob stories and of course the legendary cafeteria scene  later ripped off by nora ephrons when harry met sally  razorsharp dialogue too when the boys think felix has taken an overdose oscar says they could be vitamins he could be the healthiest one in the room fantastic,1
i simply cannot believe the number of people comparing this favourably with the first film it moved me to leave this comment this is just an obvious attempt to cashin on the success of the first film the dialogue is appalling and nothing like as authentic or compelling as the original filmthe storyline is ridiculous the portrayal of the french police laughable and the characterisation of doyle a mile away from the first filmhow many drug bosses do you think go down to the docks in person to see a shipment come in the ease at which doyle finds his guy is just pathetic like all the french police were just drinking coffee until doyle turns up from america and does some real police work what a joke try going to a foreign city and unearthing the biggest crims in the place with a travel map and some tourist pamphlets pathetic a truly awful sequel anyone who thinks otherwise is crazy,0

the fluffer may have strong elements of porn industry truth to it  but that does not make up for the fact that it is pretty shabbily directed and acted  and with a very mediocre scriptb grade from start to the exceedingly drawn out finishit would be embarassing to think of the general public being offered this piece as an example of state of the art gay film makinghopefully it has a limited life in the gay film festival circuit and is allowed to die a natural death on videothis film will open the queer film weekend in brisbane on april ten two thousand and two i think its success there will be strongly influenced by the amount of alcohol consumed in the preceding cocktail party  they are going to need it,0
it looks like the brilliant team of shonda rhimes outsourced the writing of this one somewhere offshore maybe to the mediocreland pp reminds me any one of the many tedious promising at first but predictable within one season david kelly flicks picket fences ally mcbeal and now boston legal the crazy cases they get are so outlandish they barely evoke sympathy or sadness and that is what actually makes good medical dramas tick  dramatic situations you are afraid of this could be me sentiment they are not funny eitherthe actors are quite good but the plot lines are dead and cannot be brought back to live i am a therapist and let me tell you  amy brennan plays the most unbelievably incompetent unethical untrained therapist whoever writes her stuff flunked the ethics and the transferencecountertransference courses in stanford somebody should give them a code of ethics to read the episode with the nosebleeding wife and the therapists involvement in it no therapists are that badwomen yearning for men who have moved on  had been done to death we have all graduated sex and the city addison in her youthful aggression towards the guy she likes  very ageinappropriate looks so unnatural on a woman over forty and this otherwise talented actress does not believe it herself and does not deliver it very well the only successfulpalatable developments are addison struggling with her decision to move to la and the voodoo dr and his coping with widowhoodthis concept might work with a whole new writing team,0
diane and i saw this fabulous film today in fremantle and we both agreed that of the pastiche movies it was head and shoulders above the rest i say that because we were entranced by the brief five to ten minute segments that composed the film and the fact that this film had a theme around which each piece was composed and of course that theme was love in its many formsostensibly the film took place in the various parisian arrondisments thus giving a particular flavour to each segment having only been in paris several times i was not knowledgeable enough to readily recognize the locations but i am sure europeans and particularly french people could easily recognize the citys locations in any event the viewer is immediately pulled into each story because of their production excellence so these city locations fade into inconsequencethe film moves quickly and the viewer is left absorbing one scenario while the new one is on the screen the stories themselves are not graphic like some pulp hollywood nonsense they are subtle and thought provoking and gentle as with most of life without the media swath that buries so much of lifes beauty under the nearest dung heap just to sell sell sell go with someone you care for and allow this magical little film to bathe you like a spa treatment and when you leave my guess is you will feel renewed,1
brian yuzna is often frowned upon as a director for his trashy gorefests but the truth is that his films actually are not bad at all the reanimator sequels are not as great as the original but are still worthy as far as horror sequels are concerned return of the living dead three is the best of the series and society is not a world away from being a surrealist horror masterpiece this thriller certainly is not a masterpiece but it shows yuznas eye for horror excellently and the plot moves in a way that is always thrilling and engaging i am really surprised that a horror movie about dentistry did not turn up until one thousand nine hundred and ninetysix as going to the dentist is almost a primal fear  it is running away from a tiger for the modern world dentistry does not frighten me but surprisingly i would appear to be in the minority the plot follows perfectionist dentist dr feinstone he has a nice house a successful career and a beautiful wife  pretty much everything most people want however his life takes a turn for the worse when he discovers his wifes affair with the pool cleaner and his life is not the only one as it is his patients who feel the full brunt of his angerwhen it comes to scaring the audience this movie really makes itself however credit has to go to the director for extracting the full quota of scares from the central theme the fact that he does a good job is summed up by the fact that i am not squeamish about going to the dentist  yet one particular scene actually made me cover my eyes the film follows the standard man going insane plot outline only with the dentist you always get the impression that there is more to the film than what we are seeing it is not very often that a gore film can impress on a substance level  and while this will not be winning any awards the parody on the upper class is nicely tied into the plot the acting while bclass is actually quite impressive with corbin bernsen taking the lead role and doing a good job of convincing the audience that he really is a man on the edge i should thank brian yuzna for casting ken foree in the movie the dawn of the dead star does not get enough work and i really love seeing him in films the rest of the cast does not massively impress but all do their jobs well enough overall the dentist offers a refreshing change for nineties slasher movies the gore scenes are sure to please horror fans and i do not hesitate to recommend this film,1
i rented this film in dvd form without knowing anything at all about it part of a winter marathon of watching a film every night after several awful american action adventure films ballistic daredevil cradle of life zhu warriors struck me as brilliantly original filmmaking the story is complete nonsense but i found the films sincerity good heartedness and complete lack of irony refreshing and the film looks spectacular sure the special effects are not technically as flawless as those produced by hollywood but the filmmakers wisely are more interested in color composition and movement than realism and so many of the shots are breathtaking in one shot two of the superhuman characters stand on craggy spires of rock a huge moon rising before them the image perfectly balanced by the three elements in another a princesswarrior spires through the heavens behind her glowing sword like a heatseeking missile and the colors explode from shot to shot used to express emotion rather than to represent realitythe characters have the same simplicity and directness of comic book characters offering no great depth in themselves but referring to archtypes that resonate more deeply physically several of the actors are astonishingly beautiful they play their roles straight up without irony or guile and so are believablemost strange of all despite the clumsiness of plot and thin characterizations i found myself very near tears at the end moved by the beautiful simplicity of the actors and the wildly original goodhearted vision of the director,1
i have been going through the afis list of the top one hundred comedies and i must say that this is truly one of the worst not just of the ninety movies on the list i have seen but of any movie i have ever seen drunks are funny sometimes dudley is not liza almost made it worthwhile but alas just go watch arrested development if you want to see her in something good seriously dudley laughing and drinking is supposed to be funny i would highly recommend almost any other movie on the afis top one hundred comedies for more laughs than this if you want to see a funnier drunk try the thin man funnier movie in general any marx brothers movie will kill especially if you are as drunk as arthur,0

i think a lot of people just wrote this off as another one of tom cruises weird movies magnolia eyes wide shut but vanilla sky is definitely its own movie many people said it was weird it was not it was different and confusing but not weird weird is stanley kubrick or pauly shore different is the truman show confusing is the matrix or the game and unlike kubrick this movie has a conclusion everything makes sense  maybe not immediately maybe not even today but it will make sense vanilla sky is confusing because david aames tom cruise is confused that is the point that is where the socalled weirdness that turned critics away came in if they had bothered to open their eyes as the original one thousand nine hundred and ninetyseven spanish movie they would have seen that and if that is not enough reason to see it go see it for the music cameron crowe offers a wonderful soundtrack he uses it to set the feel  that notorious element that many movies lack with songs like the beach boys good vibrations playing at the dramatic and emotional climax of the movie he creates an offbeat yet astoundingly right feel a wonderful film in its script music acting and images vanilla sky is sadly a superficial bandwagon movie that critics chide in order to appear intelligent excellent a,1
the whole biker movie genre has to be made up of the worst films ever made this one delivers a lot of fighting generous amounts of blood bikers fighting indians and a shanty town that gets blown up and torn down one shack at a time the acting is beyond terrible what ever happened to robert walker jr at one point he was in some major studio productions and then he just faded away this movie really blows but if you have not seen a biker movie in a long time it is a good one to watch at the end of the movie you should feel a bit trashy for having watched it,0

sitting down to watch the fourteenth season of the bachelor on the wings of love i knew i would be in for an interesting time i had watched some of the previous seasons of the bachelor in passing watching an episode or two and missing the next three or so i find that the bachelor is often appealing and intriguing though its quality and morality are often lackingon the wings of love details the journey taken by jake a thirtyone year old commercial pilot from dallas texas to find true love as true a love as one can find in a seasonlong realitydrama dating show jake meets twentyfive beautiful girls from all over the country he begins to get to know them a bit but it is mostly superficial how well can you get to know someone in a few five minute conversations jake tries to make his true intentions known from the very beginning at least to the audience he noted that he does not just want love or a good time but he wants a fiancé or wife we can only assume that he has made this clear to the women in the competition as well if that is the case it might explain to a degree some of the womens actions the women are super competitive while they do not even know jake at all yet they are still in it to win it no matter what the costnot only were the women competitive but they were also confident and catty threats backstabbing and warnings of watch out all show that these women were not there for a good time either jake noted that he was not just looking for sex appeal but looking for a connection however the girls pulled out all the stops to try to impress jake with said sex appeal they arrived at the mansion in skimpy dresses  either lowcut or shortwhile some girls seemed to maintain their sense of decorum others missed that memo altogether one girl channy noted that jake was a good guy to whom she could be a naughty girl she went on to say that jake could land on her runway anytime she got flack from the other girls for her provocative statement which showed their take on these situationsso a reality dating show could not be that bad could it besides the obvious issue of sexdriven attraction there are other issues that mar this seemingly harmless show is this the right way to find a future mate vying for someone is attention by flaunting oneself to extreme proportions unfortunately however that is what america has reduced dating to these days pleasure and sex without commitment and a little happiness on the sideanother problem is the premature emotional attachment by which many of the girls bound themselves to jake a few girls in particular seemed to be overly attached one girl said if i do not get that first impression rose it will kill me as mentioned before they do not even know him yet and she was talking about a specific rose not just one of the fifteen roses to keep from being eliminatedmichelle in particular seemed to have some issues with attachment to jake the other girls noticed it too after one particular michelle outburst vienna asserted that michelle had a mental breakdown and we have only been here an hour michelle got the last rose of the evening on the first show  narrowly missing elimination  and was extremely emotional about it the other girls thought it was simply ridiculous another girl also cried but because she was eliminatedit began with survivor and from there it just took off  reality tv it shows our entertainment interests as a country if we were not watching the shows and giving them good ratings the networks would not continue to run them the only logical conclusion that can be drawn is that enough of america is hooked one thing is clear america in general loves reality tv and its ensuing trappingsthis begs me to question why is it that we even like reality tv what is it about it that draws us to it is it because we see the similarities to our own lives or is it because we want to be sure that we are more stable and less pathetic than others whatever it is that draws us to it we should be careful of the media and entertainment that we allow to fill our minds i am not saying that all reality tv shows are bad however i am saying that we need to evaluate each oneepisodes used for critique season premier and episode two,0
after his classic film noir homage chinatown roman polanski returned to the themes that had given him his greatest hits in the sixtys with this creepy psychological horror which like repulsion and rosemarys baby deals with the paranoia and claustrophobia generated by apartment livingclaustrophobic environments are the ones which polanski is best at creating and this has to be the most suffocating and confined picture he ever created the emphasis on side walls and distant vanishing points is greater than ever and even in the small number of exterior scenes the sky is rarely glimpsed but the tenant is not just confined spatially but also in the intensity with which it focuses on its protagonist trelkovsky played by polanski himself is not only in every scene he is in virtually every shot when he is not on screen more often than not the camera becomes trelkovskys point of view and of course almost everywhere he looks he sees his own reflection staring back at him in a mirrori cannot think of any film that is more about the internalisation and solitude of one character some psychological thrillers like m or peeping tom manipulate us into feeling sorry for the mentally ill protagonist others like psycho attempt indepth scientific analysis of his mental condition the tenant fits into neither of these categories  it simply immerses us completely inside trelkovskys experience without demanding we actually understand or appreciate what is going on inside his head we feel his paranoia and obsession even though it is constantly revealed to us that they are irrationalpolanski was also a master of the slowly unfolding horror film often in his horrors there is an ambiguity as to whether there is actually anything sinister going on but they are among the most effective at frightening audiences why precisely because they unfold so slowly and invest so much time in painstakingly setting up situations that they immerse the viewer in paranoia a much later polanski horror the ninth gate is a bit of a mess plotwise but at least it still manages to achieve that creeping sense of dreadthis is a rare chance to see polanski himself in a major role his talent in front of the camera was as good as behind it and he is absolutely perfect as the meek trelkovsky another standout performance is that of the alltoooften overlooked shelley winters as the concierge in actual fact it is rather a stellar cast although many of the familiar faces look out of place in this strange gothic european movie also sadly many of the french actors in supporting roles are atrociously dubbed in the english language versionthe tenant is more polished and less pretentious than repulsion but it lacks the suspense and the character that make rosemarys baby so engrossing and entertaining the tenant is good with no major flaws and polanski was really on top form as a director but it is not among his most gripping works,1
this was my favourite film as a child and i have been in the stage production a few times so it will always remain my favourite muscical and i doubt anybody could ever remake the story of oliver twist on screen any better than this one didmy alltime favourite bad guy has to be oliver reed as bill sikes not only did he scare the life out of my when i watched it as a six year old but now as a woman i can empathize more with nancys character the bar maidprostitute who helps oliver get the life he deservesjack wilde as the artful dodger was fantastic and i do not think anybody could ever outdo him as the streetpocket picker and best friend of fagin the music is fantastic especially fagins numbers i am also quite thankful they did not give bill sikes a musical number it would not of worked with him being such a sinister characteri think carol reed did an excellent job of nancys sticky ending keeping it a g rated movie by disguising her beating but giving enough away to show the violence of bill towards her this movie is both charming and charismatic as a musical singalong as well as being a moving drama that follows a young boy as he tries to find where he belongs in life,1
this is what the musical genre was made of humor talent romance and action all rolled into onefrank sinatra was wonderful nothing else needs to be said marlon brando although not a singer did a great job winning the hearts of many with his portrayal of sky masterson the fact that he could not sing added to his character the ladies in the film were alright but the men in the movie definitely stole the showit is a true classic that can be appreciated at any age it connects with all audiences and makes you smile and laughdefinitely a movie to be watched and enjoyed,1
though i never like to be the sort of person who negates anothers personal taste if you like something that is fine but this movie was horrible and there is no way around it i do not like ani difranco too much but she is a great guitarist and songwriter that i can admit but i cannot admit to there being any redeeming qualities to this film many people way that it is an accurate portrayal of issues that high school students face maybe but everything is portrayed too farfetched there seems to be an attempt at a naked gun  esque kind of comedy but the timing is off there is too much space between each actors line as if they are holding for laughter there was not any whoever wrote the script was all over the place they tried to cram as many controversial issues together in one film almost never fully developing any of them especially the girl getting impregnated by a teacher i did not laugh once throughout this entire movie i was too insulted by this attempt at humor and satire to do anything but roll my eyes at the screen,0
i have seen this film only the one time about twentyfive years ago and to this day i have always told people it is probably the best film i have ever seen considering there was no verbal dialogue and only thought dialogue i found the film to be enthralling and i even found myself holding my breath so as not to make any sound i would highly recomend this film i wish it was available on dvd,1
winchester seventythree is the story of a man jimmy stewart obsessed with getting back his prized possession a repeating rifle made by winchester the rifle keeps changing hands and stewart doggedly keeps after it this one thousand nine hundred and fifty bw effort by anthony mann is more a crime film than a traditional western and the cowboys often seem more like modernday gangsters than oldfashioned cowboys shelley winters plays a woman of questionable virtue who is headed for a ranch with a man charles drake she may marry she ends up falling for stewart but not before she is passed around a bit winters is the most complex character in a film filled with unusual characters watch for a young dan dureyea as a nutty killer and tony curtis in a very small role a woefully miscast will geer plays wyatt earp,1
i will keep this one quite short i believe that this is an extraordinary movie i see other reviewers who have commented to the effect that it is badly written poorly shot has a terrible soundtrack and worse that it is not real in its portrayal of life ok so it may not be quite believable for its whole length but this movie carries a message of hope which some others seemed to have missed hope that it is not too late to save people from the terrible things that go on in so many lives gangland violence is real right is it right no this movie carries an important social message which the cynics may dislike but which nonetheless is to be praised rather than denigrated i have watched this movie with great enjoyment at least eight times each time with equal enjoyment and each time with the feeling that maybe the world could be made better and is not beyond saving well not until two thousand and eight anyway nine out of ten from me for this one it is very nearly perfect in my view jmv,1
did the moviemakers even preview this before they released it the script jumps from place to place without giving much explanation the beginning does not clarify if its a prequel or not it starts with supermans beginnings on earth and then jumps to a point after the last movie  but does not really alert the viewer of this very confusing superman himself is weak and in need of prozac he is portrayed as a potential homewrecker a stalker and someone who is clearly depressed and confused this type of character rarely makes for an interesting hero the ending is absolutely ridiculous superman ending up in a hospital just made me want to kill him off myself i am seriously waiting for a snl skit where superman appears on maury povich and maury says the results are in  in the case of the child superman you are the father to sum up  ok acting by this superman and kevin spacey but horrible script the movie is basically unwatchable,0
this is a quirky little movie and i have to agree that there is some quirky acting in it as wellit follows the adventures of a young man who decides that he wants to become a famous las vegas illusionist and is partly about following his dream partly about the dreams of others and all about the travails of showbiz i thought the movie was charming and it has a moment or two of real magic that make the whole thing worthwhilealan arkin is terrific as the magician who never was and his mentoring of max makes for a funny and touching relationshipnot for everyone probably but if you like movies about the journey then i think you will like this one,1
wow my first review of this movie was so negative that it was not excepted i will try to tone this one down let us be real no one wants to see a chuck norris movie where he is not the main characterthere was a good fight scene at the end but the rest of the movie stank i have to wonder if old chuck just cannot hang with the best any more has he slowed down so much that he has to turn out junk like this and hope that his reputation will carry him through the entire movie chuck is an awesome martial artist and as we have seen from walker texas ranger a fairly good actor but the trick is to combine both of these qualities in his movies and this one does not very disappointing for us norris fans chuck stay as the main character in your movies because this does not work for yougary,0
this movie is not porn it was not meant to be porn and unless my uncle runs for president of the world it should never be considered pornnow that that issue was sorted out i can say i thoroughly recommend this film as it is issues are still widely available it is funny the acting is great and it raises seriouscurious questionsi cannot fully understand why this film was so mistreated probably this is why i plan to never visit the us lena is the true pioneer of the modern riotgrrrl movement confusion curiosity and wit are her main attributes she is occasionally angry but are not we all,1
spoilersi was very disappointed in loves abiding joy i had been waiting a really long time to see it and i finally got the chance when it reaired thursday night on hallmark i love the first three love movies but this one was nothing like i thought it was going to be the whole movie was sad and depressing there were way to many goofs and the editing was very poor  to many scenes out of context i also think the death of baby kathy happened way to soon and clarks appearance in the movie just did not seem to fit it seemed like none of the actors really wanted to be there  they were all lacking emotion there seemed to be no interaction between missie and willie at alli think the script writers should have went more by the book it seems like every movie that is been made so far just slips further and further away from janette okes writings i mean in the movie they never mentioned a thing about the mine and the two boys or clark getting hurt because of it and i think missie and willies reactions to kathys death could have been shown and heard rather than just heardout of the four movies that have been made so far i would have to say that loves abiding joy is my least favorite i hope with the next four movies that more of the book is followed and if clarks character is in them i hope he is got a bigger part and i hope his part is not so bland i also hope there is more of scottie and cookie and maybe even marty but who knows what the script writers will have in store next,0
this is a really fun movie one of those you can sit and mindlessly watch as the plot gets more and more twisted more and more funny sally field teri hatcher in her heyday kevin klein elisabeth shue robert downey jrit is all these wellknown quality actors acting as if they are soap opera starsproducers if you have ever watched a soap opera and thought how on earth did they come up with this idea you will love this movie i have seen it multiple times and each time i watch it the more i appreciate the humor the more i realize just how wellacted it really is do not expect oscar quality this is a fun movie to entertain not some artsy attempt at finding mans inner man etc sit back relax and laugh,1
the opening flourishes left me purring with delight at their inventiveness  the altered version of the archers logo the introductory disclaimer the way the camera pans over the cosmos it is strange to think that it is a wonderful life came out in the same year no great coincidence the one thousand nine hundred and fortys was awash with heavenandearth films but the glowing cotton wool nebulas and cutesy angels of the competition look tattered something best passed over in silence when placed next to alfred junges visionit continues to look great all the way through as more and more striking ideas are sprung upon us i am not a great fan of mixing colour with black and white in general one of the two visual schemes almost always looks ugly when placed next to the other not so here powell dissolves colour into monochrome and monochrome into colour as if it is the most natural thing in the world a mere change of palettes both the colour photography and the black and white could stand on their ownas for the story  this may be pressburgers best script or at least it would have been had the conclusion been a more logical outcome of preceding events other than that it is tight yet with more going on than i can possibly allude to here was the heavenly stuff real or imaginary or both perhaps carter dreamt up a fantasy that was as it so happened true everyone says we are meant to neither ask nor answer this question but i do not see why i am sure we are meant to ask the question the film even gives us clues as to what the answer is  indeed the problem is that there are too many clues and they seem at first to be pointing in different directions the fact that other things ought to occupy our attention as well does not mean that this should not occupy us as well there is as i have said before a lot going onconsider the scene in which abraham farlan heavens prosecuting lawyer plays a radio broadcast of a cricket match and contemptuously says the voice of england one thousand nine hundred and fortyfive dr reeves the defence acknowledges the exhibit with a great deal of embarrassment and then produces one of his own a blues song from america which farlan listens to as though he is got a lemon in his mouth reeves looks smugsnobbery well i do not see why it is snobbish to condemn blues music  and that is not what powell and pressburger are doing anyway as the song is being played we get a shot of the american soldiers listening to it several of them nod their heads to the rhythm perfectly at home they do not find it incomprehensible there is something valuable about the song and neither reeves nor farlan knows what it is reeves probably realises as much all english audiences and all australian indian etc audiences as well know without being told that there is something of value in the cricket broadcast too and that while reeves understands that he is unable to explain it to farlan  hence the blues broadcast which shows that people can understand each other without sharing an understanding of everything else it is a clever sceneone last thing i found david niven a bit cold without the charisma he would acquire later in his career but even so i do not think a film has grabbed my heart quite so quickly after the action began as this one did,1
sorry everyone i know this is supposed to be an art film but wow they should have handed out guns at the screening so people could blow their brains out and not watch although the scene design and photographic direction was excellent this story is too painful to watch the absence of a sound track was brutal the loooonnnnng shots were too long how long can you watch two people just sitting there and talking especially when the dialogue is two people complaining i really had a hard time just getting through this film the performances were excellent but how much of that dark sombre uninspired stuff can you take the only thing i liked was maureen stapleton and her red dress and dancing scene otherwise this was a ripoff of bergman and i am no fan f his either i think anyone who says they enjoyed one onetwo hours of this is well lying,0
i have been impressed with chavezs stance against globalisation for sometime now but it was not until i saw the film at the amsterdam documentary international film festival that i realize what he has really achieved this film tells the story of coupconspiracy by venezuelas elite the oil companies and oil loving corrupt western governments to remove democratically elected president chavez and return venezuela back to a brutal dictatorship this film is must for anyone who believes in freedom and justice and is also a lesson to the rest of world  i commend the people of venezuela for taking matter into their own hands and saving their country from the likes of halliburton and the bush regime,1
if you are looking for a definitive biography of the life of boxer james corbett then this is probably not the film for you the famed boxer receives a one thousand nine hundred and fortys hollywoodization of his lifemaking the story far more entertaining and engaging than real life however because the performances were so good particularly by errol flynn and the script so likable the films embellishments can be forgivenerrol flynn plays gay ninetiesera boxer james gentleman jim corbetta man who became world boxing champ in one thousand eight hundred and ninetytwo the film goes from his rather humble beginnings and follows his through his career through him winning the title match against john l sullivan however while it could have focused mostly on the matches most are rather brief in the film except for the final title match and the emphasis is on corbetts brash personality as well as his relationship with the lady played by alexis smith throughout the film there is excellent supporting work done by a cast of wonderful supporting actors such as the perennial supporting actor in flynn films alan hale and the writing really helped bring these people alivewhat is particularly nice about the film is seeing the athleticism of flynn as a boxer while a few of the shots are of doubles almost all the boxing scenes are of flynn and he did a convincing job as a pugilist this was a nice departure for flynn who generally played pretty boy roles or swashbucklers and this shows just how tough a character he was to find out more about this try reading a biography of himhe was quite the rough and tumble character before coming to hollywoodnow as for the real james corbett read on if you are not afraid of finding out how the movie is not accurate first corbett was not a poor guy coming from a poor family but was college educated and bright second while he did get alexis smith at the end of the film they also divorced a few years later third the wonderfully touching final scene of the film between sullivan and corbett was probably the best part of the film sullivan was a jerk and this never could have happenedin reality sullivan was more the egomaniac and corbett was not the fatheaded guy they portrayed in the filmthough it made for a lovely film,1
the muppets take manhattan is different in a lot of ways to every other muppet movie made so far for one it remains the only muppet film not owned by disney as of two thousand and eight the film still belongs to twentyth century fox cbs fox at the time of its release even though disney owns the rights to the muppets also this film has a story line that is very nonlinear and events that are otherwise unpredictableof course it is very hard to beat the original muppet movie from one thousand nine hundred and seventynine especially since that movie had more memorable songs than manhattan does however one way in which the muppets take manhattan is better than the muppet movie is perhaps the surprisingly realistic scenarios in the first movie all the muppets really have to do is go to hollywood walk into an agents office and they are immediately given a rich  famous contract in this movie the muppets learn that they actually have to work for their desired success and it is a lot harder to do that especially in the entertainment business than they initially thought that is an important and often times overlooked message provided one is willing to suspend the disbelief that the muppets being small and made of cloth do not necessarily have to live in a spacious place or even eat respectively above all their struggle to make it after graduating college creates a very good story another note the celebrity cameos in the movie were cool and they surprisingly managed not to take away the spotlight from the muppets that ability right there is a testament to henson and how appealing the muppet characters were even to adultswhere manhattan falls flat and this is where i am sure people will disagree with me is with some of the key songs especially in the end i thought the wedding song he will make me happy was too somber for such a happy occasion as a wedding it sounded more like a song that is played at a funeral every time i watch this movie hearing that song makes me unusually depressed especially when the film begins on such an upbeat number as together again and ends happily for that matter saying goodbye was a sad number too but it fit better into the movie because the muppets were disbanding and were not sure they were going to see each other again that last song was such a let down and perhaps even added to younger viewers misery of seeing their favorite muppets leave the big screenthe muppets take manhattan is overall a good film and one that marches to the beat of a different drum than the other muppet films including the newer ones made after the deaths of jim henson and richard hunt fortunately the film marches in the same direction as well i just wished the film ended on a better song that was not quite so melancholy plus disney should have gotten its hands on this films copyright and given it a proper dvd release maybe it will someday we will see,1
last november i had a chance to see this film at the reno film festival i have to say that it was a lot of fun a few tech errors aside it was a great experience i loved the writing and acting especially from the guy that played the lead role there is a lot of heart in this movie a lot of wit to i got a chance to speak with a few of the filmmakers after it was done and they seemed real nice all in all the whole movie was just a positive experience and one i would definitely recommend the story was entertaining and cool as a woman i have been through a lot of the same problems as the lead guy and i could really understand his problems because of it the movie does a great job of giving us people we can sympathize with the friends in the movie are really well written to they are realistic i know people like these i only wish imy friends and i could sound as cool as these people when we talk the whole movie is just real cool i wish there were more films out there like it jayden,1
for anyone who wishes to get an impression of the soviet view of modern russian history this monumental film is a treasure the story starts at the turn of the century one thousand nine hundred in the yellowish sepia colours of old photographs which improves to black and white during the middle of the century and to full colour when the story approaches modern times ie the one thousand nine hundred and sixtysthe story focuses on a boy in a remote siberian village who is marked by the arrival and arrest of an anarchist during the czarist era he later joins the bolsheviks after the revolution and brings soviet communism to his village his son by the local beauty fights the germans during the second world war when he returns to the village the oil industry takes off and we are treated to some soviet economic idealismthis film is long and slow but utterly logic and very well made it can be seen in three parts,1
i guess this would be a great movie for a true believer in organized christian dogma but for anyone with an open mind who believes in free will rational thinking the separation of church  state and good science fiction it is a terrible jokethere are some well known actors who were either badly in need of work or had a need to share their personal beliefs with the rest of us heathensi was entertained by this movie in the same way i was entertained by reefer madness that movie attempted to teach drug education by scare tactics the same way this movie tries to teach christian principles with the threat of hell and misery for otherwise good people who do not share their interpretations of our worldit had me howling with laughter and at the same time scared me to realize how many people actually believe that our society should revert to the good old days of the nineteenth century,0
here is a rare gem for those of you that have not seen or most likely not even heard of this during the eightys dennis quaid was a hot commodity but in the early ninetys dennis quaid disappeared from the scene in one thousand nine hundred and ninetythree he burst back onto the big screen with three movies all of which unfortunately bombed two of those films i liked very much and let me elaborate on one of themwilder napalm is a crazy flick about two brothers wallace quaid and wilder arliss howard whom arefire starters yes they have the power of pyrokinetics wilder has decided not to use his power anymore for anything not useful anyway after a fatal incident during his youth where he and his brother blew up an abandoned house which killed a man who was inside unbeknownest to them nowadays wilder is a firefighter and is married to the wacky vida debra winger who is under house arrest for guess what arson see the movie to understand this better wilder also has not spoken to wallace in five years because wallace set his hair on fire during his bachelor partywallace loves his pyro power and uses it for amusement he also runs a carnival and is the head clown when the carnival comes to wilders town wallace decides to reunite with his brother and also to see vida whom which wallace has been in love with vidas house arrest sees its end but wilder is preoccupied so wallace steps in and the fun begins brother vs brotherfighting fire with fire some great fireball throwing in this flickeat your heart out drew barrymorethe film also has some really weird yet funny elements like wilders fire unit sings songs acapella during firefights and after wards jim varney globally known as ernest pops in as wallaces redneck carnival buddy wilder napalm is brilliantly shotand cleverly put togethervery off the wall and avantguardgive this one a look,1
i cannot say that this film deserves anywhere near the amount of vitriol being heaped on it by some reviewers yes it is bogged down by an overlypadded running time hamfisted editing and an overreliance on cheeseball special effects and it lacks much of the energy a comedy needs to get your average audience member to sit through it without checking his or her watch on the other hand it is also got some laughoutloud funny lines a talented and earnest cast and the classic underdog premise macy stiller and azaria are brilliant as the core team and garofalo and studi do superb work adding conflict and variety to the team i cannot say reubens or mitchell added much to the film overall though each had a few chances to shine the plot as i said above is your classic underdogmakesgood stuff no surprises there since you know they are going to triumph what makes it worthwhile is not the absurd gaudy heroes and villains but the dialogue and interplay between the characters underneath it all these people are children at heart who just want to do right the best scenes in the film give this film its emotional grounding look at azarias relationship with his longsuffering mother macys endearing innocence in his unwillingness to accept cap amazings secret identity stillers rage not unlike that one weird spazzy kid you once knew who would always go into quivering impotent rages on the playground garofalos desire to avenge her father this childlike belief that a sense of justice and goodness will always make the world a better place is the true appeal of superhero comics and underneath its parodic exterior mystery men shows us why these hackneyed comicbook tropes matter to so manyit never really gels into a satisfying whole due to the huge number of halfbaked subplots romance family life conflicts within the team etc but the main plot is such loopy fun that it makes up for that the fact that it is supposed to be good nonsensical fun seems to be lost on some of the reviewers here so i will issue a caveat if you are the type of viewer who finds his enjoyment of an itchy and scratchy cartoon ruined by the unexplained and illogical am i to believe this is some sort of snort magic xylophone then you are far too literalminded and humorless for this film go rent a sandler film insteadseventen,1
the performances of fishbourne who appears strangely funny somehow and short featureded harris are remarkable unlike connerys who does not appear to find sense in his role and ends up in the motorial behaviour of a eightyyr old man in fact the screenplay does not make sense imagine a sixty min happy endingplot plus a sudden turn appendix without any argumental structure in respect to the characters it is more an accident than a screenplay and may be good for examination purposes at screenwrights schools the more you remind the details the stronger this impression gets the capital punishment is not an issue here although it is a subject from the beginning it sort of fades away without further comment the subjectmatter and environment could have been good,0
harman and isings old mill pond is a true masterpiece of the art of animation the consummate skill and artistry that characterise this duos work is nowhere more in evidence than in this cartoon it is a shame that so many people can see only offence in what is and was always intended to be a light hearted piece of entertainment that in no way sought to denigrate black people if anything it is a tribute to the infectious humour and musicality of the black race i have not been able to view this confection for many years as the race commissars in england have deemed it too offensive to be shown in multi racial britain if anyone knows where i can obtain a copy i would dearly love to view this masterpiece again i think those who routinely look for messages and intent that were never intended in these cartoons which are after all sixty years old should try to lighten up and remember that the world is a very different place today but that does not mean that anyone has the right to censor what is viewable from the past,1
look it is the third one so you already know it is bad and maniac cop was not good enough to warrant the second installment so you know it is even worse but how much worse awful approaching godawfulwhen maniac cop goes on a killing spree a reporter exclaims what happened here can only be described as a black rainbow of deathone rainbows are not black and can never be two rainbows are harmless and can never inflict pain or death three a news reporter one valuable to his agency might find another way to describe the aftermath of a killing spree a black rainbow of death is not the only way to describe the given situationthis is what you are in for,0
i saw this film again and noticed how close it is to the novel if we ignore the part about carys leslie howard childhood considering thatat the time not much can be shown on the screen not that there is much in the novel the obsession of the character with mildred bette davis is very well conveyed to the audience i recommend this film to anyone who ever fell for another person and the other side tried to take advantage of him or her i have read that maugham was asked to make a recording of the novel for sale but when he started to in the studio he began crying and could not finish more than a few lines and whole project was chucked one can tell the novel is written from the heart and the film is a goodadaptation of a part of it at least,1
notice i have given this one star if the option been given i would have given this zero as i put this dvd into my tv and sat down on my couch i was expecting some of the worst film making at its finest i looked this movie up on imdb and saw that it was the worst rated movie so i guess i came into it critical of every mistake but it did not prepare me for the crap that was about to spew from my television screenthe box makes this movie out to look well ok at best do not let that fool you this movie needs to be banned from all shelves around the worldthe best way i can describe this movie is like porn but without any sex scenes in it the acting if you can call it that the plot so many holes must look like swiss cheese and the special effects really are just terribleplease do not be like me and rent this movie because you think it will be funny to watchin the end i am not saying i can make a better movie than this but i am thinking it,0
i used this film in a religion class i was teaching the golden fish is swimming happily in his bowl in an upper floor apartment a young boy and his mother are away from home the boy has been given money to buy milk on the way home he stops at carnival to play a game next to him stands a man in a black suit looking a little scary the boy drops the bottle of milk it breaks the man in the black suit gives him money to replace the milk this scene alternates with what is happening at home a black cat climbs the fire escape and enters the apartment he discovers the fish bowl and watches it the fish swims energetically and flips out of the bowl by now a bunch of teenagers in my class and i have fallen in love with the fish the cat takes the fish in his mouth and we all hold our breath the cat drops the fish into the bowl the double story line includes the suspicious man in black and the suspicious black cat both inspire prejudice both are innocent it was a great discussion starter in my class,1
when a film has no fewer than five different titles it usually means several things and almost always means that the film has major flaws somewhere necromancy has major flaws and is just out and out bad i saw the version on video called rosemarys disciples yes i am sure it differs from other versions but i am not inclined to think that in any way is any other version and the few more minutes it might have  going to be really any better the story is perhaps the biggest problem the film opens with laurie waking up and her husband taking her to a town where he has a new job at a toy factory for occultistsyep it gets bad this early the town is called lillith and has some guy with a rifle on the bridge to make sure only those selected by the owner of the town are allowed in soon we find that everyone living in lillith is a witch and all follow the directives of mr cato  the head of this municipal coven who wants his dead son backhence the name necromancy the people in the town do witch kind of stuff  have ceremonies some like wearing a goats head and promiscuity aboundsnot much really shown in this area but none of these people are very good actors mr cato is played robustly by the figuratively and literally largerthanlife movie maverick orson welles welles is misused but make no mistake he is the best thing in this movie and that is really the saddest part of necromancy as welles gives a pretty poor and pedestrian performance with little directorial guidance in one scene at a party director bert i gordon keeps going back to welles watching the action of the party using the exact same frames it looked ridiculous as did the scene that was repeatedly seen over and over again of a womans arm centered in swirling flames after a car crash it looked like the arm of a shop mannequin the story is never fully utilized as we never really know what happens many scenes are shot like dreams or hallucinations and never confirmed this also applies to the corny hokey ending the lead pamela franklin is pert and pretty and has some talent other than her performance real slim pickings from the rest of the cast sans welles the direction and story were both done by gordon who obviously had little gas left in the engine this is not a good movie in any way under any name,0
prix de beauté was made on the cusp of the changeover from silence to sound which came a little later in europe than in hollywood originally conceived as a silent it was released with a dubbed soundtrack in france with a french actress speaking louise brooks lines but was released as a silent in italy and other parts of europe i was lucky enough to see the cineteca di bolognas flawless new restoration of an italian silent print at the tribeca film festival i have not seen the talkie version yet but i think it is safe to assume the silent version is much more satisfying since by all reports the dubbing is poorly done louise brooks is clearly speaking english so there is no way her lips could be matched also the film is made entirely in the silent style with few titles and little need for dialogue prix de beauté tells its story visually with exciting imaginative camerawork the opening is instantly kinetic with rapidlycut scenes of urban life and swimmers splashing at a public beach throughout the film there is an emphasis on visual detail on clothing machinery decoration and symbolic images such as a caged bird a heap of torn photographs a diamond bracelet this is silent film technique at its pinnaclelouise brooks of course is responsible for saving the film from obscurity seeing this makes it only more heartbreaking to reflect that this was her last starring role lustrously beautiful she dominates the film with her charisma and also gives a perfectly natural yet highly charged performance her role here more than in the pabst films for which she is best known is a woman we can fully understand and sympathize with she plays lucienne garnier a typist with a possessive fiancé who yearns to get more out of life and secretly enters a beauty contest with immediate success she is then torn between the excitement of her glamorous new life and her love for the man who insists she give it all up or lose him all of the characters are drawn with nuance the fiancé inspires pity and is not merely a brute he loves lucienne but is a limited man who cannot cope with her having a life apart from him or attracting the attentions of other men even the other man in the story is not the simple slimeball we first take him for though his intentions may be just as possessive as the fiancéswarning spoilers below the film has many fine set pieces including luciennes triumph in the miss europe contest shown through the comic reactions of assorted audience members who wind up pelting the heroine with flowers her misery as a housewife peeling potatoes while the pendulum of the cuckoo clock marks time behind her a nightmarish trip to a funfair in the silent version this occurs late in the film after her marriage at which lucienne crushed among the lowlifes and depressed by her husbands macho antics decides that she cannot go on with her present existence and especially the final scene in the projection room where she views her talkie screen test louise brooks may never have looked more beautiful than she does here with the projectors beam flickering on her alabaster profile her shoulders swathed in white fur her face incandescent under the black helmet of hair as she watches herself singing on screen the double shot of her exquisite corpse and her stillliving image on the screen is particularly poignant louise brooks image like luciennes remains immortal despite her frustratingly aborted film career,1
a really very bad movie with a very few good moments or qualitiesit starts off with pregnant linda blair who runs down a hallways to flee what might be monsters or people with pitchforks i am not sure she jumps through a window and wakes up and we see she is very pregnant the degree to which she is pregnant varies widely throughout the movieshe and an annoying and possibly retarded little boy who i thought was her son travel to an abandoned hotel on an island italian horror directors find the most irritating little boys to put in their movies on the island already are david hasselhoff and his germanspeaking virgin girlfriend you know how germans are said to love hasselhoff he is taking photographs and she is translating an esoteric german book about witches i thinkalso traveling to the island are an older couple who have purchased it and a real estate agent and a woman i thought was their daughter evidently she was an architect and linda blair and the boy are the older couples children i guess they all traveled to the island together but it really seemed like linda and the boy were apart from the rest of them maybe they were filmed separatelythe hotel seems neat certainly from the exteriors but it is not used to any great effect an old woman in bad makeup and a black cloak keeps appearing to the boy and chants something in german sometimes which he eventually records on his sesame street tape recorderpeople start getting killed either in their dreams or sucked into hell or something some of these gore scenes are ok but not enough to recommend the movie though the copy i watched stated it is uncut on the box cover the death of one character whose veins explode really seems to have been cut much of the scene is showing another characters reaction shots since we are not seeing anything ourselves the creepiest scene is one in which a man or demon with a really messylooking wound of a mouth rapes someone he looked particularly nasty there is a laughably and painfully bad scene in which linda blair is possessed i wish if a horror movie is going to cast her they would do something original with her role and let her leave exorcist behind her except for the yearly horror conventionsin the weird largely italian tradition of claiming to be a sequel to something it is unrelated to this is also aka la casa four and ghosthouse two that is it is supposedly a sequel to casa three  ghosthouse la one thousand nine hundred and eightyeight  it is not that is also a better movie than this one la casa one and two were the evil dead one thousand nine hundred and eightyone and evil dead ii one thousand nine hundred and eightyseven  again unrelated to witchery and la casa three and much better than those there is also a casa five la one thousand nine hundred and ninety aka house five which seems to want to be a sequel to the fake la casa series and the series house house one thousand nine hundred and eightysix house ii the second story one thousand nine hundred and eightyseven the horror show one thousand nine hundred and eightynine aka house iii and house iv one thousand nine hundred and ninetytwo how is the horror show fit in there it does not really it claimed to be a sequel thus requiring the real series entry to renumber itself to cause less or more confusion oddly the horror show is also aka horror house and la casa five is also aka horror house two does your head hurt yet,0
i saw brothers shadow at the tribeca film festival and found myself still thinking about it two days later the story of a prodigal son scott cohen returning to his familys custom furniture business after a stint in jail it offers all the necessary qualities of a solid dramamemorable characters sharp observant dialog sensitive use of the camera by a filmmaker who thinks visuallybut more than that it presents something that is all too rare at the multiplex these days the uncompromising vision of a mature sensibility the talent of directorscreenwriter todd s yellin seems to emerge fullblown but we get the sense he like his protagonist has paid his dues he knows how real people struggle in this world and he knows how we yearn to seeor at least to experience vicariouslysuccess yet yellin respects his audience too much to blow happy smoke up our rear ends in the end we see that jakes triumph does not lie in commissions or even in the esteem of his family but in the work he could not abandon if he triedit is an essential theme in a world and especially a movie industry that cannot rise above the bottom line this film deserves a wide audience,1
now what is wrong with the actors that took part in that crap michael dorn should stick to the star treck merchandise john diehl does anyone remember him in miami vice liked him there well whatever  what can one expect from a movie with one of the lifeguards from baywatch in the lead nothing and that is what we get none of the characters is even likable the special effects are hilarious but not funny the story is a very bad joke there is no logic whatsoever for what is happening i got the feeling that the film makers were trying some kind of attack of the killer tomatoes kind of thing especially in the scene where all the important people were discussing national security in some kind of a closetif you happen to see it on tv switch channels  your tv set will be ever thankful,0
how did this ever come into existence i generally love sci fbigfoot whatever films etc   but i still expect them to be written without quite so much cheese as this the effects were sad the lines were sadder avoid at all costs i only ended up renting it because it was in the wrong case i was looking for the sasquatch film with lance henrikson in it  still have not seen that one the idea of the film is actually a good one there was a lot of potential to make a great little movie here i just do not understand how something like this ends up like this go speak to the filmartsenglish interested students in any high school and you will find people who can write a better script,0
i was fascinated as to how truly bad this movie was was the viewer supposed to learn something or reflect on anything here what was up with the pumpkins was i supposed to be impressed with the motel shots does it matter that there are some garbage bags on a rooftop across the street of a hotel why does the narrator unsuccessfully mock the people he interviews it is so obvious that he edited out the really informative parts of his interviews to achieve mockery the best part of the movie was the interview with the film professor who tells us how bad this movie will be even before it is finishedi am truly amazed i believe that the creator is struggling to become an intellectual or is trying to impress the intellectual community,0
this kiyoshi kurosawa ghost movie is pretty wild and it did have at least one jump scare that caught me off guard but all in all the movie is incredibly stupid with a detective trying to track down a suspected serial killer only to find out he may have committed one of the crimes then he finds himself haunted by a gorgeous asian lady ghost and has no idea why and neither does the viewer as other murders are committed he becomes even more confused as the killers are easily found and this ghost still haunts him for some reason not only is the plot completely stupid the lady ghost is more funny than anything especially when she suddenly flies across the city like wonder woman and the ending makes little sense in fact the whole movie makes little sense and i cannot recommend it at all if it did not take itself so serious i would think it was supposed to be a black comedy outside of bright future this is the worst movie directed by kiyoshi kurosawa i have seen yet,0
this film evil breed the legend of samhain contains very little thought or effort it is ridiculed with specs of ultra fast slasher style death and plain disgusting acts of death the acting was rated a d as the actors show very little ability and the stupidity of them in the film is too questionable the way they portrayed what people their ages act like was incredibly different the odd split of porn is fit in thought it really does not offer much and any area that is respectable but is quite quickly run down with absolute gut wrenching death example is the poor fellow whom is disemboweled from his anus and the scene lasts for about five minutes it is terribly obvious of how little of a fight the kids put up this film is a good choice for someone who likes to watch some awful deaths and practically torture,1
horrible waste of time  bad acting plot directing this is the most boring movie ever there are bad movies that are fun freddy vs jason and there are bad movies that are horrible this one fits into the latter bottom line  do not waste your time,0
this is by far the worst movie i have ever seen i can honestly say i have never seen a movie worse than this oneand i mean neveri am a big fan of b horror movies as you may imagine i have been exposed to some of worst that the movie industry has to offeri was lured to this movie by it is title i mean cmon what true fan of horror would not be intrigued by a title like vampires vs zombies images of the undead battling each other to the undeath danced in my head i thought to myself this i have got to seewell sorry to say this i wish i had not seenthis movies title is very misleading to say the least there was no vampires fighting zombies in fact there is no plot if you were to ask me what this movie is all about i could honestly tell you i have no ideathere was no plot there was no story this movie absolutely makes no sense at allat the end of this debacle i found myself feeling sorry for the poor souls who had invested their money into this project for they surely have no business sense,0
i had heard and read so many good things about weeds that i was looking forward to getting hooked on another great cable series like entourage sopranos or mad men but that slowly eroded away with each episode i watched from season one did not make it past the first six episodes the writing was unoriginal contrived and the portrayal of blacks embarrassing the dialog felt forced like the writers are trying way too hard to be clever and hip  it was a rare moment when i actually emitted an audible laughthe characters never developed enough for me to care about them they were selfish and unappealing i absolutely hated the addition of the brotherinlaw who should have been hauled away on to catch a predator and the removal of the hodes daughter quinn from the cast by sending her to boarding school in mexico was so unoriginal and cliché i had to conclude the writers were testing the viewers loyaltyepisode after episode i liked the characters less and could not get past many of the technical flaws in the story lineadd to that i heard that season two was not as good so i lost all motivation to continue to watch this play outif you are a fan of good casting and writing i suspect this show will be a challenge for you to like unless of course you are stoned and then all bets are off,0
a childless couple brooke adams jeff hayenga go to a doctor james karen to try to conceive it works but adams slowly becomes aware that there is something seriously wrong with the babypretty interesting idea is thoroughly done in by a lousy scriptthe basic idea is ok but becomes screamingly predictable towards the end i saw every twist coming the direction is poorhe seems to have no idea how to shoot a basic scene the production values areto be nicelousy very shabby and the gore scenes are too unpleasant i almost turned it off when a pregnant woman started stabbing herself in the stomach with lousy special effects the film completely derails at the end when it becomes quite clear they had no idea how to end this filmsome good acting makes it somewhat bearable adams hayenga and karen are all good at their roles and kept me watching but that was about it this film barely got released in one thousand nine hundred and ninetyone and still remains unknownit is easy to see why i give it a four,0
featuring a fascinating performance by will smith and a story that tugs at your heartstrings harder than a rock guitarist midsolo seven pounds races past the directors previous collaboration with the actor the pursuit of happiness a flick which i also loved remember gabriele muccinos name because some of his movies may skip by unnoticed if the actor attached to the project is not quite so highprofile too bad i figured out will smiths scheme early on i put two and two together when he calls in his own suicide in the first scene and the scene when rosario dawsons character is introduced as having an incurable heartdiseasehowever i still think the writerdirector made the right choice putting the bookends bookends are the first and the last scene in that way it is the source of urgency and tension in the movie finding out gradually how exactly a man can be driven to that ultimate sacrifice and it was heartbreaking to see the relationship between smiths and dawsons character flourish and develop knowing in the back of the mind always what was in store for these unlucky twoone of my friends with whom i saw the movie thought smiths character could have a divine gift and i understand why his performance is almost angelic when in the presence of his seven elected ones yet at other times he could be harsh and scary and when he is alone the full weight of his situation got too much for him and he breaks down completely it is quite a versatile performancelastly i cannot forget to mention the crash scene reenactment which was really quite stunningly done in terms of cinematography paired with music put this on your list,1
when will the hurting stop i never want to see another version of a christmas carol again they keep on making movies with the same story falling over each other in trying to make the movie better then the rest but sadly fail to do so as this is not a good story moralistic oldfashioned conservative happythinking as if people learn the numerous different versions of this film prove that we don´t,0
you know you are in trouble when john cassavetes is operating at halfspeed instead of fullthrottle in a movie and the incubus is a dreadful worstcase scenario of a great actor going through the motions to pay the bills actually observing the hammy script and john houghs baroque art direction one can hardly blame him the movie has something to do with a series of rapemurders going on in a small town with a lot of supernatural hokum mixed in somehow the direction manages to suck tension and interest out of every scene and cassavetes seems visibly poed at times the incubus itself which does not show up until the last scene is a welldone creation but it is not worth waiting foroneten,0
before i watched this film i read a review here stating that this film could possibly be one of the best films ever ha ha scene by scene the tension grows alright from the annoying characters in this movie from the little girl talking gibberish and trying to drown the little boy to the killer just running about without any notice and who was the guy at the beach talking to the little boythings just seem to happen and then go unanswered in this film as i watched it seemed like the film was going in one direction then just does not go anywhere but into a new directionand on and onthe acting is great but the writing is horrible each character in each scene says or does something so unbelievable unrealistic and the reactions of the fellow castextras are simply strange there are no resolutions to the problems developed throughout the film making it confusing and ultimately a big waste of time,0
wow what an episode after last week seeing mellisa constantly making cameos about the friendship of annie and brandi i almost puked but that was nothing until seeing mellisas tirade after being fired seeing her hobble around on her cast spewing out obscenities and screaming for someone to get her purse was absolutely the most hilarious thing ever on reality tv she continued to scream at people off set to get her clothes all of them like someone else would wear one of her hideous outfits mellisa you are like forty years old and you still throw temper tantrums then joan starts calling annie and brandie every name in the book and gets up and quits the show both rivers are spoiled brats who were only left on the show this long to keep ratings up mellisa crying and refusing to do an exit interview just proves to america what everyone thought you are a spoiled baby wah wah i cannot get my way i love how annie told the cameras she could manipulate mellisa to think her way and then did exactly that mellisa is by far the smartest contestant and clearly deserves to win the whole game,1
this movie was made by a bunch of white guys that went to school together well there is nothing wrong with that except it looks like it was made by a bunch of white guys that went to school together ninety percent of the cast are white males about same age it is almost like watching a bunch of guys at boys camp who turned the camera on themselves the movie has no plot it simply repeats the same action of blood bath after blood bath there are some funny scenes and comedic bits but they do not redeem the flat monotonythe graphic cartoon scenes are used to cover the stuff that was obviously beyond their budget or resources to do and not done very well at that anything that cannot be done with white guys running around on the beach covered in blood is done with cheap animationi went to see this film after seeing the trailer which makes it look like a tarrentino piece well the trailer scenes are as good as they ever get ther rest of it just repeats the same kind of mundane inane comedy it works at times but it gets boring after the same stuff comes at you over and over it is more like a string of satuday night live skits than a movie it is a hityouovertheheadwithit kind of comedy i can see where the story idea is intriguing but in this film post apocalyptic america is much like medevil england in fact wheatlry says the story ideas came from that era he plans to make a part two i guess he thinks he is tarrentino or maybe doing a parody thingat the opening in la wheatley mentioned he will bring back pretty much the same cast in part two he was asked if he might consider a more diverse cast in the next one to which he replied well yea sure,0
i had to watch this film because the plot was so outrageous and the film lived up to expectations in fact it makes for quite uncomfortable viewing at times unlike other meyer films the sexual antics are down to a minimum some of the scenes of violence are unnecessarily gratuitous and offensive the plot is chaotic and some of the acting and lines are dreadfulthe film is a strange combination of sadomasochistic fantasy combined with a window of the brutality and immorality of the slavery and fails on all counts it is as though meyer was trying to make up for the sexploitation blackploitation by having a higher moral message meyer knows we feel a bit guilty about getting turned on by the blatant dominatrix connotations of the early scene showing lady susan wielding a whip in a provocative outfit he then tries to steer back to the righteous path by turning it into a film about the triumph of good over evil however because they cancel each other out you end up with nothingbecause it so bad in so many ways it is actually worth watching if you appreciate the art of making an awful film in the worst possible taste perhaps because it is so bad we almost let meyer get away with the unacceptable,0
once upon a time there was a charming land called france people lived happily then the women were easy and the men indulged in their favorite pastime war the only recreation of kings which the people could enjoy the war in question was the seven years war and when it was noticed that there were more corpses of soldiers than soldiers recruiters were sent out to replenish the ranks and so it was that fanfan gerard philipe caught tumbling a farmers daughter in a pile of hay escapes marriage by enlisting in the regiment daquitanebut only by first believing his future as foretold by a gypsy that he will win fame and fortune in his majestys uniform and will marry the kings daughter alas adeline gina lollobrigida is not a gypsy but the daughter of the regiments recruiting sergeant when fanfan charges away from the recruits saber in hand to rescue a carriage under attack who should be inside but the marquise du pompadour andthe kings daughter he now is convinced he will marry high despite the extremely lowcut blouses adeline wears she in turn will soon discover her own love for fanfan we are in the middle of an irreverent movie of fanfans destiny the ribald adventures of a swordfighting scamp and rogue there are escapes from hangings swordfights on tile roofs blundering battles romantic escapes and more joyous derring do than you can imagine what fanfan lacks in polish he makes up for in irreverence and enthusiasm he is a quick stepping swordsman and a fasttalking lover but with such naïve belief in his destiny and such an optimistic nature how can we not like him gerard philipe was an iconic stage and screen actor who francois truffaut disparaged constantly in the pages of cahiers du cinema he did most of his own stunts he was handsome athletic graceful and charismatic men admired him and women dreamed about him he was dead at thirtysix seven years after fanfan of liver cancer all of france mourned gina lollobrigida as adeline holds her own it is not those lowcut blouses that do her acting she is sharp passionate not quite innocent and no ones fool fanfan la tulipe just sings along with endless satiric action pointed situations and good nature not to mention amusing acerbic dialogue after adeline has taken steps to save fanfan from hanging she meets the king in his private quarters give me your pretty little hand he says but my heart belongs to fanfan says adeline who asks for your heart says the king all i ask for is a little pleasure i am a proper girl says adeline says the king you owe my esteem to your merits you love fanfan then thank me my whims enable you to show the greatest proof of your love by betraying for his sake the loyalty you have sworn him now this is clever funny stuff jeanluc godard francois truffaut and the rest of the new wave gang tended to detest popular movies as mere entertainment and they personalized their attacks fanfan la tulipe and its director christianjacques were among their prime targets they probably missed the point of fanfan which is a very funny satire on the pointlessness of armies and war how much better it must have seemed to make movies of angst which only fellow cineastes could appreciate thank goodness some of them truffaut and chabrol for example outgrew this childish condescension and came to recognize that a good movie is a good movie whether the masses like it or just the cognoscenti a smart person who enjoys movies can appreciate any if the movies are well made those who condescend to a movie based on its degree of popularity are as selfdemeaning as those who brag they have never read harry potter jeanluc godard eat your heart out viva fanfan,1

ripoff of a dozen better films particularly steven martins la story which at least had the grace to be obviously fictional even though it starred his thengirlfriend playing his girlfriend in the filmyes naive boys and girls twenty dates is a mockumentary although i am not absolutely certain that was myles berkowitzs intent when he started my impression is that he started the project semiseriously then quickly realized that it would be pathetic and not funny unless he made the situations more and more ridiculous as a result the whole thing has an uneasy cheap and insincere feeling about itas someone smartly pointed out the film has two of the dates suing and putting restraining orders on myles and yet they appear in the film which would be impossible as it would require a consent form it also appears to me that the majority of women who appear as the dates are professional actresses albiet not famous ones excepting tina carrere  they are simply too obviously pretty polished thin and comfortable in front of the camera to be average civiliansmr berkowitz makes a classic error in only casting this kind of very pretty thin actress instead of utilizing a variety of believable women which might have made the premise even in a mockumentary more believable and funnier he also skates over what is probably his realworld problem and which is that both the movie character and the real world myles berkowitz appear to be functionally unemployed his real life imdb credits are practically nonexistent excepting this film even in the world of the movie his exwife divorced him for never being employed i think the viewer let alone mr berkowitzs real life dates are deserving of an explanation of he manages to live in one of the most expensive urban environments in the us in a luxury apartment driving a fancy car and eating out at pricey restaurants when he does not seen to have any source of income whatsoever is he drug dealer living off his rich parents no clueyou can get away with most anything in a film if the jokes are really funny twenty dates is painfully embarrassingly unfunny mr berkowitzs idea of a joke is to have his character while on restaurant dates announce to his companions how the food served is likely to give him either diarrhea or constipation  the worst kind of childish potty humorit is not very surprising to discover that mr berkowitz never made a film before twenty dates and in the last eight years has not made a single film appeared as an actor in anyone elses film or had a writing or producing credit of any kind my gut instinct tells me that this film was not financed by elie the gangster money man who appears offcamera but more likely by mr berkowitzs affluent parents or perhaps represents a shocking abuse of credit cards whichever it was we can all rest easy that we are unlikely to have to see myles berkowitz or any of his creative efforts ever again hallelujah,0
probably encouraged by admirers of her muchbetter orlando potter here delivers a vehicle for herself in the worst way she writes directs stars and actually cowrites the music including a mawkish love song the film strongly resembles a high school or college project by a teenager convinced that her own intimate loves and melodramatic obsessions are as fascinating to us as to her but potters character is as unsympathetic as the object of her romantic obsession is unlikable and the whole film is an embarrassing display of narcissism masquerading as a celebration of the tango perhaps if she had not cast herself it might have worked she just cannot act whether playing herself or not pretentious overambitious dull and silly,0
what is very french about this film is the time taken to establish the two leading characters this might require a bit of patience especially since neither is attractive in the typical hollywood definition of such however once the heist kicks in the film rushes forward quickly perhaps at times too quickly but it is a real rollercoaster ride and if you do not look too closely it is all quite believable the kind of film that you know hollywood would have botched up,1
kate beckinsale steals the show bravo too bad knightly inst as good looking as jeremy northam mark strong did a fabulous job bernard hepton was perfect as emmas father i love the end scene which is an addition to the novelbut well written when the harvest is in and knightly dines with his workers and high society friends emma must show that she accepts this now she is a changed woman that is too much too quick but ok i will buy into it samantha bond plays emmas exgoverness and confidant she is wonderful just as i would have imagined her i believe that when the uk does a jane austen its the best american versions of english literature are done for money and not for quality see this one,1
okay i will admit the casting in the film is really strangepart of this is due to the plot but i still had a bit of trouble believing pierce brosnan playing this lead though he really did a pretty good jobit is based on a true story of an englishman who went to live with the canadian indians in the early twentyth century he claimed to be a mixed blood indian he was in fact so successful and well thought of that people came from all over to hear his lectures and be taken on his wilderness trekseven though he was not a mixed blood indian and all his knowledge was from books or faked the movie centers on this and what occurred when the hoax was uncoveredthe acting and settings were great and i really liked the film once i suspended disbelief about brosnan it did not get widespread distributionprobably because it was pretty cerebralnot a bond film nor a romancejust a really odd film about a remarkable man,1
after highlander two which i am still in denial about i thought is was impossible to make a sequel that could make me cry because it was so bad i was wrong i loved the original wargames however this movie is inaccurate with computer details and details about the original movie the original wargames at least had some hacks that worked whoever wrote this movie knew nothing about computers except how to use a word processor i doubt he or she even watched the original movie the acting is not even convincing please save yourselves under no circumstances watch this movie i do not care if the channel is stuck on the tv and you cannot turn the tv off this movie will ruin your life,0

diagnosis murder has been shown on most weekday afternoons on bbcone since i used to watch it while ill from school a good ten years ago  i know i should not really enjoy it in the same way i should not enjoy murder she wrote but i am totally addicted to both and even have the dvd boxsetsok i know that is saddick van dyke carries the show as he stars as drmark sloan a doctor at community general hospital in la who is also a police consultant for the lapd  his son steve barry van dyke  dicks real life son is a police officer who needs his fathers help on very many suspicious deaths along for the ride is dramanda bentley victoria bentley the resident pathologist at community general and for the first couple of seasons you had scott baio playing drjack stewart who upped and left the series in one thousand nine hundred and ninetyfive hoping to go on to bigger and better thingshe should have stayed where he was he has not done anything of note sinceand his only theatrical appearance for many years was in baby geniuses twosuperbabiesoh dearanyhow drjack stewart was replaced by the younger drjesse travis played by charlie schlatter who stepped into baios shoes pretty comfortablythe series is highly implausible but what whodunit series is not murder she wrote  everywhere jessica goes someone ends up dead or the underrated father dowling mysteries about a murder solving priest with nun sidekickthe series was much lighter up until one thousand nine hundred and ninetyseven this is because it had a supporting cast that included the bumbling hospital manager norman briggs played by michael tucci along with nurse  marks secretary dolores played by delores hall after one thousand nine hundred and ninetyseven both these characters were no longer included and the series became a grittier affair with a bigger looking budget some episodes included far more action one episode the entire hospital is blown upthis was a family show for the van dykes because as well as dicks son barry you also had dicks daughter and all his grandchildren making an appearance in various episodes as the series went on it got a bit silly one episode i remember dick van dike plays his entire family which was a bit out of the ordinary but on the whole diagnosis murder was a really good tv show which had numerous good guest starssince this show finished in two thousand and one dick  barry have appeared together again in the murder one hundred and one series of tv movies made by the hallmark channel pretty much following the same path and still enjoyable dick who is now in his mid eightys does not seem to change a great deal and looks as if he will be working till the bitter endtv show  out of ,1

i think this is almost all i need to say i feel obliged to explain my actions though i have basically never seen such an armature production and i mean that in all senses of the word although he physical camera work boom mic operation and other technical aspects of this film are laughable unfortunately its not the only areas unlike some classic independent films that have been saved by their scripts great characterization and plot this unfortunately has an awful script awful acting and worst of all awful annoying characters it is a crime that for the every independent film that gets distribution like haiku tunnel there is a one hundred and one other indie films that died silent deaths i do not know who the kornbluth brothers know at sony but that can be my only explanation as to how this amateur family production ever got distribution i am quite bemused as to why they picked this upthe only part of this film that holds out any intrigue is its title however the reason for that is even a let down i hope this review will save a few people that may be intrigued by this films title from going to watch it i have seen a lot of films in my time and i am very forgiving when in the cinema but this was too much i will never forget tunnel for marking an important point in my life experience of cinema shame it is such a low point,0
i think everyone was quite disappointed with this scifi flick for one thing it was directed by tim burton another thing it is a remake of what is supposed to be a classic i found it boring gross and ridiculous if you have seen it you know what i mean just about everyone at imdb say it is crap and boy are they right if you have not avoid it it is a snorer one out of ten,0
just because is one of those films that at first makes you wonder quite why it was so heavily slated when it came out  nothing special but competent enough and with an excellent supporting performance from ed harris then you hit the last third and everything starts to get increasingly silly until you have got a killer with a flashlight strapped to his forehead threatening to fillet sean connerys wife a typically mannered and unconvincing kate capshaw and kid a very young scarlet johannsen in an alligator skinners shack the kind of movie that is probably best seen on a plane and even then only once,0
dressed to kill is one of the best thrillers ever made its dealings with sex and violence make this a film for adults brian de palma once again proves why no other director can match his use of the camera to tell a story he directs many scenes without dialog and he tells much of his story strictly through the use of his visuals and pino donnagios brilliant score filmed in panavision the film must be seen in widescreen as de palma uses the entire width of the film to tell his story cropped on video dressed to kill is barely the same movie solid performances from its cast superb direction and perhaps the finest film score ever written make dressed to kill a must see,1
i just want to say that this production is very one sided breaks the impartiality needed if you want to be taken seriously there are no credits of the persons they interviewed so you cannot have an idea if they are worthy of being heardtells the story from just one point of view to do this is very dangerous because the next generations learns the bad idea and that is why wars keep coming i know this is not the only reason about wars but does not help eitheryou can watch this documentary but read in the internet a lot before balcans are complex as human history is,0
this movie is an eye opener for those who can only the glamorous lifestyles of the stars it tells you how people who would like to do good are not able to plus the bomb blast scene is very realwhat you read and are taught just does not happencan raise your bp level by tenall actors played their role very wellsome scenes may  could have been avoided to include teenagersthis movie is quite adult in naturenot a movie that can be seen with familycasting is great,1
steve mcqueen has certainly a lot of loyal fans out there he certainly was a charismatic fellow one of the most charismatic the big screen ever knew but even mcqueen cannot save this turkey of a film shot with what looks like a brownie camera in the actual locations in st louismcqueens a new kid with no criminal record brought into the planning of a bank heist by one of the other gang there is more than a broad hint that there is a gay relationship going on between young steve and david clarke he is not liked at all by the other heist members mainly because of his lack of criminal resume steve also has a girl friend in molly mccarthy and she suspects something afoot especially when he starts hanging around with crahan denton and james dukas as well as clarke all pretty rough characters that would certainly get my suspicions arousedthe great st louis bank robbery had two directors charles guggenheim and john stix guggenheim did mostly documentaries and stix did not do much of anything one of those two jokers decided steves performance was best served by doing a bad marlon brando imitation this film may go down as the worst ever done by steve mcqueen i am willing to bet that dick powell and four star productions had already signed him for wanted dead or alive because i cannot believe they would have if they saw thisor they would have seen something the public would have overlooked except for the dressing for this turkey,0

this is the worst movie i ever paid to see and with the exception of they saved hitlers brain the worst movie i have ever seen period when this movie came out i was a big fan of snl and sctv and therefore was anticipating what i thought would be the funniest movie that could be produced since it did not have the restrictions the tv improv shows must deal with the writers must have thought we will throw in some grossness some flatulence jokes some cheap sex and hey we have a risky side splitting laughable comedy the game show skits are nothing more than cheap unimaginable take offs on let us make a deal with stupid grossness the sit com take off involving the single girl and her boyfriend was just plain bad high school humor the stun gun advertisement was suitable humor for seasame street the la subway skit was bland humor using tasteless bloodiness the french chef walking around blind constantly uttering there is no difference with a french accent was well you get my pointthe only funny skit involved chevy chase which lasted for a whole minute this means you get sixty seconds of entertainment in this movie oh yea i have read the comments about the entire country being stoned in the one thousand nine hundred and seventys and you will like this movie if you are high well most of the country was not stoned in the seventys if the inept writers were stoned it must have been on drowsy sinus medicine there were four other people in the theater besides myself when i saw this movie of course word did not get out yet about how bad the movie was,0
i enjoyed this film very muchtobey maguire gives a terrific performance as jake he has got to be one of the best actors i have seen and i was surprised there were so many humorous lines throughout the film he was extremely good at this too although i have never seen him deliver a comic line before the film gets you involved with the characters and really makes you wonder what is to become of them all i did not know what to expect from jewels performance but i think she did rather well lots of exciting scenes a thoroughly good ride i am absolutely a fan of maguires check out cider house rules one of the all time best ever,1
it really impresses me that it got made the directorwriteractor must be really charismatic in reality i can think of no other way it would pass script stage what i want you to consider is thiswhile watching the films i was feeling sorry for the actors it felt like being in a stand up comedy club where the guy is dying on his feet and your sitting there not enjoying it just feeling really bad for him coz hes of trying id really like to know what the budget is guess it must have been low as the film quality is really poor i want to write the jokes did not appeal to me but the reality is for them to appeal to you you would have to be the man who wrote them or a retard so imagine that in script formand this guy got that green lit that is impressive is not it,0
really an amazing pile of pap a predictable slow moving soul destroying mind numbing movie to which slitting your own wrists with a rusty bread knife seems well almost necessarythe acting is over done for the thin dialogue every scene is at least twice as long as it needs to be the intricate details of how this career is collapsing or that career is rising is just far too dreary and mundane for words the music would be good if you did not have to sit through the movie but really three good songs is not enough reward for the effort required to watch the moviewatching this film i prayed to god for narcolepsy or for someone to shoot menever ever ever again,0
the us state dept would not like us to see this movie because they have a beef with the iranian govt however it shows us just how civilized iran really is despite the content of the film which centers on the struggle of women there for equal rights in the simplest of terms the ability to watch a soccer game at the stadium which is strictly limited to male audiences alone the film is hilariously funny and in and of itself is proof of freedom of speech and expression in iran i enjoyed this movie intensely five girls try to penetrate the police border at the ticket gates to a soccer match between iran and bahrain the ensuing comedy is too funny to describe from the bus trip to the stadium to the interceding of the police and subsequent detention of the girls to the resulting end do not miss this classic film its a must see one of the best foreign films i have seen in years,1
i have to admit i have always found it difficult to watch an antonioni film from start to finish at the first try and even for this one i ended up watching it in three parts on repeated occasions in the end i realised perhaps it was better that way because it forced me to stop thinking in the usual terms of plot and just enjoy the scenes one by one the first part seems a lot more fragmentary which is not a bad thing it just requires more of an effort to follow when it gets to the desert scenes all efforts are repaid in full the stunning cinematography is only a part of it what really makes it all unforgettable is how the landscape is made into an overwhelming presence the silence and vastness of it the sense of sadness and freedom the way it fuses and contrasts with the two young characters the desert is dead but at the same time it feels less distant and alien than the urban scenes in the first part the dance between the airplane flying over and the girls car makes for a series of great shots the love scenes in the desert are simply beautiful it is hard to imagine this kind of approach from a film of our times there is of course something very stylish and studied about them but at the same time they manage to express a sense of natural spontaneous innocence that is very rare these days it all feels loose and unscripted thanks also to the understated acting but that is the result of a maniacal attention to detail and form which comes to its climax in the series of explosions at the end a really mesmerising spectacle it just leaves you in awei do not really care for some the usual objections boring  well yes it is if you want all films to follow a classic plot development and be packed with action twists but then if all cinema was like that that would be truly dull and sad pretentious  maybe but when that kind of ambitiousness is coupled with actual skills depth and style pretentious is a compliment the political criticisms make the least sense to me i do not see the point of approaching a film like this with ideological blinders or worse patriotic requirements it just defeats the purpose perhaps it is true that like a previous commenter remarked antonioni viewed these young hippies and the politics of protests and riots with the police with the fascination of a foreigner but i think that adds something rather than detracting from the film it is not true that hippies did not exist in italy at the time think of the sixtyeight protests like in france although they were obviously different from the american counterpart and in some ways even more militant but his interest in this film was not narrowly political the events seem more like a pretext for a film whose appeal has a universal timeless qualitya special mention for the fantastic soundtrack amongst other things this film along with easy rider is probably one of the main earliest precursors of the contemporary artsy music video as well as the concept of a film soundtrack that would stand on its own but unlike the former it uses music in a much more subtle way blending it with the landscape rather than the action if you want traditional narrative in a film then do not bother if you want to be stunned be patient and you will not regret it,1
