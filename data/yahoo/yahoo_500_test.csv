9,i am sure they are aware but a lot of the immigrants or illegals as some refer to them do not really feel they are breaking the law since they only come here to work to send money to their families and are in no way committing crimesi think they see it as i am here illegally i am working a demeaning job with no ladder going up how can i be hurting the us when it is citizens who are paying me less then minimum wage are benefiting i am not a criminal here to steal or murder anyonennabove dork they run from cops because of the brutality in which they are arrested and treatednot to mention the money they worked hard for to pay to get over here they have to somehow manage to stay here long enough to make that upi am sure the us government would love it if they had alaw against illegal runners so that they the gov could get that money to let the undocumented come in but of course that would in turn make them runnersthey are just trying to find a way to manage to get to that point legally and it seems with partcially informed citizens it might happeni gues you are all for building that mockery of the great wall of chinathere was a time in america when everyone was welcomed and never turned awayremember most of us here in the us are not natives from here we all came from different countries and regions it is how america was made

7,some technical elementsnnone use of deep focus  deep focus allowed the camera to see the background as sharply as the foreground welles made good use of this nnfor example in the scene where susan tries to kill herself welles implies to us what she did in just one shot because you can see the medicine bottle in the foreground susan lying down in the midground and the locked door in the background this all implies that she tried to kill herself if welles did not use deep focus such a shot and such economy of shots would be impossiblenntwo jump cuts  you can see this in the scene where kane says merry christmas to thatcher then it cuts to a scene many years later where thatcher says and a happy new yearnnwelles used jump cuts creatively in this film such as the example above it is a joy to see how freshly he uses jump cuts and other techniques in this film even though the movie is decades oldnnsome symbolismnnone when came walks past the hall of mirrors i think the image shows us how many faces kane had in his life and which one is the real kane who knows nntwo when the smoke rises to the sky during the last shots of the movie i think the shot is saying to us look kane had so much possessions in his life but so what all of it is fleeting just like that smoke

0,one could say the same for advertising or sports or just about anything nnpicking up religion and examining every misuse of it is not the right way to look at religion if a butterfly falls in your cup of coffee and make it undrinkable would we conclude that butterflies were created to spoil coffee nnbutterflies do much more than die in cups of coffee and coffee is rendered undrinkable for a hundred other reasonsnnthe point is nitpicking on religion is not logical i am not poor religion gives me hope too that should kill this line of argument nnreligion is not something that people invented in the past one thousand five hundred years to kill each other religion is a way to understand life  the totality of life there are many problems with applied religion the biggest one is that people are selective in following religion and then blame it all on faithnna writer once said that cultures are not based on customs cultures are different based on how people answer the question about life and after life in other words how people answer the questions who am i where did i come from what am i doing here where will i go when i die what will happen therennto me that is also the definition of religion a set of answers to the above questions to apply such a big thing on individual examples is misunderstanding religion secondly if people behave in this world as if there is no tomorrow and someone else suffers from their acts  why blame it on any faithnnreligion esp abrahamic faiths are much much more than getting fascinated with nature in abrahamic tradition that is just the beginning prophet abraham started with observing nature and was disappointed that the stars moon and the sun all vanished so he said if this thing sets it cannot be my god nngod and religion are larger than people trying to use them as some kinds of solutions to everyday problems without changing the fundamental mindset  without answering these five questions above  one cannot understand and practice religion and cannot blame the human faults on god

9,i am not of the jewish faith i do not live in israel i am not palestinian i do not live in palestine and i am not an arabnnif you look at my questions you will see that there are some very interesting answers  some rather pompous and some misinterpreting my question and details entirely  so many people are judgemental is it any wonder that the grave problems between the israeli jews and the palestinians have made no progress whatsoevernnthe palistinians know of no other way to fight for their existance against the most technically superior and heavily armed force in the middle east  israel  nnwhat other action can they resort to now that will enable them to live freely and justly in the country they reside in other than sacrificing themselves as human bombs  nnit is tragic that in the twentyonest century the political men in the world are incapable of having the courage to produce a solution that will enable palistinians and israelis to integrate justly and with compassion  nni know for a fact that the attitude of the israeli police and border guards to palistinians is nothing short of arrogant  even to a british subject on vacation palistinians gueue from twozero am to cross checkpoints to get to work by ninezero am  what kind of treatment is that and what kind of behaviour is that nnthe palistinians organised what was acknowledged as a democratic election  the only problem was that the democratically elected party was not the party which other proplecountries wanted  nnthe big mistake the democratically elected hamas government made was not to renounce terrorism  what it should have done was to form their own defence force in uniform under the authority of the government made up of those who are trying to preserve the human rights of their fellow men women and children  so blatently abused by israel  evidenced by un resolutions which are ignored by israelnnare we expected to forget the virtual wipeout of lebanon by israel just weeks ago  that seems to have disappeared from the media  and one has to ask why  although i suspect we all know that money talks in politicsnnmy emotions are mixed  i really would like to think that all the inhabitants of the land called israel and palestine could live together side by side in peace  nnthe israelis may have suffered deaths at the hands of the palistinian suicide bombers but the palistinians have also suffered death by israeli military forces in addition to the  loss of their livelihoods and their farmland  at least the israelis can go about their daily lives and employment  something denied to the palistinians by the israelis

0,undoubtedly one of the hottest areas of debate in discussions between christians and muslims is the christians dogma of the trinity almost invariably muslims are convinced that christians believe in three separate deities whilst christians are adamant in affirming their absolute commitment to monotheism without question the concept of the triune deity  indeed the whole doctrine of god  is difficult to understand but this difficulty is unnecessarily accentuated if an uninformed or incorrect view of christian dogma is held by muslims the purpose of this paper is to set the record straight and also to compare and contrast aspects of the doctrine of god in both religions

3,i just recently changed careers so i am not in education any longer  however i do have some insight into your question  i think the biggest problem is the lack of equity in how money is given out to schools in a given district  the yous department of education gives out money based on a formula and the state divvies it out  nnironically schools in districts where the poorer kids live have broken down schools with out dated books doors coming off the hinges leaky roofs and other conditions that can inhibit a student’s ability to learn  then you look at schools in more affluent neighborhoods and they have schools that look like a castle and have better equipment and supplies  nnwho makes the decisions about what schools get treated better  somehow it makes it hard for a principal to help teachers and students when he is not getting a fair share of the pie  students in poor districts deserve to learn just as much as the kids in the rich neighborhoods  but why is there such a difference in the quality of their schools and accompanying supplies    until that question is honestly answered we will forever have a big learning problem in american education nnthis is what i think based on what i have observed

1,antimatter or contraterrene matter is matter that is composed of the antiparticles of those that constitute normal matter if a particle and its antiparticle come in contact with each other the two annihilate and produce a burst of energy which results in the production of other particles and antiparticles or electromagnetic radiation in these reactions rest mass is not conserved although as in any other reaction energy emc² is conservednnnin one thousand nine hundred and twentyeight paul dirac developed a relativistic equation for the electron now known as the dirac equation curiously the equation was found to have negative energy solutions in addition to the normal positive ones this presented a problem as electrons tend toward the lowest possible energy level energies of negative infinity are nonsensical as a way of getting around this dirac proposed that the vacuum can be considered a sea of negative energy the dirac sea any electrons would therefore have to sit on top of the seannthinking further dirac found that a hole in the sea would have a positive charge at first he thought that this was the proton but hermann weyl pointed out the hole should have the same mass as the electron the existence of this particle the positron was confirmed experimentally in one thousand nine hundred and thirtytwo by carl d andersonnntodays standard model shows that every particle has an antiparticle for which each additive quantum number has the negative of the value it has for the normal matter particle the sign reversal applies only to quantum numbers properties which are additive such as charge but not to mass for example the positron has the opposite charge but the same mass as the electron an atom of antihydrogen is composed of a negativelycharged antiproton being orbited by a positivelycharged positron nnotationnphysicists need a notation to distinguish particles from antiparticles one way is to denote an antiparticle by adding a bar or macron over the symbol for the particle for example the proton and antiproton are denoted as  and  respectivelynnanother convention is to distinguish particles by their electric charge thus the electron and positron are denoted simply as e− and e adding a bar over the e symbol would be redundant and is not donennantimatter as fuelnin antimattermatter collisions the entire rest mass of the particles is converted to energy the energy per unit mass is about ten orders of magnitude greater than chemical energy and about two orders of magnitude greater than nuclear energy that can be liberated today using chemical reactions or nuclear fissionfusion the reaction of one kg of antimatter with one kg of matter would produce oneeight×one thousand and seventeen j one hundred and eighty petajoules of energy by the equation emc² in contrast burning a kilogram of gasoline produces fourtwo×one hundred and seven j and nuclear fusion of a kilogram of hydrogen would produce twosix×one thousand and fifteen j not all of that energy can be utilized by any realistic technology because as much as fifty of energy produced in reactions between nucleons and antinucleons is carried away by neutrinos so for all intents and purposes it can be considered losttwonnthe scarcity of antimatter means that it is not readily available to be used as fuel although it could be used in antimatter catalyzed nuclear pulse propulsion generating a single antiproton is immensely difficult and requires particle accelerators and vast amounts of energy—millions of times more than is released after it is annihilated with ordinary matter due to inefficiencies in the process known methods of producing antimatter from energy also produce an equal amount of normal matter so the theoretical limit is that half of the input energy is converted to antimatter counterbalancing this when antimatter annihilates with ordinary matter energy equal to twice the mass of the antimatter is liberated—so energy storage in the form of antimatter could in theory be one hundred efficient antimatter production

9,both major parties have individuals who lean left or right especially on particular issues  liberals lean left or even far left  conservatives lean right or even far right  moderates are middle of the road on most issues and are present in both parties  there are also independents who are not a party and are not loyal to either party  they may be individuals who are even more left or right of center  being left or right often refers to the fact that political bodies such as congress are seated such that one party is together on the left of an aisle and the other party is on their rightnnliberals and conservatives often agree that something needs to be done but often not how to do it or who should pay for itnnperhaps welfare is a good example  both liberals and conservatives support welfare however liberals allowed the system to reach the point where many people believed that the government owed then a living while conservatives saw it as a bridge over troubled circumstances back to selfsufficiency  welfare case workers feared losing their jobs if they did not maintain a long client list while others wondered why a lowpaid worker should pay taxes to support a person who could work  finding the happy medium the job of the moderates is often difficulty

1,therapeutic cloning also known as somatic cell nuclear transfer cell nuclear replacement research cloning and embryo cloning involves taking an egg or oocyte from which the nucleus has been removed and replacing that nucleus with dna from the cell of another organism the result is a blastocyst an early stage embryo with about one hundred cells with almost identical dna to the original organismnnthe procedure is controversial and this is reflected in the language used to describe the blastocyst created some people believe it should not be called a blastocyst or embryo since it has not been created by fertilisation but others maintain that since given the right conditions it could still grow into a fetus and eventually a child it does not seem misleading to call it an embryonthe aim of carrying out this procedure is to obtain stem cells that are genetically matched to the donor organism for example if a person with parkinsons disease donated their dna then it should be theoretically possible to generate embryonic stem cells that could be used to treat their condition without being rejected by the patients immune system

6,the psychology of the matter is this because when people are on the internet there is no face to face communication they can remain as anonymous as they desire hence such persons feel none of the inhibitions that are normally imposed by society on what is considered proper etiquette in conversation besides receiving rude words in return there is no fear of severe consequences such as getting their face busted nor do they have to see the facial expressions of the hurt they because most people like this have poorly developed social skills to begin with either they are boorish cads and their behavior is amplified by the nature of the internet or they have pentup anger that they are afraid to display in public and lash out on the internet people like this need to be dealt with firmly but as the scriptures say answer a fool according to his folly answer not a fool according to his folly in other words expose such people as they fools they are without resorting to their their tactics

2,yes those with adhd have a greater tendency to abuse drugs and alcohol according to statistics  it has nothing to do with the fact that they already take prescribed drugs  they want to escape their issues like so many kids today  why they end up abusing drugs is because they do not get high like kids without adhd do  the drugs have a reverse affect on them  so they end up taking higher and higher doses trying to achieve that high that their chemically unbalanced brain just does not get  that is why they often add alcohol into the mix and end up addicted to alcohol and drugs  educated parents can make all the difference in preventing their child from getting into the drug and alcohol cyclenni get so angry at those like the first responder who assume that addadhd doenst exist and that all kids with it are drug abusers  if you have a child with addadhd you know it really exists  i hope those who scoff are someday blessed with an adhd child  to those who are so undereducated please do your researchyou may learn somethingnnalso brain scans have shown a completely different thermal makeup in an addadhd brain compared to that of a child without addadhd
