3,constitution principles of governmentn n nfundamental principles of government in a nation either implied in its laws institutions and customs or embodied in one fundamental document or in several in the first category—customary and unwritten constitutions—is the british constitution which is contained implicitly in the whole body of common and statutory law of the realm and in the practices and traditions of the government because it can be modified by an ordinary act of parliament the british constitution is often termed flexible this enables britain to react quickly to any constitutional emergency but it affords no fundamental protections of civil or personal liberty or any areas in which parliamentary legislation is expressly forbidden the theory of the social contract developed in the seventeenth cent by thomas hobbes and john locke was fundamental to the development of the modern constitution the constitution of the united states written in one thousand seven hundred and eightyseven and ratified in one thousand seven hundred and eightynine was the first important written constitution and a model for a vast number of subsequent constitutional documents though to a large extent based on the principles and practices of the british constitution the constitution of the united states has superior sanction to the ordinary laws of the land interpreted through a process of judicial review that passes judgment on the constitutionality of subsequent legislation and that is subject to a specially prescribed process of amendment the rigidity of its written format has been counterbalanced by growth and usage in particular statutory elaboration see congress of the united states and judicial construction see supreme court united states and marshall john have kept the written document abreast of the times but a written constitution without a commitment to its principles and civil justice has often proved to be a temporary or rapidly reversed gesture in the eighteenth nineteenth and twentyth cent many countries having made sharp political and economic departures from the past had little legal custom to rely upon and therefore set forth their organic laws in written constitutions—some of which are judicially enforced adolf hitler never formally abolished the constitution of the weimar republic and the protections of personal liberties contained in the soviet constitution of one thousand nine hundred and thirtysix proved to be empty promises since the one thousand nine hundred and sixtys many of the newly independent countries of asia and africa have adopted written constitutions often on the model of the american british or french constitutions   onensee e mcwhinney constitutionmaking one thousand nine hundred and eightyone v bhagwan and v bhushan world constitutions twod ed one thousand nine hundred and eightyseven p bobbitt constitutional interpretation one thousand nine hundred and ninetyone j w peltason understanding the constitution twelveth ed one thousand nine hundred and ninetyone

3,short answer he made people have an appreciation for naturennthe importance of selfreliancenfour years before thoreau embarked on his walden project his great teacher and role model ralph waldo emerson wrote an enormously influential essay entitled “selfreliance” it can be seen as a statement of the philosophical ideals that thoreau’s experiment is meant to put into practice certainly selfreliance is economic and social in walden pond it is the principle that in matters of financial and interpersonal relations independence is more valuable than neediness thus thoreau dwells on the contentment of his solitude on his finding entertainment in the laugh of the loon and the march of the ants rather than in balls marketplaces or salons he does not disdain human companionship in fact he values it highly when it comes on his own terms as when his philosopher or poet friends come to call he simply refuses to need human society similarly in economic affairs he is almost obsessed with the idea that he can support himself through his own labor producing more than he consumes and working to produce a profit thoreau does not simply report on the results of his accounting but gives us a detailed list of expenditures and income how much money he spent on salt from one thousand eight hundred and fortyfive to one thousand eight hundred and fortyseven may seem trivial but for him it is not rather it is proof that when everything is added up he is a giver rather than a taker in the economic game of life n sitesn

2,mnnwe all know what anger is and we have all felt it whether as a fleeting annoyance or as fullfledged rage nnanger is a completely normal usually healthy human emotion but when it gets out of control and turns destructive it can lead to problems—problems at work in your personal relationships and in the overall quality of your life and it can make you feel as though you are at the mercy of an unpredictable and powerful emotion this brochure is meant to help you understand and control anger nnwhat is anger nnthe nature of anger nnanger is an emotional state that varies in intensity from mild irritation to intense fury and rage according to charles spielberger phd a psychologist who specializes in the study of anger like other emotions it is accompanied by physiological and biological changes when you get angry your heart rate and blood pressure go up as do the levels of your energy hormones adrenaline and noradrenaline nnanger can be caused by both external and internal events you could be angry at a specific person such as a coworker or supervisor or event a traffic jam a canceled flight or your anger could be caused by worrying or brooding about your personal problems memories of traumatic or enraging events can also trigger angry feelings nnexpressing anger nnthe instinctive natural way to express anger is to respond aggressively anger is a natural adaptive response to threats it inspires powerful often aggressive feelings and behaviors which allow us to fight and to defend ourselves when we are attacked a certain amount of anger therefore is necessary to our survival nnon the other hand we cannot physically lash out at every person or object that irritates or annoys us laws social norms and common sense place limits on how far our anger can take us nnpeople use a variety of both conscious and unconscious processes to deal with their angry feelings the three main approaches are expressing suppressing and calming expressing your angry feelings in an assertive—not aggressive—manner is the healthiest way to express anger to do this you have to learn how to make clear what your needs are and how to get them met without hurting others being assertive does not mean being pushy or demanding it means being respectful of yourself and others nnanger can be suppressed and then converted or redirected this happens when you hold in your anger stop thinking about it and focus on something positive the aim is to inhibit or suppress your anger and convert it into more constructive behavior the danger in this type of response is that if it is not allowed outward expression your anger can turn inward—on yourself anger turned inward may cause hypertension high blood pressure or depression nnunexpressed anger can create other problems it can lead to pathological expressions of anger such as passiveaggressive behavior getting back at people indirectly without telling them why rather than confronting them headon or a personality that seems perpetually cynical and hostile people who are constantly putting others down criticizing everything and making cynical comments have not learned how to constructively express their anger not surprisingly they are not likely to have many successful relationships nnfinally you can calm down inside this means not just controlling your outward behavior but also controlling your internal responses taking steps to lower your heart rate calm yourself down and let the feelings subside nnas dr spielberger notes when none of these three techniques work that is when someone—or something—is going to get hurt nnanger management nnthe goal of anger management is to reduce both your emotional feelings and the physiological arousal that anger causes you cannot get rid of or avoid the things or the people that enrage you nor can you

8,after reading your question and additional details i wondered whether your wife is a person who may at some time in her life have heard negative comments that caused her to develop insecure feelings about relationships with men  for example what if she heard her mother say in a moment of despair that men want women only for sex  and that if you give men sex they will be nice to you but if you do not then they will not have an ounce of interest in you  i think that as a result she may later in life in her search for a good husband have tested those words  you may have had sex before marriage but you also may very well be the only person she ever met who at times showed her love and affection without sex being involved this probably happened without planning on your part  you just loved her so much that you found that being with her was great even if you did not have sex on some of those occasions as a result your actions may have in her mind disproved the negatives she heard and that may have caused her to look on you as someone with the qualities of an ideal husband  after a couple of years of marriage it is possible that your relationship has become one where not by plan but by habit you show her the most loving and affectionate attention right around the time when you usually have sexsuch as at bedtime  hey this can happen very easily  but such an innocent turn of events could be what triggered your wifes old insecurities and caused her to want to retest those negatives she heard many years ago  if so this should pass soon as you continue to show your love for her

1,sweetness is not an objective thing to measure  if you mean sugar content then there are imperical ways of determining how much sugar is contained in a given portion of apple  nnbut things other than sugar taste sweet to humans  the element lead pb can take on a sweet taste  the romans used lead acetate to sweeten their food before they found out it was toxic  also that is why little children have been found eating paint chips because paint used to contain lead and it was sweet to them  nnphenylalenine an essential amino acid has a sweetness many times that of sugar  it is what gives nutrasweet it is sweetness  saccharin also has a sweetness three hundred times that of sucrosennif you are committed to the sweetness hypothesis the best instrument to use is the human tongue  do a blind taste test with a panel of subjects and have them rank various apples in order of sweetness  then take those apples and expose them to oxygen and observe which ones brown the fastestnni would recommend focusing on acidity instead of sweetness however  what makes apples turn brown when exposed to oxygen is an enzyme found in the cells called polyphenol oxidase or tyrosinase  normally this enzyme is confined within the cell wall and has limited access to oxygen  when an apple is cut the enzyme is bombarded with oxygen and it rapidly oxidizes chemicals within the cell that contain iron nnacidity comes into play because the protein enzyme has a narrow ph threshold  the acid denatures the enzyme thus inhibiting it is ability to oxidize iron  i believe that is why you will find out the tart tasting granny smith apples will turn brown the least  the tart taste comes from malic acid which is found in higher amounts in granny smiths

8,ok so the thing about mormons is that they will put up with a lot just to get someone to convert they are overly friendly and since most boys who are on a mission are still virgins and well still male they cannot help but have attractions even to those that they are trying to help maybe he did like you but my guess would be that he was disapointed that you did not convert but mormons arewell determined and it takes a lot for them to give up and as judgmental as they are sometimes they do not give up on nonmembers either they really believe in their mission and that they are doing the right thing and that there is hope for everyone i am sure he did get a little frustrated after you had attended and he was not getting through to you but my guess would be that he still does not want to give up on you i am sure he was attracted to you and really hoped that he could covert you that is the whole purpose of their missions maybe he was disapointed because he knew that he could not get to know you any deeper than he already does because you are not lds and i am not sure what to tell you as far as getting over him because i am not great at getting over crushes who are beyond my reach either i am glad however that you were unwilling to give up your faith just to make him happy actually mormons dislike it when people go to church just for them which happens often my friend who is a faithful mormon has that happen a lot guys go to church with her a few times just so they can sit next to her and spend time with her they feel even more disapointed about that then almost anything else except maybe converting someone to their church nnlastly i want to say i have noticed how many gorgeous mormon boys there are and i know what it is like to crush on an lds hottie you are not alone in that just stay true to yourself and love god and your son and the guy that he has set for you will come along and he will believe the same way you do and love your son

1,what everybody probably intends to say is that because fluorine has a high electronegativity there is a strong inductive effect  this induction pulls electron density through the molecular orbitals towards fluorine and in essence ends up weakening the oh bond at the business end of the acid  this weakening of the carboxylic acid bond results in a more acidic hydrogen  this inductive effect also assists in stabilization of the resulting carboxylate anion which is delocalized throughout the carbonylnbtw trifluoroacetic acid is much more acidic

1,well think about your question what is on the other side of every other border you know  another room another zone another country another place of some kind  borders are edges but they are edges that divide things  although it is kind of cool to think what if there is a border to space then you have also got to think so what is on the other side of the border  and does that place go on forever or maybe it has a border too  and what is on the other side of that border  so space in some form is going to go on and on and on n we can see almost fifteen billion light years with some of our most powerful telescopes and in all that huge distance there is absolutely nothing that looks like a border  it all looks infinite some scientists say maybe space is curved  but the curvature they are talking about is a curve with no border  wierd eh  that is why i like science  there are some very strange ideas turn out to be true

1,oops there is a problem with the question you used the words smaller and larger these may usually be the appearance of planets and moons but in fact these are the wrong words when you ask about objects in orbitnnthe variables that determine orbital paths are mass relative vectors and speeds nnsize smaller or larger is not one of the variables it may be true that a larger object  of the same material  has more mass than a smaller one but not always a large steel bucket has less mass than a cannon ball that can fit inside itnna dwarf star could be very small smaller than the earth a planet the like the earth would orbit the star even if the star was smaller nnplanets and moons are in orbit around each other an orbit is a kind of ellipse an ellipse is a kind of like a circle but it has two centers rather than one the objects travel around one of the centers if the two objects are exactly the same mass and speed and in orbit the two centers could be exactly between them and the orbits would be circular their size would not matter nnhowever in the real universe most objects are made of plasma iron silicates and other materials that because them to form stars planets asteroids planetoids comets and gas and dust clouds in most cases the larger ones  the most massive ones  are orbited by smaller ones  the less massive ones but is some cases the larger ones are very tenuous and although larger they still orbit the more massive object nnd the huge oort cloud is about six light years in diameter it is in orbit around our little sun

4,wifi nwifi also wifi wifi wifi or wifi is a brand originally licensed by the wifi alliance to describe the underlying technology of wireless local area networks wlan based on the ieee eight hundred and twoeleven specifications wifi is now so pervasive and the term so generic that the brand is no longer protected and it appears in websters dictionarynnwifi was intended to be used for mobile computing devices such as laptops in lans but is now often used for increasingly more applications including internet access gaming and basic connectivity of consumer electronics such as televisions and dvd players there are even more standards in development that will allow wifi to be used by cars in highways in support of an intelligent transportation system to increase safety gather statistics and enable mobile commerce ieee eight hundred and twoelevenpnna person with a wifi device such as a computer telephone or personal digital assistant pda can connect to the internet when in proximity of an access point the region covered by one or several access points is called a hotspot hotspots can range from a single room to many square miles of overlapping hotspots wifi can also be used to create a wireless mesh network both architectures are used in wireless community network municipal wireless networks like cyberspot in st cloud florida and metroscale networks like waztempe in tempe aznnwifi also allows connectivity in peertopeer mode which enables devices to connect directly with each other this connectivity mode is useful in consumer electronics and gaming applicationsnnwhen the technology was first commercialized there were many problems because consumers could not be sure that products from different vendors would work together the wifi alliance began as a community to solve this issue so as to address the needs of the end user and allow the technology to mature the alliance created another brand wifi certified to denote products are interoperable with other products displaying the wifi certified brandnnwifi how it worksnnthe typical wifi setup contains one or more access points aps and one or more clients an ap broadcasts its ssid service set identifier network name via packets that are called beacons which are broadcasted every one hundred ms the beacons are transmitted at one mbits and are relatively short and therefore are not of influence on performance since one mbits is the lowest rate of wifi it assures that the client who receives the beacon can communicate at at least one mbits based on the settings eg the ssid the client may decide whether to connect to an ap also the firmware running on the client wifi card is of influence say two aps of the same ssid are in range of the client the firmware may decide based on signal strength to which of the two aps it will connect the wifi standard leaves connection criteria and roaming totally open to the client this is a strength of wifi but also means that one wireless adapter may perform substantially better than the other in windows xp there is a feature called zero configuration which makes the computer show any network available and let us the end user connect to it onthefly in the future wireless cards will be more and more controlled by the operating system microsofts newest feature called softmac will take over from onboard firmware since wifi transmits in the air it has the same properties as nonswitched ethernet network even collisions can therefore appear like in nonswitched ethernet lans

1,dogs like thier ancestors wolves use licking for many purposesa subservient wolf for example always fawns upon more dominant members of the pack by crawling on the ground licking the muzzle of the dominant wolf to show that they recognize thier leadership however pups also lick the corners of the mouths of older wolves in order to induce regurgitation of food as well also members of a wolf pack lick eachother for grooming purposes which also reinforces the family bond of the pack dog are wolves and are genetically identical to them but dogs having been domesticated for fifteenzero years or so have diverged from wolves in many ways one of the most noticeable changes is that dogs never really reach maturity like a wolf does they stay more puppy like because we as thier domesticators have chosen the dogs that are more submissive to be our pets and over the years that selection has caused what is called neoteny in dogs basically what that isis they are more puppy like for thier entire livesso your dog as a domesticated wolf is like a puppy his whole life compared to wolves in the wild who mature at around threefour years of age so your dog licking your face is a sign of love in the sense that it is being done to reinforce pack bonds or to show submissiveness or possibly even as an attempt to make you regurgitate food for himher without really knowng why heshe is doing it in any case it is a sign of affection used to gain trust or food or reinforce the bond between you and himher
2,treatment for kidney failure varies depending on whether the problem is acute chronic or endstagennacute kidney failurenalthough not every person with acute kidney failure can regain normal kidney function in many cases acute kidney failure is reversiblennin all cases the first goal is to treat the illness or injury that originally damaged your kidneys once that is under control the focus will be on preventing the accumulation of excess fluids and wastes in your blood while your kidneys heal this is best accomplished by limiting your fluid intake and following a highcarbohydrate lowprotein lowpotassium dietnnyour doctor may prescribe calcium glucose or sodium polystyrene sulfonate kayexalate to prevent the accumulation of high levels of potassium in your blood you may also need to undergo dialysis to help remove toxins and excess fluids from your body while your kidneys are healingnnchronic kidney failurenchronic kidney failure has no cure but treatment can help control symptoms reduce complications and slow the progress of the diseasennthe first priority is controlling the condition responsible for your kidney failure and its complications if you have diabetes or high blood pressure hypertension for instance that means carefully following your doctors recommendations for diet and exercise and taking any medications as directednnin addition following a proper diet is extremely important in treating kidney failure itself restricting the amount of protein you eat may help slow the progress of the disease it can also help ease such symptoms as nausea vomiting and lack of appetite you will likely need to limit the amount of salt in your diet to help control high blood pressure over time you may also need to restrict the amount of potassium and phosphorous you consumennif you have high blood pressure your doctor will prescribe medications that both lower your blood pressure and help preserve kidney function these include the blood pressurelowering medications known as angiotensinconverting enzyme ace inhibitors and angiotensin ii aii receptor blockersnnyour doctor may also prescribe medications to help deal with complicationsnnendstage renal diseasenby the time endstage renal disease develops the conservative measures used to treat chronic kidney failure — diet medications and controlling the underlying because and complications — are no longer enough the kidneys are not able to support life on their own and dialysis or a kidney transplant becomes the only optionnnthe exact point at which this is needed varies from person to person in most cases doctors try to manage chronic kidney failure as long as possible because both dialysis and transplantation are serious undertakings that can be life threatening eventually however a time may come when their benefits outweigh their risksnndialysis is an artificial means of removing waste products and extra fluid from your blood when your kidneys are not able to do this on their own it is not a miracle cure and it presents significant risks including infection still it can help prolong life for people with endstage renal diseasennthere are several different types of kidney dialysis they includennhemodialysis the most common form of dialysis is known as hemodialysis it removes extra fluids chemicals and wastes from your bloodstream by filtering your blood through an artificial kidney dialyzer blood is pumped out of your body to the artificial kidney through a vascular access that is created surgically usually in your arm or leg inside the artificial kidney your blood moves across membranes that filter out wastes less than one cup of blood is outside your body at any one time most people require approximately twelve hours of dialysis each week usually divided into three sessions nperitoneal dialysis instead of filtering your blood through a machine this type of d
