yes defragger is come from norton
if you have norton utility do not bother


     do not bother if you have cpbackup or fastback  they all offer options

hi

in canada any gun that enters a national park must be sealed i think it is a
small metal tag that is placed over the trigger  the net result of this is
that you cant use a gun to protect yourself from bears or psychos in the
national parks  instead one has to be sensitive to the dangers and annoyances
of hiking in bear country and take the appropriate precautions

i think this policy makes the users of the national parks feel a little closer
to nature that they are a part of nature and as such have to deal with
nature on it is own terms

 but what came out in much lower profile reporting was that the
 victim was a prostitute and the man had not paid her  hence the
 false accusation

 there was no evidence the woman in question was a prostitute the
 defense merely alledged that she was

the fact that she was wearing a miniskirt with no underwear was
presented as evidence that she was a prostitute and the court
apparently found this compelling

 even clayton knows the difference  err perhaps clayton does not know
 the difference

clayton does indeed know the difference  greg apparently does not

 the judge found that there was some credible evidence that the marines
 were engaged in selfdefense

 no the judge found that the prosecution did not carry out the burder
 on proof

because the judge found that there was some credible evidence that the
marines were engaged in selfdefense  got it knucklehead

 a small clipping from clarinews under fair use guidelines 

    new hanover district court judge jacqueline morrisgoodson ruled in
    the benchtrial that the state failed to carry its burden in proving
    the marines acted to cause injury

because in part repeat after me the judge found that there was
some credible evidence that the marines were engaged in selfdefense
hopefully one of these days you will understand

 interesting that in two of the three cases clayton does what he accuses
 others of doing

with respect to credibility i would rate clayton cramer an order of
magnitude higher than a the news media and b homosexuals

subject re the arrogance of christians
organization nottingham university

in article  you wrote

 the genius of science is that it discovered that enormous progress 
 in knowledge could be made by isolating the study of physical 
 interactions for the more general areas of study and proceeding
 not by logical argument but by experiment the scientific method
 is hypothesize attempt to disprove the hypothesis if you fail 
 publish if others fail to disprove your hypothesis accept it
 as a working theory and move on this method is suitable only
 for the study of objects without will objects which do not
 take an interest in the experiment

science does not progress via experimentation but by philosophising  one
aim of experiments is to investigate the validity of the hyptheses
resulting from the models produced by this thinking process

 the arrogance of science is the assumption many advocates of 
 science make that the scientific method is the only method of
 serious study the only one leading to knowledge rather than
 belief 

science has one advantage of all other approaches to explaining the world
it is objective

 its further arrogance is the assumption which arises
 that since science is the only valid method of thought everything
 which exists must be the sort of thing which the scientific 
 method can study and that if the scientific method cannot 
 study it it either does not exist or cannot in any way be known

anything which affects the physical world can be studied  for example
since we are part of the physical world anything including spirits which
affects our behaviour can be observed  science does not make any claims
about the existence or nonexistence of objects which do not affect the
physical world

 since these asumptions about the nature of the world cannot
 themselves be made the subject of experiment it is bad science
 to believe them as well as arrogance illogic and just plain
 sloppy thinking

the purpose of science is to produce a model of the physical world  the
model must be able to explain all past observations and predict the outcome
of future observations  one of the aims of experiments is to carry out
well defined observations which are objective

ideally scientist will except the model which best describes the world and
the model which realises on the minimal number of assumptions  at the
moment models which do not rely on the assumption of some spiritual world
existing are equally powerful to ones which assume the assumption of a
spiritual world  as the nonspiritual models has fewer assumptions it
should be the currently accepted models

the scientific process never assumes that its present models are the
correct ones whereas many religions claim to represent the truth  the
arrogance of many theists is that they claim to represent the truth this
cannot be said of scientists

wales conference adams division semifinal
boston vs buffalo
the bruins are playing some excellent hockey and with cam neely back
and moog his old self again this should be a cakewalk  bruins in five

i am hoping for a fuhr miracle but i agree that boston will likely win the
series  goaltending is about equal top offensive players are about equal
mogilnylafontaine vs oatesjuneau but buffalo has no answer to neely
not to imply that neely is not a top offensive player by the way in fact he is one
of my favourites even though he is a damn bruin    and the rest of the
matchup wrt lineup favours boston anyway  but i think it will go six

quebec vs montreal
this one is very tough to call montreal certainly has the experience
factor but quebec is more talented imho it will come down to the
goalies  i will go with experience and roy canadiens in seven

agreed herebut montreal will be pushed to the limit  is it just me or
does everything montreal does in the playoffs come down to roy  go habs

final
boston vs montreal
will bruin domination continue in this rivalry yes moog has
consistently outperformed roy in the playoffs after one thousand nine hundred and eightysixother stuff
 bruins in five

i cannot predict a montreal victory because i have been watching them play for
six weeks and i am going to they severly need some tougher players especially to play
in the garden  last time they beat the bs fivetwo but boston had a clear
territorial advantage the victory was roys  at the same time i cannot
bring myself to predict the possibility of a loss so i will just say i will
not be putting money on this series 

patrick division semifinal

pittsburgh vs ny islanders
what can i say the pens are flying high and have the most talent in
the league 

agreed  ny does not have the goaltending to stop the onslaught independent
of the trouble they have given pittsburgh this year  pens in five which is
credit to ny

washington vs new jersey
capitals in five

agreed here too but i think it will go at least six  jersey has a decent
team and washington has done poorly against the division this year

pittsburgh vs washington
if the caps had bill ranford i might see an upset but don beaupre
just does not inspire my hopes  penguins in six

i think they will use tabaracci more after beaupre gets shelled  i do not
think it will go six eithermaybe five

conference final
pittsburgh vs boston
a replay of last year the penguins are just as good as twelve months ago
and the bruins are much improved but penguins in six

if pittsburgh plays boston i am going to they win in likely five possibly six  they
own the bruins  if they play montreal i think it will go to seven and once
again i will not be putting money on the seventh game  i say seven because the
habs have played pittsburgh very tough this season

campbell conference norris division semifinal

chicago vs st louis or minnesota
 blackhawks in five

chicago will win but i think in at least six  chicago is not that good
i am going to  and remember that they take ridiculous numbers of penalties

detroit vs toronto
the leafs have had an excellent season but they have been playing
playoff hockey all year  the habs under burns were the same way and
always wilted in the playoffs  red wings in five

very true  the leafs have much to be proud of but they will soon find out
why montreal did so lousy in the playoffs  toronto might win two or three 
at mlg though  wings in six maybe even seven

final
chicago vs detroit
 this will be a war fedorov will win it in ot red wings in seven

it will be a warpossibly the most intense playoff series of them all 
and yes i think detroit will win  probert will have to come up big though

smythe division semifinals

vancouver vs winnipeg
 canucks in seven

our first disagreement  canucks are playing like shit  they do not use their
size at all which may explain why they get hammered eightone by a team
chasing them calgarywinnipeg in six

calgary vs los angeles
this would have been tough to call except for three things one the
kings do not have a goalie two gary roberts will be back three the kings
shot themselves in the foot by trading a proven winner paul coffey
for a proven loser jimmy carson gretzky is just too weary to carry
this group flames in five

this is also tough for me to call because i have not seen the smythe enough 
i do not think roberts will be well enough to figure in coffey is a
nonissue who cares what carson has done before and never underestimate
gretzky  la in six

final
vancouver vs calgary
 flames in six

if it is these two calgary will not need six games  but i think it will be
lawinnipeg anyway and la in seven because of home ice

coference final
detroit vs calgary
 red wings in seven

wow must have been tough to go against your team  but let us see i picked
ladetroit  detroit will win probably in six

stanley cup final
pittsburgh vs detroit
three in a row and official dynasty status for the pens or can the
wings complete a dream season well the wings are better in goal not
sufficiently so though imho and have better dmen however mario and
the boys can sure score look for jagr to shine in the playoffs
though i sure would love to see probert beat some sense into him the
pens are just too much especially since detroit will have a tougher
battle to get here penguins in five

if pittsburgh plays detroit it will go longer than five and i would not bet
against the wings  they are very strong i am going to and nobody knows how strong
because they have been underachieving most of the year  if forced to choose
though i would have to take the penguins

a side note  vlad last week you said that selanne was a better player than
gilmour  no way  he is a more talented pure goal scorerbut aside from
the age difference there is no way i would take him over gilmour on my team
i am not asking for flames either by the wayi have spent more than enough time
arguing on behalf of selanne and i still say he is a great player  but while
he and gilmour are both dangerous offensively give teemu an edge
gilmour does it all  i know a lot of gilmourbashing goes on esp
from flame fans  but i am going to you guys are letting your dislike of gilmour cloud
your judgement when it comes to his skill  he is easily one of the best
allround players in the nhl

      do not buy one that is the best way to avoid tickets
      i used to have one and whenever a cop would pull me over see
      the thing give me a ticket  one time my sister was driving
      and had it in the glove compartment it was broken and she
      got a ticket  in one thousand nine hundred and eightyseven i had received four tickets because of
      it one for my sister so a total of five

      that was five years ago now i do not have one and have not

      drastically  only two days ago i was going seventyseven mph on highway
      with fiftyfive mph limit cop saw me i break a little nothing
      happened i was driving a minivan with my family in it
      otherwise i have cutlass supreme  which i do seventy most of the
      times on the highway

      so basically my opnion is not to get one if you do get pulled
      over the cop will hear your excuse but if you have a radar
      detecter he will not again this has been my experienc


just get a remote model that is not visible to the cop  but be sure to get
front and rear sensors

you can also just put the detector off to the side on the dash so the cop
does not see it right awayvalentine is the best detector by far as stated
by car and driver and even tells you what direction the radar is coming from
 it also gives the amount of threats it is picking up so if you go through
 the same place everyday and it always goes off there you can glance at the
 number of threats the valentine is detecting to see if it is a genuine cop
  it is about three hundred and you can only get it factory directone problem

umm when i was doing sound reinforcement for a living i used to get direct boxes which convert
unbalanced onefour jacks to balanced xlrs for about twentyfive each or a little more for higher
quality you will need two for a stereo signal of course and a little adapter thingy from 
radio sht to convert from rca to onefour total cost should be around fifty you can also buy
transformers for quite a bit less and wire them yourself total cost there should be under thirty
you can get all this stuff from any pro music shop that sells sound reinforcement gear
the benefit no noise that you can hear will be generated in the cables going to the component
with the balanced inputs even when you run them in bad places like next to power lines

i have not been following the previous hrs  but there are two that i saw
live that would have to be up there up where there  
one rick mondays hr to bury the expos in the nl championship in one thousand nine hundred and eightyone
it was hit off steve rogers who is a rhp and primarily a starter
why was he used as a reliever when the spos had reardon and billlee
warming up in the bullpen  considering monday could not touch lhp
lee would have been a safe bet  he was not even doing any drugs at that
time or so he told me and around fifty others on a recent venture into 
montreal  the blast was not the important aspect  it was the timing
seventh game a tie game and in the top of the nineth  the expos almost
came back though
two mike schmidt hit one that killed the expos in one thousand nine hundred and eighty  so close yet so
far
and
three strawberry killed a pitch on the second day of the season a couple of
years ago  it went off the technical ring in the big o  it almost left
the stadium  that was hit hard

my guess of how part of a session might look

question do you approve of clintons performance

conclusion clinton has a low approval rating because he is not moving

reaching the speed of light lightship altares the fourman crew 
eventually journeyed into a black hole and ended up on the far side of the

satisfied in those days

wow  i was beginning to think that i had made that up  i remember that
movie it was about onefive hours long  i do not think they ended up anywhere
in the known universe  

i remember they got a message halfway out to proxima centauri that earth
transmitted a day after they launched timed to catch up with them at the
halfway point  i thought it was neat i think i was all of ten at the time

does anyone know if into infinity has been released on video i have some
spaceone thousand nine hundred and ninetynine shows on vhs and know that thunderbirds etc also are available in
england
 
spaceone thousand nine hundred and ninetynine has just come out with four episodes released in american stores

me
what seems to be happening here is the situation getting totally blown out of
proportion  in my post i was referring to your regular patrolman in a car
cruising around the city vs gang members  of course the police have access
to the things that you mentioned but do they use tanks and such all of the
time  of course they do not and that is the point i was trying to make  every
day when i go out to lunch i always see cops coming in  the majority that i
see are still carrying revolvers  not that there is anything wrong with a
revolver but if you are a cop that is up against some gang member with a
couple
of automatics in his coat i mean semiauto handguns you are going to be at a
disadvantage even with training

david

      this is the arms race fallacy  that somehow bigger guns make an
individual safer  the problem is that for each corresponding level of
offensive power the is not an automatic level of defense increase  the
problem is that there is a sort of lethality threshold that once you get
past you are only talking about a metter of degree

      regardless of what cops are up against there is really no reason
for the average beat cop to have anything bigger than a pistol on him
as a personal weapon and maybe a rifle and a shotgun in the cruiser

      i mean think about it  carrying a monster pistol or submachinegun
does not make the cop any less wounded if somebody shoots him  a lot
of police departenments have switched to semiautomatics as better
more reliable weapons and more stopping power but there is a point
of diminishing returns

this is a very very good point  who cares what kind of gun you have got if
you are lying on the ground dead

      and as far as automatics go any gang member carrying around a
couple of automatics an incredible rarity is going to be far more of
a menace to himself and innocent bystanders than anything he might be
tryinh to aim at  one auto is hard enough to control  anybody who
could control two is going to get the police officer regardless of
what the police officer is armed with

more stuff deleted  mostly mine
        my question is this  what would a police officer gain from
having a submachinegun or similar personal weapon that he already
does not have with a ninemm or tenmm semiautomatic pistol  i do not see
as how the police should be hosing around fullauto fire nor has
my experience with police officers or the stats regarding how many
police officers get killed by other cops made me feel such would be a
good idea  precise fire is far more preferable  nor should they using
bigger guns  most standard sidearms have more then sufficient
stopping power when properly applied  all more powerful weapons would
do is make the likelihood of death higher without really giving police
significantly more options

another very good point that is well taken  it seems that when lots of lead
is flying either the cops or the gangs someone innocent always gets caught
in the crossfire

paone hundred and fortysix thousand and eightutkvmoneutkedu  i still remember the way you laughed the day
your pushed me down the elevator shaft  i am beginning to think you do not
love me anymore  weird al

all points made above are well taken  i guess i am in the mindset of
having more makes it better which is obviously not the correct mindset
to take in this discussion  now that i think about the situation a
little more carefully i see your point exactly david and i
wholeheartedly sp agree  like i said i am just assuming that more
bullets andor bigger bullets is better  once again though i want to
state that i am a progun individual and do not believe that gun control
is really a viable option here in the united states regardless of the drivel

hi there

does anyone know why apple has an ambiguous message for
csix hundred and fifty regarding fpu  in all mac price lists i have seen every csix hundred and fifty
has the message fpu optional  i know from what we have discussed in this
newsgroup that all csix hundred and fifty have the fpu built in except the foureighty
configuration  why would they be so unclear about this issue in their
price list
i am planning to buy the csix hundred and fifty eighttwo hundred and thirtycd pretty soon but i am now getting
confused with whether it comes with fpu or not
why say optional if it is built in
please anybody help me understand this game

regards

thian

if you get the centris six hundred and fifty with cd configuration you are getting a mac with
a sixtyeightrcforty processor that has builtin math coprocessor support  my 
understanding is that the optional fpu refers to your option of purchasing
the centris six hundred and fifty foureighty without fpu or one of the other configurations with fpu

apple does not offer an upgrade from the nonfpu system to become an fpu
system  and it is unclear whether the forty processor on the nonfpu system
a sixtyeightlcforty can be replaced with a sixtyeightrcforty supplied by another vendor
apple did send a memo out at one point sating that the centris six hundred and ten which only
comes with a nonfpu sixtyeightlcforty processor cannot be upgraded to support an fpu 
the pin configurations of the two chips apparently do not match so you cannot
swap one for another again according to apples memo

hope that helps

of course the list has to agree with the nickname laws laid down by the
gipu almost two thousand years ago you know the nine of them that were written on
the iron tablets that melted once and had to be reinscribed  since i am
a prophet of the gipu i decree that you should post the whole list of
nicknames for the frequent posters here

if the first rule of humor is never having to say you are sorry then the 
second rule must be never having to explain yourself  few things are 
worse that a joke explained  in spite of this and because of requests
for me to post my list of nicknames i must admit that no such list
exists  it was simply a plot device along with me being the keeper
of the list to make the obvious play on the last name of fuller and to
advance the idea that such a list should be made

i assumed that the old timers would recognize it for what it is  
nevertheless how about a list of nicknames for altatheism posters
if you think of a good one just post it and see if others like it
we could start with those posters who annoy us the most like bobby or

 how about people who are not religous  take the inner city  there are
 many people that care little for religion  lot of crime  lot of
 murder  this is the other end lack of religion that allows wrong to
 happen

i lived in tokyo for a year and a half and one of the many reasons why
i intend to go back indefinitely is the freedom one enjoys when one can
walk anywhere and i mean anywhere at any time of day or night and not
feel uneasy even if ones from an ethnic minority as i was

clues for bobby why do i bother i tokyo is a city and inner tokyo
is an inner city ii there is a negligible level of violent crime and
a street murder will be a lead item on national tv news iii the
population is almost universally atheistic

next time i go for a stroll around beirut at night i will let you know how
it compares

hi

while running the ms quick c compiler in a dos window under windows threeone 
this evening i got a program has violated system integrity close all 
applications exit windows and restart your computer error

i started to do this when i immediately got a serious disk error message
from windows  hit return to retry  i did that about five times and then
rebooted to find that quite a few files have been corrupted somehow
i am including the chkdsk output below

questions

one  is there an easy way to restore everything to working order
what might be some better approaches

two  what might have caused this  does the smartdrv cache make me more
vulnerable  i am suspicious of hard drive caches especially when they
cache data writing

the straightforward approach would be to run chkdsk with the f option to 
fix the disk and then it looks like i would probably have to reinstall windows
and a few other things

thanks for your comments and suggestions

more now then ever if they blast away a few good fokes then that is

with the arms build up in waco they needed to hit that compound with

i hope this is a joke if not here is my response

the batf has a history of noknock raids with poor evidence often resulting in
innocent people being killed or suffering injury to person or property  i will
not support the batf until they clean up their act maybe  as to equipment
the batf has damn near anything it wants  their faults were in intelligence
military and civilian definitions apply tactics attacking during daylight methodology the fbi stated that it is against government policy to assault
a position where there are noncombatantspotential hostages without attempting
negotiations first and legality  the batfs jurisdiction is taxes on firearms
and tobacco  they are a branch of the department of the treasury  they have
very curiously backed away from their claims of illegal weaponry to push the
childabuse charges the batf has no jurisdiction over nonfirearmstobacco
issues and the charges of childabuse had been investigated in the past with
no violence and no validation  this was a clear case of first the batf then
the fbi having watched too many rambo movies  my opinion is that the agent
in charge should be charged with executing an illegal raid criminal negligence
murder civil rights violations and breaking hisher oath to uphold and defend
the constitution of the us  the warrant should be unsealed to reveal to the 
public what justification the batf thought it had in committing an armed assault
on american citizens  and while on the issue of investigating this issue
the randy weaver case and the johnny lawmaster case should be investigated for
batf wrongdoing

what gives isreal the right to keep jeruseleum  it is the home of

	israel has a right to keep jerusalem for many reasons  they
include the fact that the majority of the citizens are israeli the
fact that israel maintains religious freedom for all people and the
historical connection of judaism to jerusalem

	when jerusalem was devided by a jordanian invasion in one thousand nine hundred and fortyeight
the cease fire agreement included the right of individuals to visit
religious shrines  this cease fire agreement was violated by jordan
who did not allow jews to visit holy sites under their control  the
jordanians also bulldozed every synagoge in the city  they turned a
jewish cemetary into a hotel and used the gravestones in their
latrines

	israel has allowed individuals of all religions into
jerusalem protected holy sites and demonstrated its fitness to
control the city

	also i should point out that islam is not centered in
jerusalem but has holy sites there  the home of islam is mecca
where all muslims should make a pilgramage the hajj  unlike israeli

andysailstanfordedu andy freeman says

clue  kratz position is not a defense against inaccuracy

i oppose gun control because it does not work  if it did i would support
it  in fact i supported gun control before i did my homework

there is no demand for progun people who do not know what they are
talking about  in fact they would be much better off if they did not say
anything

and why is this freeman  even if a progun person does not know what they are
talking about there is always the possibility that they will learn a thing or
two  i am and will continue to post even if people get angry with what i have
to say  i have several good sources of material now that i know where to look
so calm down

there is lots of information flowing on tpg for those interested in
learning  one can participate in those discussions without ranting
inaccurately  failure to do so has consequences

ah freeman seems to forget from my statement that i am learning  i have also
asked several of the notsohostile folks on this group for sources of
information to read  do you think freeman that maybe this means i am
interested in learning  i think it does because as you said people who do not
know anything will not be good for the progun because

another good habit to get into is to go readonly for a while to take
the time to figure out how things work

another good habit to get into is to realize that not everyone is you freeman
and accept mistakes  sure maybe it could have been some type of
misinformation being slung by some antigun nut but it was not  i made my
statement to inform everyone of this and everyone who replied said do not worry
about it but also to learn as much as you can  they accepted my mistake and
gave me sources of information and told me to read as much as possible  i have
read several posts of yours and have found them informative  why do not you
give me the same chance

another if the other party can decrypt it does not that mean that someone
else could also i assume that if everyone has a different key the only use

if the penguins get out of the patrick they will win the

i am sure that washington will most definitly throw a rench into the
penguin plans  i am a canucks fan not that i think much of their
chances this year but it seems to me like washington is the only
team that can stop the penguins from winning their next stanley cup

a friend of mine was a regular volunteer blood donor  during surgery he
was given five units of blood and after a suitable recovery time he went
to donate blood at a bloodmobile he was hiv and did not know it

the red cross notified him with a registered letter  that is all  no
counselling no nothing  he died two years ago this week  he left behind

how long ago was this  when i said you would get counselling i meant if
you did it now  long ago practices varied and agencies had to gear
up to provide the counselling

a wife and a fouryearold son  many people have suggested that his wife
should sue the red cross but she would not  she says that without the
blood transfusions he would have died during the surgery


good for her  what we do not need is everyone suing community service
agencies that provide blood that people need  testing is not fool proof
the fact that he got aids from a transfusion if he really did does
not mean the red cross screwed up  prior to one thousand nine hundred and eightythree or so there was not
a good test and a lot of bad blood got through  this was not the fault
of the red cross  when did he get the transfusions

what is new in my opinion friday sixteen april one thousand nine hundred and ninetythree  washington dc

one space billboards is this one the spinoffs we were promised
in one thousand nine hundred and fifty science fiction writer robert heinlein published the
man who sold the moon which involved a dispute over the sale of
rights to the moon for use as billboard nasa has taken the firsteps toward this
 hideous vision of the future  observers were
startled this spring when a nasa launch vehicle arrived at the
pad with schwarzenegger painted in huge block letters on the
side of the booster rockets  space marketing inc had arranged
for the ad to promote arnolds latest movie now space marketing
is working with university of colorado and livermore engineers on
a plan to place a milelong inflatable billboard in lowearth
orbit  nasa would provide contractual launch services however
since nasa bases its charge on seriously flawed cost estimates
wn twentysix mar ninetythree the taxpayers would bear most of the expense this
may look like environmental vandalism but mike lawson ceo of
space marketing told us yesterday that the real purpose of the
project is to help the environment the platform will carry ozone
monitors he explainedadvertising is just to help defray costs


what do you think of this revolting and hideous attempt to vandalize
the night sky it is not even april one anymore
what about light pollution in observations i read somewhere else that
it might even be visible during the day leave alone at night
is nasa really supporting this junk

here is another way of looking at it

when we die we are released from the arc of time and able
to comprehend our lives in toto  to visit each moment in
time sequentially or all at once but not able to alter the
actions thoughts or feelings we hadhavewill have in this 
life

from that perspective i posit that all will have direct knowledge
of god and be able to recognize at each moment of time wether
we were doing what we ought  that the experience of having
lived a life far from god will be an eternal torment  that 
having lived a life of grace will be an eternal joy  that the 
resurrection of the body comes not from any physical reconstitution
of our present forms but knowledge of our present forms by our
fully cognizant souls

as an aside  if we were to be restricted for all time to

on the seventyeightth commemorative anniversary of the turkish genocide of the armenians
we remember those whose only crime was to be armenian in the shadow of an 
emerging turkish protofascist state in their names we demand justice

in april one thousand nine hundred and fifteen the turkish government began a systematically executed 
depopulation of the eastern anatolian homeland of the armenians through a 
genocidal extermination this genocide was to insure that turks exclusively
ruled over the geographic area today called the republic of turkey the 
result onefive million murdered thirty billion dollars of armenian property stolen
and plundered this genocide ended nearly threezero years of armenian civilization
on those lands today the turkish government continues to scrape clean any
vestige of a prior armenian existence on those lands todays turkish
governmental policy is to rewrite the history of the era to manufacture
distortion and generate excuses for their genocide of the armenian people in 
the face of refutation ad nauseam the turkish historical society and cronies 
shamelessly continue to deny that any such genocide occurred this policy 
merely demonstrates that in the modern era genocide is an effective state 
policy when it remains unredressed and unpunished a crime unpunished is a 
crime encouraged adolf hitler took this cue less than twentyfive years after the 
successful genocide of the armenians

hi there

i have made a vga mode thirteenh graphics library available via ftp  i originally
wrote the routines as a kind of exercise for myself but perhaps someone
here will find them useful  they are certainly useable as they are but
are missing some higherlevel functionality  they are intended more as an
intro to mode thirteenh programming a starting point

 the library assumes a three hundred and eightysix processor but it is trivial to modify it
 for a two hundred and eightysix  if enough people ask i will make the mods and repost it as a
 different version

the routines are written in assembly tasm and are callable from c  they
are fairly simple but i have found them to be very fast for my purposes
anyway  routines are included to enter and exit mode thirteenh define a
virtual screen put and get pixels put a pixmap rectangular image with
no transparent spots put a sprite image with seethru areas copy
areas of the virtual screen into video memory etc  i have also included a
simple c routine to draw a line as well as a c routine to load a two hundred and fiftysix
color gif image into a buffer  i also wrote a quickndirtytm demo program
that bounces a bunch of sprites around behind three windows

the whole package is available on spangcamosunbecauseca in pubdosvglzip 
it is zipped with pkzip twofourg

it is completely in the public domain as far as i am concerned  do with
it whatever you like  however it would be nice to get credit where it is due

during the nuclear fission reaction the uranium fuel can get hot enough
to melt when this happens the liquid uranium is pumped to the cooling
tower where it is sprayed into the air 

	nonsense  first the uranium fuel is sealed in zirconium
alloy cylinders which do not melt in any circumstances short of 
major failure of the power plant  second the primary water
that circulates inside the reactor core is never pumped into the
cooling tower it is the secondary water cycle that goes 
through the cooling tower  third liquid uranium would burst
into flame on contact with air

contact with the cool outside air
will condense the mist and it will fall back to the cooling tower floor
there it is collected by a cleaning crew using shop vacs and is then
reformed into pellets for reactor use the next day

	cleaning crew working in a mist of uranium  this is a
toxic heavy metal even if it were not radioactive  should not there
be some smileys here  or frowneys

message is common in many food we eat including chinese though some oriental
restaurants might put a tad too much in them  i have noticed that when i
go out and eat in most of the chinese food restaurants i will usually get
a slight headache and an ununsual thirst afterwards  this happens to many
of my friends and relatives too  and heh we eat chinese food all the
time at home  but we do not use message when we are cooking for ourselves

so when we put one and one together it can be safely assumed that
message may cause some allergic reactions in some people

stick with natural things  message does not do body any good and possibly
harms for that matter  so why bother with it  taste food as it should
be tasted and do not cloud the flavor with an imaginary cloak of message

as i understood it message is natural  is not it found in 
tomatoes

anyway lots of people are terribly allergic to lots of natural
things peanuts onions tomatoes milk etc  just because something
is natural does not mean it will not because problems with some folks

as for how foods taste  if i am not allergic to message and i like
the taste of it why should not i use it  saying i should not use
it is like saying i should not eat spicy food because my neighbor
has an ulcer

people have long modified the taste of food by additives whether
they be chiles black pepper salt cream sauces etc  all of these
things cloud the flavor of the food  why do we bother with them
how should food be tasted  is not it better left to the diner

i have found jewish people very imagentative and creative jewish religion was the foundation for christianity and
islam  in other words judaism has fathered both religions now islam has turned against its father i may say
it is ironic that after communizem threat is almost gone religion wars are going to be on the raise 
i thought the idea of believing on one god was to unite all man kind how come both jews and islam which believe
on the same god the god of ebrahim are killing each other is this like dr frankenstiens story
how are you going to stop this from happening how are you going to deal with so many muslims nuking them 
would distroy the whole world would god get mad since you have killed his followers you believe on the same
god same heaven and the same hell after all what is the peacefull way of ending this saga


man kind needs religion since it sets up the rules and the regulations which keeps the society in a healthy state
a religion is mostly a sets of rules which people have experienced and know it works for the society
the praying keeps the sole healthy and meditates it god does not care for man kinds pray but man kind hopes
that god will help him when he prays
religion works mostly on the moral issues and trys to put away the materialistic things in the life but the 
religious leaders need to make a living through religion so they  may corrupt it or turn it to their own way to
make their living ie muslims have to pay  twenty percent of their income to the mullahs i guess the rabie  gets his
cut too 

is in it that religion should be such that everybody on planet earth respects each other be good toward each other
helps one another respect the mother nature is in that heaven and hell are created on earth through the acts 
that we take today  is in it that within every man there is good and bad he could choose either one then he will
see the outcome of his choice  how can we prevent man kind from going crazy over religion how can we stop
another religious killing field under poor gods name what are your thoughts do you think man kind would
to come its senses before it is too late


ps on the side

do you think that moses saw the god on mount sina why would god go to top of the mountain he created
the earth he could have been anywhere why on top the mountain was it because people thought to see god
you have to reach to the skiesheavens why god kept coming back to middle east was it because they created
god through their imagination  is that why jewish people were told by god they were the chosen ones

profit mohammad was married to khadijeh she was a jewish she taught him how to trade she probably taught
him about judaism quran is mostly copy right of taurah sp old testement do you think god wrote quran
makeh was a trade city before islam do you think it was made to be the center of islamic world because mohammad
wanted to expand his trade business is that why  god has put his house in there 

i think this religious stuff has gone too far all man kind are going to hurt from it if they do not wise up
look at david koresh how that turned out i am afraid in the bigger scale the jews and the muslims will
have the same ending

religion is needed in the sense to keep people in harmony and keep them doing good things rather than
plotting each others distruction  there is one earth one life and one god let us all man kind be good toward
each other

god help us all

   the original question was about who started the fire and whether the 
    madmen were inside or outside the compound  to which i replied on 
    the possible sanity level of those inside and outside

was that your argument  well you did not make it very well  you started 
from the questionable premise that the fire was necessarily an act of
insanity rather than an act of negligence or an accident  recall one
survivor claims that the fire started when a tank knocked over a kerosene 
lamp  kind of makes arguments regarding relative sanity somewhat moot no

and another survivor claims he heard someone shouting the fires started
odd terminology  that is what one says when you know a fire is planned not 
when one occurs by accident  we will have to wait and see what the evidence 
shows assuming one is willing to believe any evidence offered by the 
distrustful ones

  according to an australian documentary made in the year before the stand off 
  began koresh and his followers all believed he was christ  koresh 
  had sex with children and women married to other men in the compound  
  these were the perfect children resulting from the great seed of 
  his magnified horn  exmembers describe him in ways not dissimilar 
  to the way jim jones has been described
 
 point noted  have you submitted your faith and sex life for batf clearance
 better hurry i believe the deadline was april fifteen
 
 i paid my taxes  there was no reference to sex or religion on the form
 the comments above and below were meant to address who might be unstable 
 enough to keep children in a building with tear gas or start a fire

nice evasive maneuver mr chekov but they are still on our tail

let me ask it more plainly  which of the above complaints about david 
koreshs religious or sexual proclivities justified an armed raid by the 
bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms

neither  again i was merely addressing the sanity level of the players  
i agree that the batf handled the affair badly from day one  by the way i heard 
on the news today that the affadavit behind the noknock warrant was unsealed 
today  grenade launcher was the only thing on the list that i found 
unusual

  two of the nine who escaped the compound said the fire was deliberately set 
  by cult members

  so when they talk to the news reporters directly and relate the same details 
  will you believe them

 believe them  i will not even recognize them  and neither will anyone else
 who does not know them personally

 do you believe they would put impostors before the national tv cameras

it is not entirely farfetched  nobody outside the compound would know 
everybody inside the compound  do not forget the batf admits having 
agents inside the compound in any case

ambitious news reporters could use the documentary filmed by an australian 
in one thousand nine hundred and ninetytwo on the compound grounds to help identify survivors  i for one 
will check their stories for consistency with what i learned in a long 
news story about that documentary

 at this point we are getting conflicting reports from the survivors
 best wait til more light is she would upon them  of course this is no 
 good if you believe in eternal darkness

i am simply being the devils advocate  there is reasonable doubt by the
boatload standing in the way of anybody totally swallowing the official 
government story on waco

certainly there is some room for doubt  i certainly reserve the right 
to change my opinions when new evidence warrants such a change  if i 
were conspiratorially minded however i would never be able to change 
my mind because any evidence i disliked would have to be a lie 
fabricated by the distrustful ones

the package for only fifteen  also consider offering an inexpensive

very similar in the approach  send in your money and you get 
documentation and a free upgrade to the latest version  perhaps even 
support of some small degree  whatever you want to offer that is better 
than the circulating version

you are lucky if only twenty of the instances of your program in use

it does not really hurt legit users  shareware is still much cheaper than

 swatikas were also common in american indian markingspainted walls etc  is
 it the swastika that is bad  
 
 just want to back this up with a personal anecdote  my grandparents
 have a navajo rug made in the one thousand nine hundred and twentys which they received in trade 
 from the weaver while living in flagstaff arizona  the decorative motif
 consists of four large black swastikas one in each corner  what is more the
 color scheme is black white and red  to the casual glance it would
 undoubtedly appear to be a nazi relic of some kind  yet they owned it
 ten years before hitler and the national socialists came to power  
 
 as i recall they took it down in the thirtys and did not feel quite right
 about putting it back up until the sixtys  it still draws comments from 
 those who do not know what it is

having lived played and worked on and near the navajo reservation
for a number of years i can confirm this is an ancient pattern
found in petroglyphs dated eight hundred to one thousand two hundred years old

also the indians never stopped making rugs with this pattern  they
just stopped selling them after the nazis preempted the swastika

note also that the indian versions use both clockwise and
counterclockwise swastikas

ob guns  it is the rare navaho family that does not own a rifle 
they remember being relocated by the us army and do not intend to
do it again  the hopi on the other hand have a dislike for
weapons from my experience  perhaps they just hide them better
from strangers

i would like to digitize the output of a squid magnetometer range ten v
to ten v and do digital signal processing in a computer say a macintosh
ii or a four hundred and eightysix pc  i would like a good sixteen bit adc with good linearity and a
high conversion speed at least fifty khz preferably two hundred khz  other concerns

two  must i use an adc external to my computer to avoid digital noise
     feedback into my sensitive squid electronics

might be a good idea  the resolution you requested is about zerothreemv
in order to get what you have paid for noise level better be lower than
that  it is kind of hard to do it in a noisy box like you can expect
inside a pc

before you pay  for a pc card test it out by sampling a low
distortion sine wave i think there is a sine wave on a cd  digital
domain   there are possibly other low thd sources  run the digitized
waveform through a fft transform and take alook at the noise floor on
the spectrum  that is should give you a good indication of the design
that is what i am doing to test a data acquistion system i have designed
 i got the idea from maxim data sheet

if you can live with fourteen bit resolution i would recommend looking at
the maxone hundred and twentyone from maxim  it is a high speed three hundred and eightkhz complete
sampling ad with dsp interface  the input range is  fivev and it
uses a serial interface which can easily be optically isolated
from the computer to elinimate a major noise source  the analog design
guide i got from them shows a one hundreddb noise level  they claim a seventysevendb
max eightyfive typ thd  looks pretty good for the twelve  one thousand pieces

a evaluation kit is available  might want to give these nice folks a
call  oneeight hundrednine hundred and ninetyeighteight thousand eight hundred or fax four hundred and eightseven hundred and thirtysevenseven thousand one hundred and ninetyfour and four hundred and eight seven hundred and thirtysevenseven thousand six hundred extfour thousand
for application assistance

this assumes that you can build your own das and write your own software
hey you can get the maxone hundred and twentyone as a free sample just by calling the oneeight hundred 

i would appreciate discussion of your personal experience with a mac or pc
based adc system

i would recommend you to find out the resolution that can be gotten out
of your system by looking at the noise level otherwise you might be
throwing out your money

we here at utah state university cooperative extension have been using
wfourwg for a while now  we wanted to talk to the internet with the mail
package so we got the smtp gateway  you also need a tcpip transport
package on top of that which is utterly stupid but that is what they
require to get the smtp gateway to work  you need a dedicated pc
for the gateway and if you are looking at remote access you need another
dedicated pc for the remote mail stuff  we do not have the remote mail
going but you indicate that that is what you want to do  

there is a glitch somewhere in the system though  i do not know if it
is ms mail the gateway or the vax here on campus that is choking in the
mail that is sent  the scenario is this  the outgoing mail goes to a
unix system which then routes the mail where it needs to go  if that mail
is routed to the vax the vax has problems some times receiving the mail
most messages do get through this way except if someone has there mail
on the vax forwarded to some other location  that is the main gotcha
where ever the mail is forwarded to that person gets a message header
then a message saying boudary error garbage code stuff  if you
can stay away from sending to a vax you are ok  the system people
of course say that the vax is not the problem the gateway is probably
the problem  if anyone wants to get help it is only one hundred and seventyfivezero for one
support call until problem is worked out  phooey to that i say  i
am looking vigorously for a better idea  

if you go forward on any of this and find out anything knew  please

add to this the outrageous cost of putting someone to death special cell
block years of court costs extra guards and the benefits of the death
penalty entirely disappear
 
 that is because of your earlier claim that the one innocent death
 overrides the benefit of all the others  obviously it is tragic  but
 it is no argument for doing away with the death penalty  if we went
 to war and worried about accidentally killing civilians all of the time
 because our determination of who the enemy really is is imperfect then
 there is no way to win the war
 
 yes  fortunately we have rightthinking folks like your good self in power
 and it was therefore deemed acceptable to slaughter tens or even hundreds of
 thousands of iraqis in order to liberate oilhhhkuwait  we won the war
 hurrah hurrah

the number of civilian iraqi deaths were way overexaggerated and 
exploited for antiwar emotionalism by the liberal news media  the
facts are that less iraqis died in the gulf war than did civilians 
in any other war of comparable size this century  this was due mostly
to the short duration coupled with precise surgical bombing techniques
which were technically possible only recently

the idea that hundreds of thousands of iraqi citizens died is
ludicrous  not even hundreds of thousands of iraqi soldiers died
and they were the ones being targeted  or do you think that the us
and its allies were specifically out to kill and maim iraqi civilians
either the smart bombs did not hit their targets and we know they did
or they were targeting civilian targets  which is hardly condusive to
destroying iraqs military potential  the military mission planners are
not fools they know they have to hit military targets to win a war
hitting civilian targets does nothing but unite the people against you
not a laudable goal if one wants the people to rise up against their
tyrantdictator 
 
 ok so some innocent people died  yes maybe the unarmed civilians fleeing
 along that road did not need to be bombed to bits  perhaps that kid with half
 his face burned off and the little girl with the mangled legs were not
 entirely guilty  but it is worth the death of a few innocents to save the
 oilhhhlives of the kuwaiti people is not it  after all the iraqis may
 not have had a chance to vote for saddam but they showed their acceptance of
 his regime by not assassinating him right  all that surrendering and
 fleeing along open roads was just a devious ploy  we were entirely within
 our rights to bomb them just in case without finding out if they were
 soldiers

how about all the innocent people who died in blanketbombing in wwtwo
i do not hear you bemoaning them  war is never an exact science but
with smart bombs it is becoming more exact with a smaller percentage
of civilian casualties  sometimes mistakes are made targets are
misidentified innocents die  that is war the way it really is
but the alternative to allow tyrannical dictators to treat the earth
like it is one big rummage sale grabbing everything they can get is
worse  like patrick henry said some two hundred and seventeen years ago i know not what
course others may take  but as for me give me liberty or give me
death  war is always the price one must be willing to pay if one
wishes to stay free   

 
 the death penalty was conceived as a deterrent to crime  but the legal
 shenanigans that have been added automatic appeals lengthy court
 battles etc have relegated that purpose to a very small part of what
 it should be  hence the question is  do we instate the death penalty as
 it was meant to be and see if that deters crime or do we get rid of
 it entirely
 
 yes let us reinstate the death penalty the way it ought to be  all that shit
 about fair trials and a court of appeals just gets in the way of justice 
 let us give the police the absolute right to gun down the guilty and save
 ourselves the expense of all those lawyers
 
 think of the knockon benefits too  la would never have had to spend so
 much money cleaning up after riots and holding showcase trials if the cops
 had been allowed to do their job properly  a quick bullet through the head
 of rodney king and another for the cameraman and everyone would have been
 saved a great deal of unnecessary paperwork and expense
 
 after all if the police decide a mans guilty that ought to be enough  the
 fact that the death penalty has been shown not to have any deterrent effect
 over imprisonment well that is entirely irrelevant
 
 
 mathew
  

mathew your sarcasm is noted but you are completely offbase here
you come off sounding like a complete peacenik idiot although i
feel sure that was not your intent

so the iraqi war was wrong eh  i am sure that appeasement would have
worked better than war just like it did in wwtwo eh  i guess we
should not have fought wwtwo either  just think of all those innocent
german civilians killed in dresden and hamburg  how about all the poor 
french who died in the crossfire because we invaded the continent  we 
should have just let hitler take over europe and you would be speaking
german instead of english right now

tyrants like hussein have to be stopped  his kind do not understand
diplomacy they only understand the point of a gun  my only regret is
that bush wimped out and did not have the military roll into baghdad so
now hussein is still in power and the iraqi peoples sacrifice not to
mention the three hundred and fiftyseven americans who died was for naught  liberating kuwait 
was a good thing but wiping hussein off the map would have been better

and as for poor poor rodney king  did you ever stop and think why
the jury in the first trial brought back a verdict of not guilty
those who have been foaming at the mouth for the blood of those
policemen certainly have looked no further than the video tape
but the jury looked at all the evidence evidence which you and i
have not seen  when one makes a judgment without the benefit of a
trial where evidence can be presented on both sides one has simply
lowered himself to the level of vigilante justice a stateofmind
which your sarcasm above seemingly spoke against but instead tends
to support in the case against the policemen  

law in this country is intended to protect the rights of the accused
whether they be criminals or cops  one is not found guilty if there is
a reasonable doubt of ones guilt and only the jury is in a position
to assess the evidence and render a verdict  anyone else is simply
succumbing to verbal vigilantism

i experienced a sudden numbness in my left arm this morning  just after
i completed my fourth set of deep squats  today was my weight training
day and i was just beginning my routine  all of a sudden at the end of
the fourth set my arm felt like it had gone to sleep  it was cold turned pale
and lost sixty of its strength  the weight i used for squats was not that
heavy i was working hard but not at one hundred effort  i waited for a few 
minutes trying to shake the arm back to life and then continued with
chest exercises flyes with lighter dumbells than i normally use  but
i dropped the left dumbell during the first set and experienced continued
arm weakness into the second  so i quit training and decided not to do my
usual hour on the ski machine either  i will take it easy for the rest of
the day

my arm is still somewhat numb and significantly weaker than normal 
my hand still tingles a bit down to the thumb color has returned to normal
and it is no longer cold 

horrid thoughts of chunks of plaque blocking a major artery course through
my brain  i am thirtyfour vegetarian and pretty fit from my daily exercise
regimen  so that cannot be it  could a pinched nerve from the bar
because these symptoms i hope

it likely has nothing to do with chunks of plaque but it sounds like
you may have a neurovascular compromise to your arm and you need medical
attention before doing any more weight lifting

   actually i must also ask the faqs one most popular reason why graphics
   do not show up do you wait for an expose event before drawing your
   rectangle

suppose you have an idle app with a realized and mapped window that contains
xlib graphics  a button widget when pressed will cause a new item
to be drawn in the window  this action clearly should not call xcopyarea 
or equiv directly instead it should register the existence of the new
item in a memory structure and let the expose event handler take care
of rendering the image because at that time it is guaranteed that the
window is mapped

the problem of course is that no expose event is generated if the window
is visible and mapped  do you know the best way to tickle a window so
that the expose event handler will be invoked to draw this new item


what does this have to do with my original question  i previously
stated that i did an xcopyarea of the deptheight pixmap to the screen
just to make sure that my image had data and it did  this is not
a problem with expose events it has to do with xcopyplane not
working

does anyone have a code fragment they could send demonstrating that
xcopyplane works  this would be very helpful

 what are you talking about  the rabin government has clearly
 indicated its interest in a territorial compromise that would leave
 the vast majority of the arabs in judea samaria and gaza outside
 israeli control

just an interrupting comment here since early one thousand nine hundred and eightys  israelis said they are 
willing to give up the adminstration rule of the occupied terretories to
palestineans palestineans refused and will refuse such settlement that denies
them their right of selfdetermination period

 i know i was just pointing out that not compromising may be a bad idea and
 there are in israel voices against negotiations and i think there are many
 among palestineans also against any negociations 
 
 just an opinion

 dorin

ok i donot know why there are israeli voices against negotiations however
i would guess that is because they refuse giving back a land for those who
have the right for it

as for the arabian and palestinean voices that are against the
current negotiations and the socalled peace process they
are not against peace per se but rather for their wellfounded predictions
that israel would not give an inch of the west bank and most probably the same
for golan heights back to the arabs an eighteen months of negotiations in madrid
and washington proved these predictions now many will jump on me saying why
are you blaming israelis for noresult negotiations
i would say why would the arabs stall the negotiations what do they have to
loose 

arabs feel that the current negotiations is only for legitimizing the current
statusquo and for opening the doors of the arab markets for israeli trade and
oranges that is simply unacceptable and would be revoked

subject re there is a good deal more confusion here   you started off with the 
assertion that there was some objective morality and as you admit
here you finished up with a recursive definition   murder is 
objectively immoral but eactly what is murder and what is not itself
requires an appeal to morality

yes

now you have switch targets a little but only a little   now you are
asking what is the goal   what do you mean by goal   are you
suggesting that there is some objective goal out there somewhere
and we form our morals to achieve it

well for example the goal of natural morality is the survival and
propogation of the species  another example of a moral system is
presented within the declaration of independence which states that we
should be guaranteed life liberty and the pursuit of happiness  you see
to have a moral system we must define the purpose of the system  that is
we shall be moral unto what end

murder is certainly a violation of the golden rule  and i thought i had
defined murder as an intentional killing of a nonmurderer against his will
and you responded to this by asking whether or not the execution of an
innocent person under our system of capital punishment was a murder or not
i fail to see what this has to do with anything  i never claimed that our
system of morality was an objective one
i thought that was your very first claim   that there was
some kind of objective morality and that an example of that was
that murder is wrong   if you do not want to claim that any more
that is fine

well murder violates the golen rule which is certainly a pillar of most
every moral system  however i am not assuming that our current system
and the manner of its implementation are objectively moral  i think that
it is a very good approximation but we cannot be perfect

and by the way you do not seem to understand the difference between
arbitrary and objective   if keith schneider defines murder
to be this that and the other that is arbitrary   jon livesey may
still say well according to my personal system of morality all
killing of humans against their will is murder and wrong and what
the legal definition of murder may be in the usa kuweit saudi
arabia or the prc may be matters not a whit to me

well objective would assume a system based on clear and fundamental
concepts while arbitary implies no clear line of reasoning

hello  i am currently designing the architecture of a chip which is
intended to help speed up common operations on a windowing system such as
x  a friend and i are designing the chip as the final course project for
an advanced computer architecture course taught by dr fred brooks at
uncchapel hill  while we feel that we have got a pretty solid design
currently we would really like to get ahold of some frequency data from an
xwindows server so that we can make the most effective use of our bit
budget  

unfortunately i have been unable to find anything of this sort in the
various x faqs or x manuals that i have seen  does anyone have some type of
frequency data like how many copyrectangle operations vs drawlines and
things of that sort  or barring that a program that records requests to
the server into a logfile that i can munge on myself

any and all help would be very appreciated

many thanks

you will notice that i did not mention sweep wings even though the

dirctly from the germans  the difference is that swept wings do not
change their angle of sweep sweep wings do  perhaps the similarity

phil a lot of this was also done by the military

after nasa aerodynamicists proposed them and nasa test teams
demonstrated them  richard whitcomb and rt jones at langley
research center were giants in the field

dryden was involved in the flight testing of winglets and area
ruling in the seventys and fiftys respectively  it is true that we
used military aircraft as the testbeds kcone hundred and thirtyfive and yfone hundred and two but
that had more to do with availability and need than with military
involvement  the yfone hundred and two was completely ours and the kcone hundred and thirtyfive was
bailed to us  the air force of course was interested in our
results and supportive of our efforts

dryden flew the first digital fly by wire aircraft in the seventys no
mechnaical or analog backup to show you how confident we were
general dynamics decided to make the fsixteen flybywire when they saw how
successful we were  mind you the avro arrow and the xfifteen were both
flybywire aircraft much earlier but analog

phil egad i am disagreeing with mary shafer  

the nasa habit of acquiring secondhand military aircraft and using
them for testbeds can make things kind of confusing  on the other
hand all those secondhand navy planes give our test pilots a chance

talk about adding insult to injury  
 
i for one believe that the use of civil forfeiture should be abolished by
a decent administration not continued  instead it looks like that
illgotten gain will be used to help pay for wiretap equipment

i wholeheartedly agree  knowing that we have let our law enforcement agencies
seize our property against the fifth amendment of our constitution tells me that
we are absolving ourselves of our responsibility for selfgovernance  we have
to take our government back from the selfserving politicians who create laws
and rules only to better their positions within the government  we have allowed
them to take too much power from the people of this nation  that situation has
to be changed

allowing the law enforcement agencies to use the seized property to payoff drug
informants who lie and continue to deal in drugs is tantamount to making a pact
with the devil himself  it is a vicious cycle  the law enforcement agencies are
motivated to seize property to fund their own activities  and having no easy
way for the citizen to regain the property intact once taken gives even more
incentive for the agencies to take property

it is also interesting to note that two months ago rush limbaugh said that
clinton would have the plumbers out in force shortly  clinton and his
henchmen firmly believe in strong ubiquitous government control  anytime a
leader believes in that the leader will use every means possible to retain that
control and take more

we have to take our government back  otherwise we will end up living in the
equivalent of a hightech third world dictatorship  we have to take
responsibility for ourselves our personal welfare and our actions

i am posting to this group in hopes of finding someone out there in
network newsland who has heard of something similar to what i am going
to describe here  i have a fourteen year old daugter who experienced
a seizure on november three one thousand nine hundred and ninetytwo at sixfortyfiveam after eating kellogs frosted
flakes  she is perfectly healthy had never experienced anything like
this before and there is no history of seizures in either side of the
family  all the tests eeg mri ekg came out negative so the decision
was made to do nothing and just wait to see if it happened again

well we were going along fine and the other morning april five she had
a bowl of another kellogs frosted kind of cereal fruit loops i am
embarrassed to admit that i even bought that junk but every once
in a while so i pour it in her bowl and think oh oh this is the
same kind of junk she was eating when she had that seizure  ten 
minutes later she had a full blown seizures this was her first exposure
to a sugar coated cereal since the last seizure

when i mentioned what she ate the first time as a possible reason for
the seizure the neurologist basically negated that as an idea  now
after this second episode so similar in nature to the first even
he is scratching his head  once again her eeg looks normal which i
understand can happen even when a person has a seizure

once again we are waiting i have been thinking that it would be good
to get to as large a group as possible to see if anyone has any
experience with this kind of thing  i know that members of the medical
community are sometimes loathe to admit the importance that diet and
foods play in our general health and wellbeing  anyway as you can
guess i am worried sick about this and would appreciate any ideas
anyone out there has  sorry to be so wordy but i wanted to really get

 what is cryptology cryptography plaintext ciphertext encryption key

  the story begins when julius caesar sent messages to his trusted
  acquaintances he did not trust the messengers so he replaced every a
  by a c every b by a d and so on through the alphabet only someone
  who knew the shift by two rule could decipher his messages

  a cryptosystem or cipher system is a method of disguising messages so
  that only certain people can see through the disguise cryptography is
  the art of creating and using cryptosystems cryptanalysis is the art
  of breaking cryptosystemsseeing through the disguise even when
  you are not supposed to be able to cryptology is the study of both
  cryptography and cryptanalysis

  the original message is called a plaintext the disguised message is
  called a ciphertext encryption means any procedure to convert
  plaintext into ciphertext decryption means any procedure to convert
  ciphertext into plaintext

  a cryptosystem is usually a whole collection of algorithms the
  algorithms are labelled the labels are called keys for instance
  caesar probably used shift by n encryption for several different
  values of n it is natural to say that n is the key here

  the people who are supposed to be able to see through the disguise are
  called recipients other people are enemies opponents interlopers
  eavesdroppers or third parties

 what references can i start with to learn cryptology

  for an introduction to technical matter the survey articles given
  in part ten are the best place to begin as they are in general
  concise authored by competent people and well written however
  these articles are mostly concerned with cryptology as it has
  developed in the last fifty years or so and are more abstract and
  mathematical than historical the codebreakers by kahn kahsixtyseven is
  encyclopedic in its history and technical detail of cryptology up
  to the midsixtys

  introductory cryptanalysis can be learned from gaines gaifortyfour or
  sinkov sinsixtysix this is recommended especially for people who want
  to devise their own encryption algorithms since it is a common
  mistake to try to make a system before knowing how to break one

  the selection of an algorithm for the des drew the attention of
  many public researchers to problems in cryptology consequently
  several textbooks and books to serve as texts have appeared the
  book of denning deneightytwo gives a good introduction to a broad range
  of security including encryption algorithms database security
  access control and formal models of security similar comments
  apply to the books of price  davies prieightyfour and pfleeger pfleightynine

  the books of konheim koneightyone and meyer  matyas meyeightytwo are quite
  technical books both konheim and meyer were directly involved in
  the development of des and both books give a thorough analysis of
  des konheims book is quite mathematical with detailed analyses
  of many classical cryptosystems meyer and matyas concentrate on
  modern cryptographic methods especially pertaining to key management
  and the integration of security facilities into computer systems and
  networks

  the books of rueppel rueeightysix and koblitz kobeightynine concentrate on
  the application of number theory and algebra to cryptography

 how does one go about cryptanalysis

  classical cryptanalysis involves an interesting combination of
  analytical reasoning application of mathematical tools pattern
  finding patience determination and luck the best available
  textbooks on the subject are the military cryptanalytics series
  frieone it is clear that proficiency in cryptanalysis is for
  the most part gained through the attempted solution of given
  systems such experience is considered so valuable that some of the
  cryptanalyses performed during wwii by the allies are still
  classified

  modern publickey cryptanalysis may consist of factoring an integer
  or taking a discrete logarithm these are not the traditional fare
  of the cryptanalyst computational number theorists are some of the
  most successful cryptanalysts against public key systems

 what is a bruteforce search and what is its cryptographic relevance

  in a nutshell if fx  y and you know y and can compute f you can
  find x by trying every possible x that is bruteforce search

  example say a cryptanalyst has found a plaintext and a corresponding
  ciphertext but does not know the key he can simply try encrypting the
  plaintext using each possible key until the ciphertext matchesor
  decrypting the ciphertext to match the plaintext whichever is faster
  every welldesigned cryptosystem has such a large key space that this
  bruteforce search is impractical
    
  advances in technology sometimes change what is considered
  practical for example des which has been in use for over ten years
  now has twofiftysix or about tenseventeen possible keys a computation with
  this many operations was certainly unlikely for most users in the
  midseventys the situation is very different today given the dramatic
  decrease in cost per processor operation massively parallel
  machines threaten the security of des against brute force search
  some scenarios are described by garron and outerbridge garninetyone

  one phase of a more sophisticated cryptanalysis may involve a
  bruteforce search of some manageably small space of possibilities

 what are some properties satisfied by every strong cryptosystem

  the security of a strong system resides with the secrecy of the key
  rather than with an attempt to keep the algorithm itself secret

  a strong cryptosystem has a large keyspace as mentioned above  the
  unicity distance is a measure which gives the minimum amount of
  ciphertext that must be intercepted to uniquely identify the key and
  if for some key the unicity distance is much longer than the amount
  of ciphertext you intend to encrypt under that key the system is
  probably strong

  a strong cryptosystem will certainly produce ciphertext which appears
  random to all standard statistical tests see for example caeninety
    
  a strong cryptosystem will resist all known previous attacks a
  system which has never been subjected to scrutiny is suspect

  if a system passes all the tests mentioned above is it necessarily
  strong certainly not many weak cryptosystems looked good at first
  however sometimes it is possible to show that a cryptosystem is
  strong by mathematical proof if joe can break this system then
  he can also solve the wellknown difficult problem of factoring
  integers see part six  failing that it is a crap shoot

 if a cryptosystem is theoretically unbreakable then is it
  guaranteed analysisproof in practice

  cryptanalytic methods include what is known as practical
  cryptanalysis the enemy does not have to just stare at your
  ciphertext until he figures out the plaintext for instance he might
  assume cribsstretches of probable plaintext if the crib is
  correct then he might be able to deduce the key and then decipher the
  rest of the message or he might exploit isologsthe same
  plaintext enciphered in several cryptosystems or several keys thus
  he might obtain solutions even when cryptanalytic theory says he
  does not have a chance

  sometimes cryptosystems malfunction or are misused the onetime pad
  for example loses all security if it is used more than once even
  chosenplaintext attacks where the enemy somehow feeds plaintext into
  the encryptor until he can deduce the key have been employed see
  kahsixtyseven
  
 why are many people still using cryptosystems that are
  relatively easy to break

  some do not know any better often amateurs think they can design
  secure systems and are not aware of what an expert cryptanalyst
  could do and sometimes there is insufficient motivation for anybody
  to invest the work needed to crack a system

furthermore the big bucks approach to science promotes what i think is
one of the most significant errors in science  choosing to investigate
questions because they can be readily handled by the currently
fashionable methodology or because one can readily get institutional
or corporate sponsorship for them instead of directing attention to
those questions which seem to have fundamental significance

shades of james watson  that is exactly the way many workers have described
their misgivings about the human genome project  if you take a rigid 
definition of scientific research the mere accumulation of data is not 
doing science  one of the early arguments against the project were that the 
resources would be better used to focus on specific geneticsrelated 
problems rather than just going off and collecting maps and sequence  
the project cannot be so narrowly defined or easily described now though

subject re is key escrow enough
lines twentyfour

	  the points raised about checking what is actually in the chip as
	opposed to what is allegedly programmed therein raise yet another trust
	issue  even if we assume that these trusted agents are really entering
	a wide range of sone and stwo seeds rather than using the same one all the
	time to reduce the key search space to thirty bits i assume they are not
	doing so by picking up an iron filing and poking it into the circuitry
	at carefully selected points to encode data  they would presumably be
	punching numbers into a computer which for all they know could program
	the chips in a manner completely independent of the sone and stwo values they
	are feeding into the system

sone and stwo are clearly the backdoor  we should assume they are all
compromised  if they are not compromisable why the hell not use a
hardware true random number source  there is not a random number
source anywhere in this proposal  the whole thing is deterministic
from the day the serial number is stamped on the chip

nope it cannot be trusted  this is all about two levels of access 
the possibly honest key escrow that police forces have to use and
ostensibly the fbi and the back door that let us the nsa decode everything
on the fly  and maybe some backhanders to the fbi when they want a
warrantless tab in exchange for favours

  here is how i talk to nonchristians who are complaining about hell

me	do you believe you are going to heaven
him	i do not believe in heaven
me	so are you going there
him	if there was a heaven i would
me	but since there is not a heaven you are not going there are you
him	no

  the point is that heaven is based on faithif you do not believe in heaven
there is no way you are going to be in it

    hmmm people in the americas before the time of christ children who
die young etc 


  of course the next step is i do not believe in hell either so why will i
be there  it seems to me that hell is eternal death and seperation from god


   but of course the popular conception of hell correct or incorrect is
something akin to eternal perpetuation of consciousness at the very least


most atheists do believe that when they die they will die forever and never
see godso they do in fact believe that they are going to hell

   i think a good number of atheists believe there is nothing beyond 
bodily death but it is simply an abuse of language to say they believe
they are going to hell they believe they are going to die understand
that you have turned hell into a verb using the same logic it also follows
that all animals are going to hell are you sure this is what you want
to say presumably animals do not have the opportunity to get to heaven
but this still does not change the fact that they are going to hell die
a final death

   i do not claim to know whether or not there is an afterlife of some
sort but if hell is as you described final death and
not eternal perpetuation of consciousness it will be true that
there will never be a moment when i am aware of my nonexistence 
assuming i go to hell and not to heaven in other words i will
never know i am dead hmmm 


  hell does not have to be worse than earth to be hellbecause it is eternal

    ever hear people say of a loved one who was ill and has died
 at least she is not suffering any more she is in heaven now 

    consider the following statement
 at least she is not suffering any more she is in hell now

    the above statement sounds odd but according to your definition of hell 
it would be a true statement the person in hell would not be suffering 
granted they would not be anything would not be having any
conscious experience whatsoever 

    you say hell death is eternal however this loses its meaning 
to a dead person and to me it seems that the threat of some sort 
of eternal punishment only makes sensehas force if one expects to
be conscious throughout this eternity 

    many atheists believe that the thirst for an afterlife is simply the
product of propaganda friend do you want the free gift of eternal life
it is my understanding that the early jews did not believe in an afterlife
can anyone back me up on this combined with the survival instinct all
animals share the difference is we have consciousness and once we get the
idea of eternal life drilled into our brains we then desire a sort of
supersurvival 

 
and it is a lot worse than heaven  that is the only comparison that matters

    that would depend on what heaven is like if god is a king and 
an eternity in heaven consists of giving thanks and praise to the king
i might opt for hell i read a lovely account of a missionary trying to
convert eskimos to christianity in the book the illusion of immortality
by corliss lamont the missionary started to speak about heaven 
are there seals in heaven will we be able to go hunting asked an
eskimo the missionary said no the group of eskimos then said something
to the effect of well what good is your heaven if there is no hunting
scram i highly recommend the above book ioi to anyone who wants an
account of the other side of the immortality coin that there is no 
immortality

a lot of stuff deleted

      for that matter stay biblical and call it omar rasheet the feast of
 first fruits  torah commands that this be observed on the day following
 the sabbath of passover week  sunday by any other name in modern
 parlance  why is there so much objection to observing the resurrection
 on the onest day of the week on which it actually occured  why jump it all
 over the calendar the way easter does  why not just go with the sunday
 following passover the way the bible has it  why seek after unbiblical
 methods
  
in fact that is the reason easter jumps all over the calendar passsover
itself is a lunar holiday not a solar one and thus falls over a wide
possible span of times  the few times that easter does not fall during or
after passover are because easter is further linked to the vernal equinox
the beginning of spring

more deletions
  
       so what does this question have to do with easter the whore
 goddess  i am all for celebrating the resurrection  just keep that
 whore out of the discussion
  
your obsession with the term whore clouds your argument  whore is
a value judgement not a descriptive term

more deletions

overall this argument is an illustration of the etymological fallacy
see jp louw semantics of nt greek  that is the idea that the true
meaning of a word lies in its origins and linguistic form  in fact our
own experience demonstrates that the meaning of a word is bound up with
how it is used not where it came from  very few modern people would
make any connection whatsoever between easter and ishtar  if daniel
seagard does then for him it has that meaning  but that is a highly
idiosyncratic meaning and not one that needs much refutation

hello mr au

i have to disagree regarding your assessment of macintosh in hong kong the mac has a sizeable share of the typesetting market as in the yous a local magazine next magazine similar to newsweek here uses the mac extensively i have seen sir speedy and other franchises in hong kong equipped with macbased systems true the discount is not as steep as here because customers in hong kong cannot buy from gray market nor are mac being sold thru mass merchandisers like apple does here with the performa lin


e at this point the sale of mac is handled by one exclusive distributor on the other hand you can always get a pc clone or in the earlier days illegal clones of the apple iie

your perception of the mac not being too popular in hong kong is simply because most hobbyists and users find it much cheaper to go to one of those basement stores that sell pc clones with probably illegal copies of bios than to pay for a mac

similarly you cannot say lotus onetwothree surely is not well accepted in hong kong because the sale is so low may be it is because of all those places in kowloon where illegal copies of lotus onetwothree can be bought for twenty and ten for a professional looking but illegal copies of the manuals

hey ed you did not give me the chance  sheesh

the answer is absolutely as ed so eloquently describes

edone who knows what he is doing and why that will be faster  it may
edbe possible to improve your technique if you have no idea what it is
edthrough trial and error but it is not very effective methodology

herein lies the key to this thread

kindly note the difference in the responses  ed and i are talking
about knowing riding technique while mike is arguing knowing the physics
behind it  it is possible to be taught the technique of countersteering
ie push the bar on the inside of the turn to go that way without
having to learn all the fizziks about gyroscopes and ice cream cones
and such as seen in the parallel thread  that stuff is mainly of interest
to technomotorcycle geeks like the readers of recmotorcycles  
but does not need to be taught to the average student learning csteering
mike does not seem to be able to make the distinction  i know people
who can carve circles around me who could not tell you who newton was
on the other hand i know very intelligent welleducated people who
think that you steer a motorcycle by either one leaning two steering
a la bicycles or three a combination of one and two  knowledge of physics
does not get you squat  knowledge of technique does

subject re ford probe  opinions centered around the gt
organization the santa cruz operation
lines one hundred and twentyseven


jeremy g mereness  says

can anyone offer any opinions of the ford probe ala how they do in
the long run repair records reliability mileage etc

i am fixing to buy a car in the next few months aiming toward something
a little bigger than a typical small car and with a little more power i
am considering the mxsix probe accord corolla and the two hundred and fortysx 

the probe is the youngest of the bunch thus my interest in opinions
but every magazine and ratings book places it as an excellent value
by the way the two hundred and fortysx is rearwheel drive and is due for a redesign for one thousand nine hundred and ninetyfour 

thanks in advance

while i do not read normally read this group i was looking for valentine radar
information sigh maybe in the faq and came across your posting

i bought a ninetythree probe gt with the pep two hundred and sixtythreea last july now at nine thousand five hundred miles
after debating over the sentra sernxtwo thousand mxsix mrtwo stealth prelude 
and celica

check this months consumer reports for previous probe records  

my criteria a fun car with abs airbag over one hundred and thirtyhp and less than twentyfivek
i thought about a turbo but checking with insurance people ruled that out
the tristar cars eclipsetalonetc were out since they do not have an air bag
ditto for the mustangalso no abs
the sernxtwo thousandmtwenty fell into the pocketrocket category  a good used car buy
the mxsix was almost there but rolled more than i liked  
i did not like the prelude dashinstrumentation at all  too weird for me
the mrtwo has a much smaller nonpassenger space than i needed so out that went
the celica was ok but underpowered when loaded with options and somewhat
overpriced too in nonturbo form
i never considered the two hundred and fortysx since it did not have an airbag  i did look at it
for its rwd virtues but that is it  the corolla never entered my mind
i should have looked at the mitsubishi vrfourdodge stealth more
since my list was exhausted i bought the probe  

the car design is different than earlier years so it is too early to see its
reliability so far  for what it is worth my comments

my dislikes
shutting door with windows up from inside rarely makes good wind seal
headlights have stuck up a few times weather
air conditioning broke four thousand miles pressure cycling switch
condensation around rear washer fluid container does not drain completely
crammed engine little hope for doityourselfers typical
parts somewhat more expensive than normal ford parts
underside plastic does not like sharp driveways and speedbumps typical
assembly gripes tape on radiator screw fell out of dash seat seams not 
stitched properly  hopefully just a fluke
ford only gives one key with the car  cmon ford spend an extra few pennies
rear hatch has no padding on corners when up  i am waiting for the day when
i bash my head on the corner
horn buttons behind air bag in spokes and not in center personal preference
tires fling dirtmud onto side of car 

my likes
engine designvalvessoundssmoothnesspowermileagetorque  definitely one
handling very good for fwd understeer only at limits
transmission the five speed is a must
usable instrumentation lovely readable analog everywhere
very little torque steer at full power much better than the ninety sho i drive
stability at one hundredmph high gearing though
low cowl good visibility in front
heated outside mirrors nice in fog never tested in freezing weather
absair bag see above
rear seats fold down i have few rear seat passengers so a trunk not important
no shakerattle noises when going over bumpspotholes still
tires two hundred and twentyfivefiftyfivevrsixteen goodyear eagles seventy left hoping for thirtyk 

as you can see i am primarily interested in the engine  while it does not
have the uummmph of a bigliter car or the turbo rush the big selling
point for me was the allaluminum twentyfour value twofive liter engine  

the overall car is a good buy for the money  that market segment has not changed
much since july prelude vtec honda del sol  i drive it to and from work
each day on relatively smooth roads and most noticable thing is that the
probes suspension does not like potholes  when you test drive one find a 
potholed road somewhere around town and see if the jarring you get is tolerable
if you have three passengers by all means bring them along too  they will find
that they have no room in the back and you will find that the car rides
differently if that is better is up to you  also there is a lot of glass
around you which i was not expecting the temperature inside the car gets pretty
hot in the summer  my back seat passengers now very few complain about
the lack of ventilation you may want to consider that when combined with
the heat  i have heard that the exhaust system has trouble but mine works fine
leather and the keyless entry system were not available when i got the car so
i cannot comment on them i got the car before it was officially announced  
i prefer cloth to leather anyway  

i would not want this car in the snow  the suspension is too rough for the
inevitable surprise potholes tires are not meant for snow and the seats assume
that you are not wearing lots of thick clothing  rain is much better  water 
generally beads off the windshield at freeway speed the windshield wiper
controls are easy and understandable and i barely hydroplaned once with the
eagles and i was really trying  
there is also a definite lack of cup holdersmall storage places  the gt
has map holders below the speakers in the door but they are rigid plastic
that could fit two cassettes or cds max  the center consolestorage binarm
rest has one cup holder and the back of the front seats have a cloth pouch
but that is it  no change holders  quite a letdown from the sho
and the probe is definitely not a peoplemover car or an econobox car

lastly do not store wet car covers in the back  the foam will soak the 
water up and the result will not smell pleasant

subject sharks review part two defensemen twonineteen
organization computer science department stanford university
lines ninetytwo

i finally got it back with great thanks to mark spiegel for saving and sending
it



two	rob zettler		season	fourth
acquired	ninetyoneninetytwo from minnesota in dispersal draft
grade		cc

zettler gave the sharks every bit he is got this year unfortunately this still
was not enough to make him any more than a marginal nhler if that  he works
hard for sure but is no better than average on defense and is prone to
costly penalties and defensive lapses at times while being basically an
offensive zero zero goal and seven assists in seventynine games  he would be hardpressed
to make the team next year

three	david williams		season twond
acquired	ninetyoneninetytwo free agent from new jersey
grade		cc

i am going to williams was the most valuable defenseman for the sharks in ninetyoneninetytwo
playing a combination of good offense three goals and twentyfive assists in fiftysix games and
good defense  but he playing the first part of this season in kansas city
was good neither offensively nor defensively this year it then appears that
ninetyoneninetytwo was a fluke  although he improved towards the end of the season he
was prone to being out of position defensively and did not demonstrate the
playmaking skills that made him the teams leading scorer among defensemen last
year  he would also be hardpressed to make the team next year

four	jayson more		season twond
acquired	ninetyoneninetytwo from montreal in expansion draft
grade		b

after being touted as the teams top defensive prospects in training camp
before ninetyoneninetytwo more had a rather disappointing ninetyoneninetytwo as he was not
particularly good defensively and had just seventeen points in fortysix games  he then
proceeded to improve his game massively this season becoming the teams most
reliable defenseman whom the team can count on night in and night out to play
steady defense and providing occasional but only occasional offensive flash
offensively he was even more disappointing than last year eleven points in seventythree
games but his defense improved tremendously  he is probably best as the
defensive part of a defense combination with an offensive defenseman

five	neil wilkinson		season fourth
acquired	ninetyoneninetytwo from minnesota in dispersal draft
grade		b

wilkinson was probably the teams top defensive defenseman in ninetyoneninetytwo  however
partially because of injuries he was not the same this year as he missed twentyfive
games total due to nagging knee and back injuries and seemed to be slowed
even when playing  he then had often to be saved by his defensive partners
that is if they are there at all  but he also had some solid games and if
he can be complete healthy he can still be a force

six	sandis ozolinsh		season onest
acquired	ninetyoneninetytwo twond round pick in entry draft
grade		i a

at the time of his injury december thirty against the philadelphia flyers
ozolinsh was well on track to be i am going to the teams mvp  a serious knee injury
in that game though forced him to miss the rest of the season fortyseven games
but he still finished as the teams top scorer among defensemen twentythree points
which of course tells more about the lack of offense the sharks had from
their defensemen but it also tells of ozolinshs abilities  at the time he
was playing very good defense along with excellent offense he was still
susceptible to socalled rookie mistakes but was probably the defenseman who
made the least of them on the team rookie or veteran  if he can come back
from his injuries he is ready to be a star

nineteen	doug zmolek		season onest
acquired	ninetyoneninetytwo from minnesota in dispersal draft
grade		b

zmolek had basically a solid and durable year being one of the only two sharks
to play in all eightyfour games of the season  he was solid on defense but
after being billed as an offensive defenseman he did not show it fifteen points
he was also prone to penalties and his two hundred and twentynine penalty minutes was second on the
team however that was also an indication that he was fearly when facing tough
physical opponents and he was at his best when playing physically  but to
become a fixture in this league he needs to improve both offensively and
defensively and cut down on the number of powerplays he gives to opponents

could we plase cease this discussion  i fail to see why people feel the need 
to expound upon this issue for days and days on end  these areas are not
 meant for this type of discussion  if you feel the need to do such things
 please take your thought elsewhere  thanks
 
i just want to second this request i value this net group as one where people
focus on solving problems and go out of their way to be respectful of
differences the hostility expressed in the original posting feels like an
assault 
 
thanks
jan 
 

   exactly my point  there is a lot of hostility to and from teenagers

   look i sent these posts here to altparentsteens with a copy to
 recautos since you people in this group may have the best advice for
 and experience with troubled teenagers

   if you follow the news for the northwest usa you will have heard that a
 group of twentyyear old boys barely out of the teens certainly their outlook
 was developed during their teens just shot and killed an innocent little
 girl riding in a car in the seattle area when her mother who was driving
 honked her horn at the car with the boys in it  this is really upsetting
 and makes my stomach turn as it would any parents   does not your heart
 just go out to that poor mother


yes fred my heart and prayers go out to the mother and others who have 
been victims of these and other senseless crimes

   you folks in this group have a responsibility to offer any good advice
 that you may have  i suspect lots of people all over the world will read
 and appreciate your comments


however i feel that you have missed the point of the previous postings see 
top  your statement of responsibility is felt as an attack towards the 
members of this group  you are attempting to make the members of this group
be required to answer  the only people who should make a statement are people
who have experienced the problem and found a workable solution

   teenagers both drive cars and are involved in automotive vandalism and
 crime  maybe someone on this newsgroup has had specific experience in
 dealing with violent teenage offenders like these kids are  at the same
 time maybe you would have some good advice for those hostile people who
 sense that are now the potential victims  maybe you would have some good
 advice for them on how not to pay back andor not make the situation worse  
 maybe you have some good advice for local authorities or schools where
 this problem is prevalent  but then again maybe you are not interested 

many people are interested but have no input  i will restate that your last
sentence here is seen as an attack on the members of this group  if people have
input they will give it  if they do not you should not make them feel 
compelled sp to respond  

if you wish to continue this conversation please send email  do not repost or
attempt to bait me i will not make another post and may i make the same a
suggestion to other group members on this matter



   thanks in advance for your help if we get any


by the way your welcome

fcushealth eight myths about national health insurance pt ii

    an office visit that is fiftytwo in seattle is eighteen in vancouver
    canada  that is because among other things they have given their
    government power to bargain with doctors and hospitals over fees

the difference in the litigation environment is reflected in the fees

lack of defensive medicine and nearabsence of malpractice is really
why we spend less using the most expensive approach of pure insurance
in canada along with france and germany without hmos  the nyt
has admitted that malpractice insurance fees are an order of magnitude
lower in canada but doctors takehome pay is almost equal to american
doctors also minimal bureaucracy cos the system is sooo simple
early march

part of the deal for using the allinsurance approach like the french
and germans do hey why do not they criticize france and germany  is
it because too many people take french and german in college to make
the accusations stick  was to preserve the doctors independance
since the provincial wings of the cma are the ones that go to bat when
the fee schedule hikes are presented the politicallybent doctors
were just cackling when they realized the cma would grow in strength
rather than diminish especially when unopposed unlike in socialized
medicine approaches like britains national health service

you have got to remember you have got a waiting list as well but it is  
not as obvious if you are poor and you do not have insurance you do not  
    go to a surgeon in the states you ration by ability to pay  

for nonlife threatening things market arguments adequately cover why
certain procedures are in scarcer demand  i have md friends who cannot
make a living as specialists back in manitoba not due to the insurance
rates but because they will not get enough customers  the cma medical
monopolys grip on doctors licencing as in the us aside  so they
must move to larger places  however this does not refute debunking
of waiting lines for urgent and routine care as has been done in the
yous by consumers reports health policy studies cited by prof dennis
e shea on usenet cnn nyt etc

doug fierro has posted a nyt article from three weeks ago about canadas
health insurance approach on talkpoliticsmedicine  there is one
small error in the article not all of our hospitals are private

would not national health insurance mean that americans who are now  
fully insured might have to settle for less  

in canada provincial insurance covers all health costs except dental  
care eyeglasses prescription drugs ambulance service and private  
hospital rooms  so many canadians do end up buying some private  
insurance a policy to cover all of these things runs about forty to forty  
a month  

of course the one thing to note is that in the canadafrancegermany
case private insurance offloaded the basic coverage to the public
sector  they realized they were keeping lowriskhighprofit extra
insurance for things like privatesemiprivate rooms vs ward
accomodation dental glasses etc for corporate or personal
benefits they will have nothing to do with you if you want to be
covered for basic care

at that point they would not even consider a voucher approach
to broker the universal coverage and sell policies to make up
the difference in the federal guidelines and market stuff

  

would not free care encourage people to run to the doctor for every  
ache and pain  

people who get free treatment do go to the doctor and hospital about  
a third more often than those who have to pay a share of their medical  
bills  

still canadians  who pay nothing at the doctors  have a lower  
perperson health bill than we do

it is free in that there are no deductibles nor copayments two
things which i advocate to make the canadian insurance look more like
real health insurance  which actually it is  i know that when
working in alberta ontario and quebec i was aware that i was paying
for health insurance  eg in toronto ohip fees were listed on my
pay stub manitoba did not collect at paycheque time but only
annually at income tax time built into the tax rate  only fiscal
naifs will proclaim that it is free along with the canadian left for
that is part of their brainwashing agenda

the french do have copayments though  france magazines summer 
one thousand nine hundred and ninetytwo edition has a fantastic presentation of their basic insurance
coverage including a sample chart of copayment percentages  for 
onethirty days you are covered for eighty of the public hospital rate one hundred
afterward  with extra private insurance you can get into a private
hospital and be covered for any differences beyond the public hospital
rate  the public insurance covers one hundred beyond thirty days or the same
cash amount for a private hospital and the difference is paid
outofpocket or according to your supplementary private insurance
over twothreerds of french have some form of extra private insurance  so
the other thirty of health costs in europe are out of private funds not
gleaned from other taxes  the gdp figures are combined public and
private expenditures for total outlay using the same methods that
yield the thirteenfourteen figure for the yous

is not the private health insurance industry just too big  
and powerful to kill  

dismantling the health segment of our insurance industry would be  
politically thorny in the quiet words of one advocate for a  
national plan some onetwo hundred firms now sell more than one hundred and ninetytwo billion in  
health insurance they would put up a hard fight not only has the industry  
grown eightfold since canada shut down its own health insurers but 
our government leaves politicians more open to lobbyists than does  
canadas parliamentary system

health insurance does exist in canada and in western europe its
just that it does not cover basic care  you can opt out in canada
and germany but you will have to go uninsured as a result because
there are too few other people that do so  ie no market

when private insurance realized how much money they would make without the
risks involved in basic insurance eg neurosurgery versus deluxe
amenities eg having to call granada tv to replace a rental set on
the fritz in someone is private hospital room they started to pat
themselves on the back for their social responsibility  in quebec
last spring a consortium of private insurers publicly warned against
any thoughts of privatizing routine low cost parts of that provinces
public health insurance plan

i would like to know if there is any new information out there about the
subject or any new studies being conducted  i am confident in my
pediatrician and her communication with the people in chapel hill but
since this is a lifelong disorder and genetically transferred i would
like keep current  i do realize that since this is a relatively new
disorder first documented in one thousand nine hundred and seventyfour in a fertility clinic in scandanavia
and is therefore controversial

i do not know a lot about this except from seeing one patient with
kartageners syndrome which is a form of immotile cilia syndrome
in which there is situs inversus bronchiectasis and chronic
infections situs inversus means that organs are on the wrong
side of the body and can be complete or partial it is interesting
medically because the normal location of organs is caused in part
by the normal rotation associated with ciliary motion so that in
absence of this laterality can be random people with situs
inversus are quite popular at medical schools because of their
rarity and the fact that most doctors get a bit upset when they
cannot find the patients heart sounds because they are on the wrong
side 

according to harrisons immotile cilia syndrom is an autosomal
recessive which should imply that on average one child in four
in a family would be affected but there may be much more current
information on this and as usual in medicine we may be talking
about more than one conditiion i would suggest that you ask your
pediatrician about contacting a medical geneticics specialist of
which there is probably one at ncsu

what is wrong with the above observation is that it explicitly gives the
impression and you may not in fact hold this view that the common perhaps
even the correct approach for a scientist to follow is to sit around
having flights of fancy and scheming on the basis of his jealousies and
petty hatreds

flights of fancy and other irrational approaches are common  the crucial
thing is not to sit around just having fantasies they are not of any use
unless they make you do some experiments  i have known a lot of scientists
whose fantasies lead them on to creative work usually they will not admit
out loud what the fantasy was prior to the consumption of a few beers

the danger in philosophizing about science is that theory and generalization 
can end up being far removed from the actual daytoday of the grunt at the
bench  yes its great to be involved in a process were i can walk into the
lab after a heavy night of dreaming and just do something for the hell of it
as long as my advisor does not catch me  which is easy enough to do but 
stamping out such behavior seems to be the purpose in life of grant review 
committees and the peer review process in general  in todays world that is 
what determines what science is what gets funded  and a damn good thing to
flights of fantasy just do not have much chance of producing anything at 
least not in biomedical research  the surest way for a graduate student to
ruin their life is to work in a lab where the boss is more concerned with 
fleshing out hisher fantasies than with having the student work on a project
that actually has a good chance of producing some results  mds seem to 
be particularly prone to this aberrant behavior  

simple example warren jelinek noticed an extremely heavy band on a dna
electrophoresis gel of human alu fragments  he got very excited hoping that
he would seen some essential part of the control mechanism for eukaryotic
genes  this fantasy led him to sequence samples of the band and carry out
binding assays  the result was a wellconserved four hundred or so bp sequence
that occurs about five hundredzero times in the human genome  unfortunately for
warrens fantasy it turns out to be a transposon that is present in
so many copies because it replicates itself and copies itself back into
the genome  on the other hand the characteristics of transposons were
much elucidated the necessity of a cellular reverse transcriptase was
recognized and the standard method of recognizing human dna was created
other species have different sets of transposons  fortunately for me
warren and i used to eat dinner at tgi fridays all the time

i have to agree with gary merrills response to this  i have read alot of the
alu and middle repetitive sequence work and it is really very interesting 
good work with implications for many fields in molecular genetics  it is 
really an example of how a well reasoned project turned up interesting 
results that were unexpected

 on february twentyfiveth the new jersey assembly voted to overturn the assault weapon
 ban in that state it looked like it might be a tight vote but the senate
 in nj was going to vote to overturn the ban it would not sit well to have
 an eastern state overturn an assault weapon ban given clintons stated
 agenda on gun control i suspect clinton gave the order to get someone or
 some group with assualt weapons and have the press present they were
 initially
 at the incident in waco to record the event for the tv audience the agent 
 on street stories reported that a supervisor was urging them all to get 
 ready fast as they know we are coming i believe this attack continued 
 even though the probablility of failure was high  because it came from the top 
 down after the nj assembly vote the atf had a limited amount of time to
 come up with something and the wackos in waco fit the bill nicely

for cites on message look up almost anything by john w olney a
toxicologist who has studied the effects of message on the brain and on
development  it is undisputed in the literature that message is an
excitotoxic food additive and that its major constituent glutamate
is essentially the premierie neurotransmitter in the mammalian brain
humans included  too much in the diet and the system gets thrown
off  glutamate and aspartate also an excitotoxin are necessary in
small amounts and are freely available in many foods but the amounts
added by industry are far above the amounts that would normally be
encountered in a ny single food  by eating lots of junk food
packaged soups and diet soft drinks it is possible to jack your
blood levels so high that anyone with a sensitivity to these
compounds will suffer numerous real physininelogical effects 
read olneys review paper in prog brain res one thousand nine hundred and eightyeight and check his
sources they are impecable there is no dispute

                    dianne murray    wcsbeauccscarletonca

in order to excitotoxin effects of message message that in blood must go through 
bloodbrain barrier that i am not sure message can go through or not

elevated levels of glu and asp in the blood are able to bypass the
bloodbrain barrier through the circumventricular organs or cvo in
particular the adeno and neurohypophysis pituitary gland areas  the
arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus and the median eminence regions
are particularly effected  cvo areas are not subject to the
bloodbrain barrier these areas control the release of gonadotropin
which controls the release and flux of steroids governing development
especially sexual development changes in adult rats which are less
sensitive to glu than humans have been observed after ingesting glu
on a chronic basis cycles of several steroids are disrupted blood
levels of somatostatin are significantly reduced and cyclic release
of steroids becomes flattened

                    hope this helps

can someone out there tell me how to switch windows screen resolution
quickly and easily  i know that i can go back into install to do it
but what i would really like is to have is the ability to just change a
couple of startup or configuration files and have the resolution
changed  i already have both video drivers that i need on my system

the subject line says it all  is it terribly difficult to get tickets
to penguins games especially now that they are in the playoffs  would
it be easy to find scalpers outside of the igloo selling tickets

there are always scalpers with tickets outside the arena  you might have
to pay a few bucks extra but you can always find them  look on the
street under the message board or out on the street in front of the hyatt
or even around gate one  the later you buy them the less money you will pay
and during the regular season you could usually find some for near face
value or below if you wait until game time  might be better to pick them
up earlier now though

 the biggest hurdle for automatics imho is not shifting speed
 per se but rather the transmissions reaction speed when you
 try to force it to shift manually  
 

i rented an oldsmobile achieva is that a yuppie name or what and a
nissan stanza  they both had automatics  i am a manual transmission
bigot but i have to admit that the transmissions on these cars were
better shifters than i am  and yes they responded very quickly to
kickdown requests  the nissan had a tachometer so i was able to figure
out which gear i was in  the olds may have also but i do not
remember  i believe it shifted all the way down to second at about fifty
mph when my foot told it no i really want to accelerate quickly

i would still prefer a manual but i will not delude myself into thinking
that i can outaccelerate a modern automatic  and i am very smooth at
shifting but certainly not as good as an automatic

i am not a lawyer so correct me if i am wrong but doing that could be
considered obstruction of justice which could land you in prison for
quite a while

the thing that is great about the secret key is it is idea encrypted so
even if the fbi do get the key they are sol unless they know the magic
word  if they try to force you to give them your pass phrase just say
oops i forgot  since the burden of proof is still on the prosecution
in this country if you keep your mouth shut how can they prove that you
did not forget your pass phrase


well i am no lawyer but i will supply some ancedotal evidence which may
change your mind   note  i do not agree at all with what went on in
this case and neither will most of you  that does not change the fact 
that it did happen  right here in america even

about three or four years ago there was a rather nasty custody case in
or around washington dc  the upshot was an exhusband was suing for 
visitation rights which were granted  the woman believed that the man
had been sexually molesting her children  much like allenfarrow but
not as famous  anyhows she spirits away the kids and refuses to tell the
court where they are and denies him visitation rights

she keeps her mouth shut and what happens  she sits in jail for almost
a year on contempt of court until the legislature passes a special law
limiting the time a person can be held  if they had not passed the law she would
most likely still be there  the kids were in new zealand i belive

now story finished commetary starting  imho the only reason the
legislature moved was because there was an outpouring of public sympathy
for this woman  most people believed she was right and were outraged
not likely to happen for joe random drug dealer child molester or perfectly
innocent privacy lover who might have something
to hide  innocent until proven guilty does not mean you get to walk out
of court humming a happy tune because the fbi cannot read your disk  just
ask those held for contempt those who cannot make bail etc etc

again i disagree totally with the concept of holding someone based
on suspicion but people who keep thinking that it will not happen are bound
to get a rude shock when it does
 

 also not a lawyer etc but if i remember correctly the contempt of court
business is used in order to compel cooperation with what is perhaps
questionably different issue the legitimate business of that court quite
literally the party is found guilty of holding the court in contempt now
the original scheme as suggested here would be to have the key disappear if
certain threatening conditions are met once the key is gone there is no
question of contempt of court as there is nothing to compell the key is no
longer there to be produced

  obstruction of justice would be a different issue but if the suspect in
question would have some legitmate reason to protect his data from prying eyes
however extenuated i think that this charge would be a hard nut to make 

  perhaps it is time for a lawyer to step in and clear this all up

  from graydon 

 if all of these things have been detected in space has anyone
 looked into possible problems with the detectors

 that is is there some mechanism cosmic rays whatever that
 could cause the dector to think it was seeing one of these
 things

 graydon

that would not explain why widely separated detectors such as on ulysses
and pvo and ginga et al would see a burst at the same time  in fact be
fore batse having this widely separated interplanetary network was the
only sure way to locate a random burst  with only one detector one cannot
locate a burst except to say it is somewhere in the field of view  with
two detectors one can use the time that the burst is seen in each detector
to narrow the location to a thin annulus on the sky  with three detectors
one gets intersecting annuli giving two possible locations  if one of these
locations is impossible because say the earth blocked that part of the 
sky voila you have an error box

batse by having eight detectors of its own can do its own location determination
but only to within about three degrees would someone at gsfc like david like
to comment on the current state of location determination  having inde
pendent sightings by other detectors helps drive down the uncertainty

you did touch on something that you did not mean to though  some believe
in a reference that i have somewhere that absorptionlike features seen
in a fraction of grbs can actually be caused by the detector  it would be
a mean nasty god though that would have a nai crystal act like a tentwelve gauss

i was my understanding that the purpose of those removeablefrontpanels
were to make the radio useless and thus discourage theft that is if the 
cover were removed by the owner and taken along whenever the car was left

if those covers were sold for anything remarkably less than the radio 
originally costs or even sold at all
then the above discouragement would not be so great

i personally would be unhappy if i bought a radio like that thinking that 
removing the cover greatly depreciated the radios value and the covers were

brettharpercimlinccom


just a thought on resources  it is very important if you do use a
multiplatform toolkit to check on how it uses resources  i have
used glockenspeil commonview under motif and ostwo  i wrote a resource
converter from ostwo to motif but it really was not too easy especially
the naming scheme in motif you cannot rename controlswidgets
with windows you can call the ok button idok in every instance
this does not work for motif you would have to call it dialogoneok
and motif expects a text string rather than a number  so 
your constructor should know how to convert a define into the
proper resource identifier
i would check on how the toolkit expects names and that if it does
use resources that is uses resources for all platforms you intend to
port to  by the way i would never use commonview or glockenspiel
for anything

the event

 the joliet mud turtles a chicago land four wheel drive club is

 for those who ask what is an onoff road rally well

  an onoff road rally consists of the following

   one an ontheroad rally where participants are given a set of
      directions and clues guiding participates around the 
      jolietplainfield area  the object is to navigate a course
      based on a set of directions and clues  participants will
      be given a set of questions pertaining to the course which
      they must answer along the way  points are awarded for the
      number of correct answers given  directions will ultimately 
      lead to an offroad area where a fourwheel drive course is 
      setup  at various locations in the onroad course checkpoints
      will be setup where participants will be asked other questions
      or requested to perform some activity eg tire roll truck tow
      basketball freethrow etc for additional points

   two an optional offroad four wheel drive course where participants

i live at sealevel and am calledupon to travel to highaltitude cities
quite frequently on business  the cities in question are at seven thousand to nine thousand
feet of altitude  one of them especially is very polluted

often i feel faint the first two or three days  i feel lightheaded and
my heart seems to pound a lot more than at sealevel  also it is very
dry in these cities so i will tend to drink a lot of water and keep
away from dehydrating drinks such as those containing caffeine or alcohol

thing is i still have symptoms  how can i ensure that my short trips there
no i do not usually have a week to acclimatize are as comfortable as possible
is there something else that i could do

a long time ago possibly two years ago there was a discussion here about
altitude adjustment  has anyone saved the messages

    i think you are proposal would work to get an extra one maybe two extra
bits of color resolution  however if you had a display that chould do only
zero or full intensity for each primary i do not think you would get great
equivalent twentyfourbit photographs

i have not suggested to do so i wrote about problems and the problem
were clearly visible with seven bit bw images not to mention twentyfour bit images

 description of experiment deleted 

if the one bit images are viewed quickly and in sync with screen
then one hundred intensities could be better than we have  i do not know

 more deleted 

in any case getting black color with slow machines is problem
i could try it on our eight bit screens but i do not know how to
render pixels with x in constant time i recall our double buffer
has other image color and one bw  that does not help either
maybe i should dump photos to screen with low level code how

a few years ago a friend and i took some two hundred and fiftysix greylevel photos from
a one bit mac plus screen using this method displaying all two hundred and fiftysix levels
synchronized to the sixtyhz display took about ten seconds after
experimenting with different aperture settings and screen
brightnesses we found a range that worked well giving respectable
contrast the quality of the images was pretty good there were no
visible contrast bands

to minimize the exposure time the display program built two hundred and fiftyfive
different one bit frames the first contained a dot only for pixels
that had value two hundred and fiftyfive the second only for pixels that had value two hundred and fiftyfour
etc these frames were stored using a sparse data structure that was
very fast to or onto the screen in sequence creating these
frames sometimes took fiveten minutes on that old mac but the camera
shutter was closed during that time anyway and yes we wrote
directly to the screen memory mea culpa

our biggest problem was that small images were displayed in the
top left corner of the screen instead of the center it took
an extra week to have the film developed and printed because the
processors took the trouble to manually move the all images into
the center of the print who would have guessed

in reference to the limits of acceleration with guns launching solid
rockets as payloads  thiokol provided me with samples and data on
a reinforcement to solid motor grains for high accelerations  solid
motor propellants usually have a substantial percentage of 
aluminum in the mix  for example the space shuttle srbs are sixteen percent
aluminum  the technique is to use a foamed aluminum structure
the structure looks like the inverse of a set of bubbles an i suspect
some bubbling process is used to form it  in other words if you made
a bunch of bubbles in molten aluminum then froze it this is what
you get  it forms a strong network of effectively aluminum wires in
all directions  the remaining solid fuel mix is infiltrated into
the voids and you get aluminumreinforced solid propellant  the
foamedaluminum makes up about six percent of the total propellant
so there is still aluminum particles in the bulk grain  the major
improvement is the higher resistance to grain cracking which is the
principal failure mode for solid propellant

bradley center in milwaukee is home to the milwaukee admirals minor leauge
hockey team  the owner of the admirals sorry i cannot remember his name
either owns or at least shelled out the majority of the funds to build the
bradley center

lloyd pettit married into allenbradley corp abcom family and owns the
admirals  he donated the bradley center and the new pettit national ice
center

supposedly he was approached by the nhl about an expansion franchise but 
turned it down because he thought the franchise fee of fifty million was too
high

this is not the way i have heard it  see lloyd as he is affectionately
referred to by milwaukeeans and bob uecker bought the bradley center to get
the nhl to come here

like i said i do not know whether this story is true or just a rumor but if
it is true do not look for an nhl team in milwaukee anytime soon  the admirals
are not going to be forced out of the building and you will not see an nhl club
and a minor league club in the same building especially since the nbas

  if we are interested of real allround players the power play stats
  should be considered too because the power play is also one aspect

i am going to any good player should score on power plays because of the man
advantage  very good power play scorers tend to become overrated
because their point totals are inflated by power play points
 tends to expose these overrated players such as brett hull

given the opportunity to play power play consistently any player can

i am not saying that conflicts started with that it is only
not one side being the aggressive and the ither always suffering
it is sad that we both still are not trying to compromise
i remember the action of the turkish government by removing the
visa requirement for greeks to come to turkey i thought it
was a positive attempt to make the relations better

 i thought it was a smart move to receive more money from greek tourists
 i bet that this week there should be about two hundredzero tourists from greece
 in turkey  each one will leave at least onezero so go and figure what this
 means to your economy  if you had kept the visa requirement how many
 greeks would bother to visit turkey

smart indeed  if what you are saying is true greeks who visit are happy
the turkish merchants are happy who is harmed  no one  so not only was
it a smart move it was also a good move for it adds to the happiness of
two hundredzero greeks per week and however many turkish merchants they interact with
one simple move in the paperwork arena  lotsa happy people of both 
nationalities  just and observation

this is the dr beter audio letterr one thousand six hundred and twentynine k st nw washington
dc  twenty thousand and six

   hello my friends this is dr beter  today is april thirty
one thousand nine hundred and eightytwo and this is my audio letterr no seventyfour

  it is now been almost one month since war broke out in the south
atlantic  on the surface it seems that it is only a dispute
between argentina and great britain over the barren windswept
falkland islands and south georgia island  in reality it is far
more than that

   the socalled falklands crisis is just the visible tip of a
giant military operation  during this month of april one thousand nine hundred and eightytwo
fierce naval battles have taken placenot only in the south
atlantic but also in the south pacific  up to now most of the
hostilities have been kept under wraps by wartime censorship on
all sides  but as i say these words the naval war in the
southern hemisphere is about to come to the surface

   beginning today april thirty a total naval and air blockade of
the falklands by the royal navy has begun  at the same time a
counterblockade has been declared by argentina in the same area

   to be effective a blockade must be imposed over a period of
time but the royal navy does not have that much time  winter is
coming on in the south atlantic and the british supply lines are
overextended  having come this far her majestys navy cannot
simply drop the blockade and sail away in a few weeks time
without drawing blood from argentina  as a result the british
will be forced to undertake military operations very soon no
matter how risky they may be

   there is also another reason why the royal navy now has no
choice but to engage the argentine forces in combat  that
reason my friends is that the royal navy has already suffered
losses in secret combat this month  up to this moment there will
be no way to explain away the damage which has been sustained by
the british fleet  only when publicly admitted fighting erupts
will the british dare to admit that they have suffered battle
losses  to obtain that cover story the british have no choice
but to sail into combat but in doing so they will be risking
even heavier losses on top of those already sustained  in short
my friends her majestys navy has sailed into a trap

   the events now unfolding in the south atlantic carry strange
ironic echoes of the past  for weeks now we have been hearing
countless commentators referring to the british task force as an
armada quote  the british of all people ought to be very
uneasy with that description  the original spanish armada four hundred
years ago was renowned as a seemingly invincible fighting force
but it came to grief in a naval disaster so complete that it
changed the course of historyand it was none other than the
english navy that destroyed the spanish armada

   the original spanish armada put to sea in one thousand five hundred and eightyeight during the
reign of englands queen elizabeth i  the armada was an invasion
fleet carrying thousands of crack fighting men to invade england 
they were met by the daring sea dogs of sir francis drake  drake
and his small fast ships turned the tables on the spanish armada
by changing the rules of battle  the english fleet was equipped
with new longerrange guns and it stayed upwind and out of
reach  from there the english pounded smashed and shattered
the big ships of the mighty armada  when it was all over barely
half the spanish fleet was left to limp back to port  drakes
defeat of the spanish armada was a shock to the world  it opened
the door for england under queen elizabeth i to start its
expansion into a truly global empire

   today four hundred years later history seems to have come full
circle  queen elizabeth ii is witnessing the dismantling of the
world empire whose heyday began under queen elizabeth i and now
the cultures of england and of spain are once again in
confrontation  once again a socalled armada is preparing for
invasion but this time the armada is british not spanish  four
hundred years ago sir francis drake was the hero of the day
today the ghost of francis drake is once again on the scene

   the south atlantic war zone is at the eastern end of the drake
passage around the southern tip of south america  the defeat of
the spanish armada four centuries ago broke the back of spains
naval supremacy and now the defeat of the new british armada may
well break the back of what remains of the once glorious royal
navy

   my three special topics for this audio letter are

topic onethe military secret of south georgia island
topic twothe secret naval war of the southern hemisphere
topic threethe rockefeller fear campaign against nuclear war

topic onewhen the falkland islands crisis began early this month
it looked at first like a tempest in a teapot  for a century and
a half since one thousand eight hundred and thirtythree the islands have been controlled by great
britain  during that entire time british sovereignty over the
falklands has been disputed by argentina  there have been
countless threats by argentina to seize the islands which it
calls the malvinas but the threats have always come to nothing
in the past and britain has never even gotten very worried about
them

   the islands are four times as distant from argentina as cuba
is from the united states and they are not much of a prize 
after one hundred and fifty years of occupancy the falklands are home to fewer
than twozero british settlers and a lot of sheep  in short the
remote falkland islands hardly look like something to fight over
and yet here we are watching another crisis take place  we are
watching as war erupts between great britain and argentina

   the thatcher government is acting as if it has forgotten all
about its usual preoccupation with the soviet threat at natos
doorstep  instead britain is throwing almost everything it is
got at argentinaaircraft carriers cruisers destroyers
submarines assault shipsyou name it  luxury cruise ships have
even been commissioned and turned into troop carriers overnight 
wave after wave of additional assault troops have been activated
and sent to join the fleet even after it sailed  ships and
submarines have been pulled off station from normal nato duty and
sent to reinforce the task force  the initial fortyship force has
grown steadily over the past several weeks into an armada
numbering over seventy  over twothirds of the entire royal navy has
already been deployed to the south atlantic off argentina

   watching all this a lot of people are asking what is this
fight really all about  the most popular answer suggested in the
major media is oil  vast deposits of oil are known to exist
under the continental shelf between argentina and the falklands
but that has been known for nearly ten years  in no way does it
explain the timing of the sudden military offensive by argentina
this month and oil explains even less about the argentine
seizure of south georgia island

   south georgia island is eight hundred miles east of the falklands with
no known oil deposits anywhere near it and compared to south
georgia the falklands are an island paradise  south georgia
island is covered with rugged mountains treacherous valleys
glaciers and semipermanent snow  most of it is uninhabitable 
on top of all that argentina has absolutely no legal or
historical claim to south georgia island  in that respect it
stands in sharp contrast to the falklands

   in the early one thousand eight hundred and thirtys the falklands were occupied for a while by
argentine colonists  in one thousand eight hundred and thirtythree the british expelled them and took
over the island  for that and other historical reasons
argentina argues that the falklands really belong to argentina
not britain

   but no such argument is possible for south georgia island  it
has always been controlled by britain never by argentina or
spain  the argentine seizure of south georgia island looks even
more unreasonable from a military point of view  argentinas
leaders are military men and they think in military terms  they
were well aware ahead of time that faroff south georgia island
could not possibly be held for long  by seizing it they were
setting themselves up to absorb a military defeat as the island
was retaken by britain  so the question is why did argentinas
military junta bother with the seemingly worthless south georgia
island at all

   my friends the answers to all these questions are military
not political or economic  south georgia island possesses an
enormous military secret  it is a giant underground installation
buried under the mountains at the northwest end of the island 
the real reason for the socalled falkland crisis is this secret
installation together with two other similar installations which
i will describe shortly

   the secret military complexes have been in existence for many
years they are not new  what is new is the accelerated nuclear
war timetable of the american bolshevik war planners here in
washington  for the past two months i have been reporting the
details of this new war plan to you as quickly as i can obtain
and verify them

   the plan calls for nuclear war one to erupt by september of
this year one thousand nine hundred and eightytwo  it is this fastapproaching nuclear war threat
that caused the socalled falklands crisis to erupt now

   what is going on now is a coordinated effort to spoil part of
the bolshevik grand strategy for the coming nuclear war  the
mutual enemies of the american bolsheviks herenamely the
rockefeller carteland russias new rulers in the kremlin are
behind the present crisis  they are trying to ruin phase three of
the project z war plan which i revealed last month  that phase
is to be world domination by the american bolsheviks after both
russia and the united states have been destroyed in nuclear war
one  as i mentioned last month the key to this plan is the
existence of secret weapons stockpiles in various places around
the world

   the american bolshevik military planners here in america are
working with other bolshevik agents in key military positions of
other countries to set off war  having done that they intend to
ride out the nuclear holocaust they have caused safe and cozy in
government war bunkers  when the warring nations finally lie
smoldering and exhausted the bolsheviks will leave the shattered
remains of their host countries  they will rendezvous at the
secret weapons installations and bring their weapons into the
open  they will confront the world with the only remaining
fresh uptodate powerful military force on earth and using
that military power they will become the undisputed rulers of
the worldthat is they plan to do all this and they plan to
pave the way for world domination very soon by setting off
nuclear war one in a matter of months  the rockefeller cartel
and russias new antibolshevik rulers are working together in a
race against time to try to head off the bolshevik war plan

   last month i mentioned that the bolsheviks here are
benefitting from war preparations which were started by the
rockefellers long ago  it has only been about three years since
the rockefellers were dislodged as the prime movers of the united
states government by the bolsheviks  since that time the united
states government has been a house divided torn by internal
power struggles between rival bolshevik and rockefeller factions 
but before that the united states had been dominated for decades
both economically and politically by the four rockefeller
brothers

   in one thousand nine hundred and sixtyone the brothers launched a new longrange plan for world
domination  it was a twoprong strategy half visible and half
secret which i first described long ago in audio letter no twentyeight 
it was a plan for the united states to arm to the teeth in secret
while appearing to disarm gradually  without repeating all the
details the basic idea was grandiose yet simple  by
deliberately appearing weak the rockefellercontrolled united
states would maneuver itself into a nuclear war with russia 
then the secret weapons including superweapons would be
unleashed to smash russia and take over the world

   when they set the grand plan in motion in one thousand nine hundred and sixtyone the
rockefeller brothers were looking ahead to a nuclear war by the
late one thousand nine hundred and seventys  their military analysts concluded very early that
the war being planned would have very different effects on the
northern and southern hemispheres  both superpowers the united
states and the soviet union are located well up in the northern
hemisphere so are the other fullfledged nuclear powersgreat
britain france red china and india  by contrast the
strategic targets for nuclear war in the southern hemisphere are
relatively few and far between  in other words it was expected
that the coming nuclear war would be essentially a northern
hemisphere war

   in an allout nuclear holocaust it is known that serious
radioactive fallout will gradually spread to affect even areas
not initially hit by war  but there are limits to how far the
war clouds can spread  it was discovered long ago that there is
very little mixing between the air of the northern and southern
hemispheres  in the northern half of our planet cold air from
the north pole works its way southward towards the equator then
it works its way back to the north as warm air  a mirror image
of this process takes up the southern half of the planet 
northern and southern hemisphere air meet in the equatorial zone
but very little of the air changes places

   the military conclusion my friends is this the coming
nuclear war could ruin large areas of the northern hemisphere for
generations to come but if the calculations are right the
southern hemisphere could escape virtually unaffected by the war 
this was music to the ears of the four rockefeller brothers  a
quick look at the globe of the world shows why  the rockefeller
cartel has dominated latin america ever since world war ii  as i
discussed in my very first monthly audio letter nelson
rockefeller solidified the cartel grip on latin america during
the war  he accomplished this as socalled coordinator of
hemispheric defense for thenpresident franklin d roosevelt 
so that takes care of the south american continent and its
natural resources

   then there is the african continent  there too rockefeller
control was already in effect over wide areas of black africa
especially south of the equator  all this was thanks to the
efforts of john d rockefeller iii as i detailed in audio letter
no thirtysix

   looking around the globe the most important remaining land
masses from the standpoint of world domination are australia and
new zealand  thanks to world war ii both were wide open to the
rockefellers

   the rockefeller brothers decided to establish secret military
installations in the southern hemisphere for use after the coming
war  by this means they expected to become the masters of the
surviving southern half of planet earth after the northern
hemisphere war  then as the northern hemisphere gradually
recovered from the nuclear holocaust the rockefeller empire
would be able to pick up the pieces  in this way the third
generation rockefeller brothers expected their family dynasty to
inherit the earth

   in order to control the southern hemisphere militarily after
the war some means would have to be available to project
military power onto any land mass  for example revolts against
rockefeller domination would require troopsnot a blast from the
beam weapons on the moon  the most critical factor for postwar
military domination of the world was found to be a navy  a
minimum of two secret naval fleets would be requiredone based
in the south atlantic the other in the south pacific  since the
reserve naval fleets were to be kept secret until after the
northern hemisphere nuclear war they could not be built in
existing shipyards  new construction facilities had to be built
and they had to be hidden  to hide an entire shipyard is no
small task they take up a lot of space  on top of that it was
essential that the ships remain hidden after they were built 
the best way to achieve that was to combine the shipyard and
naval base into one overall secret installation  finally the
secret naval installation had to be invulnerable to nuclear
attack otherwise if its existence were ever discovered
prematurely the secret navy might be wiped out

   the combined requirements for secrecy space and protection
against attack were formidable but one day in one thousand nine hundred and fiftynine while all
these plans were still in the early stages of development the
answer presented itself  during a socalled banking trip to
sweden david rockefeller was given a tour of a unique hidden
naval port  the port is hollowed out from solid granite cliffs
which come right down to the water  the entrance to the port is
a gigantic hole in the side of the cliff which can be sealed off
with enormous steel doors  inside this big doorway on the water
a huge cavity has been hollowed out to accommodate ships

   the rockefeller brothers and their military adviser decided
that a bigger more secret better protected version of the
swedish hidden port was just what they wanted  a survey of
candidate sites was then initiated  the site survey covered
coastal areas throughout the southern hemisphere  many areas
were rejected very quickly because the topography was wrong 
other areas were rejected because they were too close to the
equator  still others had to be ruled out because there were too
many people living nearby making the desired level of secrecy
impossible  finally it was essential that the sites chosen for
the secret naval installations be totally secure politically

   at last the sites for the secret naval installations were
selected  in the south pacific extreme southern new zealand was
selected  this is what i was alluding to in audio letter no seventyone
three months ago when i called attention to new zealands extreme
importance in the coming war

   in order to obtain the necessary space the secret new zealand
naval installation had to be divided up into two sites located
close together  one is at the extreme southwest tip of south
island where the mountain range known as the southern alps comes
down virtually to the waters edge  the other part of the
installation is built into the northwest tip of stewart island
which is off the tip of south island  the stewart island
facility is hollowed out within a rise known as mt anglem

   the new zealand location met all the requirements  ever since
world war ii the government of new zealand has been tied even
closer to the united states than to great britain  the location
is far from the equator and the installations are buried deep
under mountains protected from nuclear attack  they are also
too deep to be reached by particlebeam attacks and the new
zealand site is well situated to command the entire south
pacific

   in the south atlantic an even more perfect site was found 
that site my friends is south georgia island  it is located
perfectly for naval domination of the entire south atlantic  the
tall rugged mountains provided a perfect location for the secret
installation at the northwest tip of the one hundredmile long island 
it is controlled by great britain whose government like that of
new zealand was willing to cooperate and south georgia island
was virtually uninhabited except for a whaling station on the
northeast coast  the whaling station was some fifty miles away from
the secret new installation which was being built but britain
took no chances  in one thousand nine hundred and sixtyfive the whaling station was closed down 
since that time there have been no inhabitants on south georgia
island except for a few dozen alleged antarctic scientists

   construction of the secret naval facilitiestwo in new
zealand one on south georgia islandbegan in the early one thousand nine hundred and sixtys 
the techniques were adapted from those used previously to build
other large underground facilities such as the norad
installation inside cheyenne mountain colorado however these
techniques were adapted in radically new ways to achieve
construction access directly from the sea instead of overland 
in this way the sheltering mountain was left undisturbed in
appearance both during and after construction

   the cuts in the mountain side which were necessary to let
ships in and out were kept as small as possible and were well
camouflaged  like the swedish hidden naval port arrangement the
entrances to the secret installations can be sealed up  when
sealed the entrance is virtually impossible to detect unless you
know exactly where it is and unlike most large construction
projects there are no tailings or piles of leftover rock lying
around to attract attention  the manmade caverns which house
the secret naval installations are enormous but all the rock and
debris was disposed of at sea

   once the secret naval facilities were built they had to be
outfitted for ship construction and docksite storage  the fake
disarmament of the united states during the one thousand nine hundred and sixtys contributed
greatly to this task  from one thousand nine hundred and sixtyone to one thousand nine hundred and sixtyeight one man played a pivotal
role in this elaborate rockefeller scheme  he was thensecretary
of defense robert mcnamara  all through the sixtys mcnamara
presided over the public paring back of americas visible
military power  this included the closing down and dismantling
of entire shipyards  what we were not told was where all that
shipyard equipment went afterwards  where it went my friends
was to the new secret installations which were being outfitted in
new zealand and south georgia island

   the secret naval installations have been used as duplication
facilities to reproduce certain ships and submarines designed and
built here in the united states  as defense secretary caspar
weinberger told congress recently it is cheaper to build two
ships at a time  that is especially true if the second ship is
an exact duplicate of the first  this has become even more true
in recent years through the use of computerized manufacturing
techniques

   the secret naval fleets which have been built at the secret
installations are made up of duplicatesexact duplicates of
certain other ships and submarines  they are all nuclear
powerednuclear subs nuclear cruisers nuclear destroyers
and yes nuclear aircraft carriers three of them  a secret twin
was built for the youss nimitz for the youss eisenhower and
for the newlylaunched youss carl vincent  all have been
financed through the gigantic cost overruns so called that we
constantly hear about in the defense department and all three
carriers have been provided with a full complement of aircraft
whose manufacture was financed the same way

   the ships of the secret american bolshevik naval fleets are
all duplicates of other nuclearpowered vessels  even so the
secret naval ships possess one key difference

   last month i revealed that the socalled stealth program has
succeeded in developing a kind of electromagnetic invisibility
shield  this technique makes an object invisible from a distance
by distorting light waves in its vicinity

   a whole new fleet of phantom warplanes are now going into
crash production that use this principle and my friends all of
the secret american bolshevik navy ships have already been
outfitted with similar stealthfield equipment  the stealth
principle is actually easier to apply to ships than to airplanes
because there is more room for the powerful equipment that
generates the field

   after nuclear war one the secret stealth navy of the american
bolsheviks would be light years ahead of any other navy left on
earth  it would be perfect for the intended role of world
domination  the rockefellers set it all in motion long ago my
friends but three years ago they lost control of the united
states military  now it is the american bolsheviks who are in
control and they are bent on war

   these secret naval installations have precipitated what is
being called the falklands crisis

topic twoin audio letterr no seventythree last month i described
project z the new bolshevik threephase strategy for nuclear
war one

   an elite group of american bolshevik military planners here
are flushing out the plan right now at a secret warroom here in
washington  it is a plan by which the united states will strike
the first nuclear blow followed by allout thermonuclear war
with russia

   having set off the holocaust the bolsheviks here and in
certain other countries plan to rise it out safe in comfortable
war bunkers  finally after nuclear war one fizzles out in
stalemate they plan to leave behind the ashes of the united
states and her allies  activating phase three of their grand
strategy they plan to unveil their secret weapons especially
their secret naval fleets  with these they plan to conquer and
rule what is left of the world  the united states as we know it
will be dead and gone but in the eyes of the bolsheviks
themselves this outcome will constitute victory

   up to now the nuclear war timetable which i first revealed two
months ago is still on track  they are still shooting for
nuclear war to begin by september of this year one thousand nine hundred and eightytwo  time is
fast running out

   the bolsheviks here are sprinting as fast as they can toward
war but my friends the bolsheviks are not the only runners in
this race  they have two deadly enemies both of whom are
equally determined to trip up the bolsheviks  one enemy of the
bolsheviks here is the rockefeller cartel the other enemy is the
new antibolshevik ruling clique in russia and now these two
mutual enemies of the bolsheviks are pooling their efforts in
certain ways

   in audio letter no seventyone three months ago i reported that a
limited new antibolshevik coalition was in the works between
the rockefeller cartel and the russians  the january twentysix meeting
between haig and gromyko in geneva switzerland was a turning
point in the formation of this coalition  it is now a reality
and is responsible for the socalled falkland crisis now
dominating the headlines  it should be emphasized that this new
relationship between the rockefeller cartel and russia falls far
short of a true alliance  they have very major disputes to be
settled between them but for the time being they have called a
truce between themselves to deal with their mutual deadly
enemythe bolsheviks here in america

   the first priority of the russians and the rockefellers is to
slow down the bolshevik preparations for imminent nuclear war 
if they can do that time is on the side of the rockefeller
cartel in certain political movements which i discussed last
summer in audio letter no sixtyseven  a slowdown in the nuclear war
timetable will also give more breathing space for additional
antibolshevik actions to be implemented

   the joint rockefellerrussian planners decided by midfebruary
that military action against the bolsheviks was essential very
quickly  no other type of action had any hope of taking effect
fast enough to prevent nuclear war by the end of this summer

   the exact details of the project z war plan are not known to
either the rockefellers or the russians but the general outlines
are known to be as i described last month

   it was decided that military action should be devised that
would undermine phase three of the bolshevik war planthat is the
bolshevikcontrolled secret naval installations and fleets in the
southern hemisphere should be attacked and crippled  by working
together the rockefeller cartel and the russians were able to
devise an attack plan which neither could have carried out alone 
the rockefeller group who built and originally controlled these
bases provided detailed intelligence about the best way to
attack them  the russians with their enormous military machine
provided the muscle to actually carry out the attack

   it was essential to devise a scheme that would enable both
secret fleets in the south atlantic and south pacific to be
attacked  survival intact of either fleet would leave the
bolshevik war plan still workable

   military analysts concluded very quickly that a direct assault
on the new zealand facilities was out of the question  there was
no combination of commandos frogmen or other military force
which could possibly keep an attack secret from the outside
world  any attack on the new zealand bases would set off the
very war which the rockefellers and russians want to prevent

   but the situation in the south atlantic was a different
matter  in a way the greatest asset of south georgia island was
also its achilles heel  the extreme isolation which protected
the secrecy of the south georgia base also made a covert military
assault feasible  the key lay with argentina and her
longstanding claims to the falkland islands

   as i mentioned in topic one the rockefeller cartel has
dominated all of latin america for decades  cartel operatives
were sent to argentina to work out a deal with the government
military junta there  the historic dispute over the falkland
islands was to be used to provide a ruse a military cover to
enable the south georgia base to be attacked  the argentine
generals were not told everything about the situation by any
means but they were told enough to make clear what they were to
do

   as an inducement to cooperate the argentine leaders were
promised handsome rewards  they were guaranteed that after the
shooting was over the falkland islands would remain in argentine
hands  this guarantee included the promise of covert military
assistance as needed against the royal navy  and to bolster the
troubled argentine economy it was promised that the rockefeller
cartel will help develop the immense offshore oil reserves  with
these combined promises of military glory and financial rewards
the argentine military junta agreed to the plan

   on march nineteen argentina carried out act one in the joint attack
plan  a group of argentine scrapmetal merchants of all things
landed at the abandoned old whaling station on south georgia
island  supposedly they were there to dismantle the old
buildings and cart them off to sell  while they were at it they
also raised the argentine flag over the worksite  the british
always nervous about south georgia island promptly reacted as
expected  the british antarctic survey ship endurance put twentytwo
marines ashore  they drove off the scrap merchants and tore down
the argentine flag

   the incident provided the desired excuse for the argentine
junta to bring the simmering one hundred and fiftyyearold falklands dispute to a
boil  from time to time in the past argentina has claimed that
south georgia is part of the falklands because it is administered
that way by britain  that argument is very flimsy but it now
came in very handy  it was nothing new to hear this from
argentine leaders so there was no hint of what was really afoot

   during late march argentine military forces started
assembling for an assault on the falklands  nothing new
thought the british high command  argentina has carried out
threatening maneuvers in the past many times  it was believed
that they were about to do it again but on april two argentine
forces did the unexpected  after many past false alarms this
time they actually invaded and seized the islands  all argentine
public statements emphasized the longstanding historical claims
to the falklands themselves but just for good measure the next
day a small argentine force also seized faroff south georgia
island  the force was so small that it gave the appearance
initially that it was just a side show from argentinas point of
view however the small contingent of twentytwo royal marines were
overpowered and bundled off the island along with a group of thirteen
alleged scientists  that was the moment of payoff in the joint
rockefellerrussian attack plan

   thanks to the elaborate distraction staged by the argentine
forces a special commando team got onto the island undetected 
based on the detailed rockefeller information about the base the
team moved to a location on the mountain directly above the
cavernous secret base  special highspeed drilling equipment was
set up by the rockefeller members of the team while the russian
members concentrated on military defense  by late that evening
april three the military high command in london finally learned what
was really taking place  the secret south georgia base was under
attack by virtually the only means possible  the joint
rockefellerrussian team were drilling a shaft down through the
mountain toward the hollowed out cavern inside  it was only a
matter of time until their drill would break through the ceiling
of the giant hidden naval base  once the hole was made the next
step was obvious  the rockefellerrussian team would put a
weapon of some kind through the hole  the best guess was that it
would be a nerve gas

   the shock waves that went through the highest levels of the
british government on the evening of april three can hardly be
described my friends  the thatcher government like the
socalled reagan administration here in america is bolshevik
controlled  that is why margaret thatcher always says me too
any time the reagan administration says or does anything against
russia  both governments are party to the secret nuclear war
plan in complete betrayal of the people of their respective
countries and on the evening of april three they suddenly discovered
that their precious war plan was in deep deep trouble

   immediately the thatcher government started assembling a naval
armada to sail for the south atlantic  haste was the order of
the day  the drilling on south georgia island was proceeding
around the clock  the best estimates were that the drilling
would break through into the roof of the naval base in about
three weeks on or about april twentyfour  if help did not reach south
georgia by then the secret installation might be doomed  the
forces stationed at the installation itself were unable to defend
themselves under the circumstances  their mighty naval ships
were ships in a bottle  they did not dare open the bottle to
sail out to fight because the russian commandos were armed with
tactical and nuclear weapons  to open the blastproof entrance
doors would be suicide

   on april five just two days after south georgia island was
seized some forty naval ships began moving out of british ports 
the same day lord carrington was sacked as foreign minister  he
was forced to resign my friends because he had assisted the
rockefeller attack plan by downplaying the argentine attack
preparations

   that same day april five new zealand the home of the other
secret naval fleet broke diplomatic relations with argentina 
the two hidden new zealand facilities had been placed on red
alert  as a precautionary measure all submarines at the twin
base were ordered to sea  several surface ships were already at
sea undergoing sea trials but that still left seven seven major
ships inside the hidden twin naval base including one of the
nuclear aircraft carriers i mentioned earlier

   on that busy day of april five argentinas foreign minister
costa mendez was at the united nations in new york  he was
alarmed by the deployment of such a large part of the royal navy 
costa mendez hurried here to washington to seek reassurances from
certain officials  he got them

   for the next two weeks or so the news was filled with stories
about the allegedly slow movement of the british fleet while
negotiations went on  that my friends was only a cover story 
the royal navy was actually joining up and moving as rapidly as
possible toward south georgia island  if the task force arrived
in time to save the secret base a major battle was likely  the
official stories about slow movement of the british armada were
intended to give a cushion of time for that battle  if need be
the fleet would have several days to retake south georgia island
then it could move on to arrive near the falklands on the
announced schedule  in this way the crucial importance of south
georgia island would be hidden and the big secret preserved

   it was initially expected that advance elements of the british
fleet would reach the vicinity of south georgia island within two
weeks  that would have been soon enough to attack the joint
rockefellerrussian commando team and stop the drilling before it
was completed  but russian cosmospheres and submarines made a
shambles of the plan

   key advance elements of the south georgia attack contingent
left ascension island early april fourteen two days before it was
announced officially  shortly after they did so they ran into
trouble  russian cosmospheres and attack submarines closed in on
a single ship which was critical to the planned counterassault on
south georgia island  the cosmospheres bombarded the bridge and
combat information center of the ship with neutron radiation  in
moments the ship was without any command its communications and
radar silenced  then a russian sub closed in and quickly
finished off this key british ship with torpedoes  it broke
apart with secondary explosions and sank rapidly  so far as is
known there were no survivors

   this unexpected shock in the midatlantic produced two
results both important

first it caused a slowdown in the race toward the south atlantic
by the british armada  the task force had to be regrouped into a
configuration better suited for an enroute defense but that cost
valuable time  public announcements from london about the
progress of the fleet reflected this slowdown  the timetable for
arrival on battle stations near the falklands started stretching
out longer and longer  all this bought extra time for the joint
commando team on south georgia island  the drilling continued

the other result of the sinking was equally important  word was
flashed to the south pacific stealth navy to prepare for possible
action  it was obvious that the russian navy was getting
involved in the atlantic which meant that the royal navy could
be in big trouble  during the dead of night early april fifteen the
seven stealth ships put to sea from their twin secret bases in
southern new zealand  they deployed to a secret operational
headquarters area in the antipodes islands four hundred and fifty miles southeast
of new zealand  their electromagnetic shields were operating to
provide protection from attack  these shields make it impossible
to communicate with the outside world or even to see it as i
explained last month but once they arrived at the antipodes the
stealth ships hooked up to buoys equipped with shielded
communication cables to the island headquarters  the antipodes
headquarters in turn was in constant touch with the south
georgia base by way of a transoceanic cable around the tip of
south america  the deployment of the available ships of the
south pacific stealth fleet was exactly what the joint
rockefellerrussian planners had hoped for  the ships had been
flushed out from their essentially invulnerable hiding place in
new zealand

   the british ships sinking of april fourteen was also followed by
other events  on april fifteen the argentine navy started moving out
of port  the same day alexander haig arrived again in buenos
aires  supposedly he was there as a diplomat but in reality he
was there as a general dealing with generals  haig is the top
governmental operative of the rockefeller cartel as i have
revealed in the past  he was making sure that the argentines did
not get cold feet and back down at that critical moment  four
days later april nineteen haig left for washington  as he boarded
his plane haig somberly told reporters time is running out 
and so it was my friends for the secret south georgia base

   the very next day april twenty the drill broke through into the
hollowedout cavern of the naval base  bolshevik military
analysts in london had not expected that it could be completed
until at least the following weekend  the british fleet was
still out of range

   the weapon which the commando team inserted down through the
long hole was a small compact russian neutron bomb  when it was
detonated inside the confines of the huge artificial cave the
effects were devastating  the intense radiation instantly killed
everyone inside the base  also the heat and blast effects of the
bomb are believed to have damaged all the ships inside
sufficiently to badly disable them

   meanwhile russian cosmospheres and submarines were converging
on the stealth ships which were near the antipodes islands
awaiting orders  from a distance the ships were invisible to
the eye due to their protective shields which also protect
against beamweapon attack but they were sitting ducks for the
tactics which the russians employed

   floating overhead the cosmospheres located the seven ships
using their psychoenergetic rangefinding equipment known as prf 
as i have reported in the past there is no method known by which
prf can be jammed  the cosmospheres radioed the exact locations
of the ships to the attack submarines  the subs were armed
with special nonhoming nonnuclear torpedoes designed to
explode on impact  more sophisticated torpedoes would have been
thrown off course or detonated prematurely by the protective
shield of each ship but these simple torpedoes just cruise right
through each invisibility field to strike the ship and explode 
within fifteen minutes after the attack began all seven bolshevik
stealth ships were on their way to the bottom and with them went
their bolshevik commanders and mercenary crews collected from
around the world

   the south pacific action took place just after sunset local
time  the time here in washington was around twozero pm april twentythree 
that evening secretary of state haig was seen briefly in public
with the new british foreign minister francis pym  pym was
wearing the artificial pseudosmile which diplomats are taught
always to display in public  but not haig  haig was grinning
from ear to ear and no wonder  the joint rockefellerrussian
military operation had been a brilliant success  the secret
bolshevik south atlantic fleet had been virtually wiped out
bottled up inside south georgia island and the south pacific
fleet while not totally wiped out had been badly crippled  by
working together the rockefeller cartel and the russians had won
the secret naval war of the southern hemisphere

topic threeas i say these words news reports give the impression
that war is about to erupt in the south atlantic but the real
war in the southern hemisphere is already over  what we are
watching now is the beginning of its bloody aftermath  that
aftermath is the battle for the falkland islands  they have been
promised to argentina as a reward for her role in the secret war

   at this moment the bolsheviks here in washington are pressing
for a public announcement that the united states will side with
britain  as soon as that takes place military action will heat
up fast around the falklands  britain has no choice but to
fight  she has already suffered casualties which cannot be
explained without a public battle but by fighting the
bolsheviks in britain are running the risk of a humiliating and
tragic defeat for the royal navy

   meanwhile the rockefeller strategists here are now
concentrating on a fastbuilding antinuclearwar campaign  on
all sides now we are hearing about the socalled nuclear freeze
movement  there are documentaries articles publicity of all
kinds to sensitize us to the terrors of nuclear war  in recent
months there have even been referenda popping up on election
ballots dealing with the nuclear war issue  medical doctors are
banding together to warn the public about what would happen if
there were a nuclear war

   we are being told that all this is just popping up
spontaneously  we are now thirtyseven years into the nuclear age and
nothing like this has ever gained so much momentum before yet
now we are supposed to believe that millions of americans have
spontaneously gotten the same ideas at the same time  if you
believe that my friends i give up  movements like this never
and i mean never develop without leadership organization and
moneyand plenty of it

   what we are watching is the rockefeller public relations
machine at work  as i have explained in the past the rockefeller
cartel cannot afford to let a nuclear war take place  if it
does they will lose everything because they are not in a
position to control it  instead the deadly enemies of the
rockefeller cartel the bolsheviks here will win out if there is
a war and so the rockefeller faction is now doing everything in
its power to prevent a nuclear war

   the present antinuclearwar orientation of the rockefeller
cartel creates certain temporary common interests between them
and russia but as russias new rulers know very well this does
not spring from any great moral perspective on the part of the
rockefeller group  it is purely a matter of practical necessity
right now for the rockefellers

   the russians regard the united states as a house divided and
they are exploiting that division by working in careful ways with
the rockefellers  their first priority is to rid the world of
the deadly bolshevik menace of allout even suicidal nuclear
war but once that is done they know that there will be a day of
reckoning with the rockefeller cartel some day

   the rockefeller group is working toward a definite objective
with their new antinuclearwar propaganda  that objective is
renewed powerand power that moves them closer to their old
dream of world government  the bolsheviks here have unwittingly
provided fertile ground for the powerful new rockefeller antiwar
campaign  under bolshevik control the socalled reagan
administration has become so hawkish that it is scaring people 
the rockefeller antiwar campaign is designed to capitalize on
that latent fear as a tool of power

   these days the smell of war is in the air  the falklands
crisis is helping to make that more intense  the rockefeller
propaganda machine is now paving the way for the argument that
surrender of sovereignty is the only way to avoid war  a new
superunited nations of sorts is now in the works to fill the
bill  it will have teeth  as presently envisioned the new
organization will be based in geneva switzerland  the working
name though this may be changed is the world nonproliferation
council  the plan is to bring it into being as the outgrowth of
nuclear nonproliferation treaties but its true purpose will be
to use fearthe fear of warto control us all

                       last minute summary

   now it is time for my last minute summary  in this audio
letter i have reported on the reasons behind the socalled
falkland islands crisis  the crisis erupted because of secret
bolshevikcontrolled naval installations in the southern
hemisphere  these have been attacked by joint action of the
rockefeller cartel and the russians in an attempt to slow down
the nuclearwar timetable  the attacks were successful but the
results remain to be seen  one result though is that the royal
navy has now been drawn into a trap  britains waterloo at sea
may well be at hand

   my friends two factions are struggling for control over our
united statesthe rockefeller cartel and the bolsheviks  they
differ in style but both seek to control us through fear  if we
are ever to rise above their trickery it must be through the
power of our lord jesus christ our only hope  as the scripture
tells us our lord has not given us the spirit of fear but
of power of love and of a sound mind  we must learn to wage
peace  as our lord declared long ago blessed are the
peacemakers for they shall be called sons of god

   until next month god willing this is dr beter  thank you
and may god bless each and every one of you

in article  maartenvanlooncwinl maarten van loon writes
hello fellownetters and fellow christians
about the subject of unity between christians and christian churches
to a bible study group alltough i do have a personal opinion on this
issue i thought it would be nice to hear opinions of fellow christian
brothers and sisters from different countries and in different situations

my background member of a orthodox reformed church let us say a little
the only unity i have found which is true is when all parties involved are
disciples  i came out of a church in which even the different
congregations were always competing and arguing about which one was
better and who had the better messages while none of them put anything
into practice from those messages  since becoming a disciple i have
found that when i travel to another church in the same movement they
are just as accepting there as any other  we had a retreat back in
january when some of the congregation from louisville ky came up this
retreat was for college students and it was as though i had known even
the people from louisville for years and i had only become a disciple
the previous april and had never been to the church in kentucky  one
of the keys to unity is unselfish love and selfsacrifice  that is only
one area in which disciples stand out from christians  also another
part of unity is a common depth of conviction  i have also been a part of
some christian campus fellowships who were focused on unity between
churches and saw that those churches had one thing involved  a lack of
conviction about everything they believed  that was why they could be
unified they did not care about the truth but delighted in getting along
together

the problem here in the netherlands is that there are two other churches
denominations with the same characteristics both have the same
confessions there are only some differences with respect to  for
example  the matter of appropriation of salvation and how to use
our creeds in essence a lot of people of these three churches have to
same faith and feel that they should become one church but how that is
the question

creeds  what need is there of creeds when the bible stands firmly
better

so here is a first question
 can the congregation of christ be separated by walls of different
  denominations or is this definitely an untolerable situation
  according to the scriptures

according to the scriptures splits and differences of opinion are going
to be there  as per a previous note i mentioned that there are those
who teach falsely by many means  there are also differences of opinion
and belief  however scripture states  
   in the following directives i have no praise for you for your
meetings do more harm than good  in the first place i hear that when
you come together as a church there re divisions among you and to some
extent i believe it  no doubt there have to be differences among you to
show which of you have gods approval one corinthians elevenseventeennineteen

how will god show his approval  by fruitfulness see acts twofortyseven but
before that there are these qualities
   devotion to the apostles teaching
   fellowship
   communion
   filling with awe for god
   all having everything in common
   glad and sincere hearts
   praising god
   enjoying the favor of the people
all these are mentioned in acts twofortytwofortyseven  god also shows that those who
have these qualities are persecuted  look at stephen a man full of
faith and of the holy spirit acts sixfive who was later stoned acts
sevenfiftyfoursixty  

 can one say that only one of these three churches is the
  true church of jesus christ

one can say that a church is the true church only if that church is
perfect not only in the congregation but worldwide as a movement  i
have yet to find that but the closest one i have found is the boston
church of christ movement which constantly strives to have errors
pointed out and corrected  it is also the only one i have seen which is
totally sold out to god


a problem closely related to these question is
 can we cooperate with other christians  from these two churches  
  before there is a unity this question is especially important
  for those who think that only one church can be the true one

as for cooperation that can always occur  unity on the other hand may
never occur  as for those who think about only one church being the
true one i remind them that mark ninethirtyeightfortyone states that there are
disciples who are not a part of the main group to begin with but they
will not lose their reward  as with the boston movement i have heard
numerous times this exact same thing that there are disciples out there
that are not a part of the boston movement but that does not make them
any less disciples  of course few people admit that they have ever run
into someone who has the qualities of a disciple outside the movement
i know i have not

maybe this last problem sounds a little strange to most of you
for your information we have a lot of organizations here which
are founded by people of one specific church and whose members
are all members of that church this has been considered as
correct for years only a few years ago people started to
discuss about this and now we are in the middle of this process
some organizations are opening their doors for people from
other churches etc

i must warn that this sounds cliquey to me  a clique is a group which
runs around together to some extent exclusively  this causes problems
in fellowship and causes divisions  i would not say at all that this is
something correct for a churchgroup to do for any reason  in one of
the churches i attended for example there was an internal clique of
people who were on the fourteen different groupscommitteesorganizational
heads of the congregation  they rarely talked to anyone else outside of
the committees and seldom were voted out of office without another
office being opened up so that they would have to step right back in
their degree of exclusion was such that when the new pastor came he
nearly had to wipe out everything and start from scratch i wish he
would have since they still have no clue about what it means to be a
disciple  anyway this rigidity in the clique is beginning to be
broken down but is still there  so i must warn against such division
within  there is enough division without

thanks for your opinions in advance

subject re my gun is like my american express card
organization university of tennessee division of continuing education
lines one hundred and thirtyfour

in article  thomas parsli  writes
overall crime rate
it felljust like that

       two questions  when was this and do you have the relevant
numbers  please note this is not in any way an indication i do not
believe you or that you are not correct but when the drop occured is
relevant
   
acquiring weapons in norway
you can buy almost all kinds of weapons in norway but you must have a 
permit and a good reason to get the permit
if i would like to have a handgun i would have to get an gunlicence from 
the police and to be a member of a gunclub

       the primary objection beyond ones based on the ideal of
rkba that it is simply not something the government should do is
that it makes guns a plaything and tool of the rich and connected
it discriminates against the poor

       is selfdefense considered appropriate and if so under what
conditions  are you allowed for instance to get a gun for protection
if you are going to be carrying a very large sum of money on a regular
basis or have been threatened

the police would check my criminal records for any serious crimes andor
records of serious mental diseases

       this has been suggested in the yous and generally supported among
gun owners  what many object to is that many if not most proposals
contain a sort of gotcha clause which allows an arbitrary denial even
if you qualify in every way

now if a got my licence i would have to be an active member of the gun
club for six months before i could collect my gun
it is a little like getting a drivers licence is not it 
you have to prove that you can drive before you are allowed to

       at this point it should be pointed out that in general
a drivers licence in the yous is for the most part nothing like its
european counterpart  i understand getting one is far more difficult
there than here  in the yous it is a joke 

       but my usual objection is that you are discussing two different
things  for instance in the yous a drivers license is a permit
to operate a motor vehicle on a public road  it is not necessary
to own one or to operate it on private property  that is the
ability to require driving permits is generally considered to arise
from the governments legitimate power to enact reasonable regulations
for behavior on public lands  a permit to own an automobile for instance
which is far closer an analogy would be a much harder thing to get
past legally since it would not be based on making regulations on public
property but in restricting activity on private property              

use of guns in crimes in norway
some crimes are commited with guns that have been in the owners arms
for a long time but these are rather the exeption
most criminals accuire guns to use them in crimes and mostly short 
time befor the crime

use of knives
it is allowed to cary knifes in public but not in your belt or open
you americans think it is ok to have a gun but not to carry it open
in public rigth 

        this varies widely  one thing i think europeans have
a difficult time with is that the yous has fifty unique jurisdictions
where the laws from one state to another can be as radically different
as from one country in europe to another

        some places allow open carry of both guns and knives  some allow
concealed  some prohibit both or allow one or the other  and it can
be either a state or local restriciton       

individual vs masses
yes the individual is more important than the masses but only to some
extent
your criminal laws are to protect the individuals who makes the masses 
what happens when the rigths of some individuals affects the rights of 
all the others 

       the question must be asked  is the right of this individual
affecting the rights of this other individual  what we usually
get is that the rights of this group meaning some individuals within
this group here defined as people who own guns are adversely affecting 
the rights of some other group  

       if for instance bob were using his gun to attack steve you would
have a point  but essentially what we are discussing is that becuase
some person who qualifies as a member of the group people who own
guns then some third person perhaps in another time zone is told
that their being a member of that group is taking away somebody elses
rights  it is like trying to punish all newspapers for the libel commited
by one

the issue
i believe the issue is guns and gunlegislation

       the issue is crime violence and murder  the question is to
what extent guns and gun legislation impact those

we should not mix weapons and items that can serve as one
if i lived in amerika i would probably have a gun to defend myselfe in home
but should it have to be like that 

       of course not  it would be nice if we did not have to fear that
other people might get it into their twisted little minds to hurt us
but currently we do not have that option  nor do i expect we will

do you think it is wise to sell guns like candy some states do 

       no state does  in any case there is a limit to which the state
may enforce it is wisdom on me  freedom in general is an unwise
concept  if you preemptively restrict everything which might be
unwise then freedom becomes a meaningless concept
   
if you believe it is smartneccacery to have driverslicence why do you think
it should be free to buy guns 

       i will raise my hand against drivers licenses  as currently
implemented they are a waste of time and little more than revanue
generation for the state and ignored by a startling number of
drivers  it does not guarantee a level of skill any higher than is
necessary to get your car on the road and get yourself or somebody
else killed or a knowledge of traffic laws beyond what any ten year
old will have picked up riding around in his parents car

       but as i mentioned they are two different things

i would be concerned about how the car was driven and how well it was
maintained  i own a turbocharged one and i would never buy a
turbocharged vehicle unless i knew the owner and hisher
drivingmaintenance habits

question is that the ninetyone tsi awd was mentioned in the
april consumer reports to a car to avoid

i have been wondering about that myself  the ninety awd models and the
ninetyones were identical except for the abs option  

in particular the manual transmission

yes  some owners had problems with the transaxles  using
synthetic lubricants in the transaxles solved the problem in most
cases  the problem was not unique to the awds however  it was
common to all models  the galant vrfour and gsx had the same transaxle
but i did not see those listed in cr

electrical system

i do not know of any major complaints in this area except that the
battery that was installed at the factory had a low current rating 

and brakes were below par in both models

the first fwd models those built before may one thousand nine hundred and eightynine were recalled for
brake upgrades  some fwd and awd owners had problems with warped
rotors  those of us who insist on using manual torque wrenches every
time the lug nuts are tightened have never had a problem

a friend of mine
ownes a ninety tsi awd and he has had two brake jobs pads

i can refer you to someone who has gone through a set of pads in one
day  it all depends on how you drive  it seems that most owners have
been getting between fortyseventyk on a set of pads

one stuck valve

first time i hear about a problem with the valve train on these cars
other than timing belt failures

and some clutchtransmission problem something
about stickinggrinding into second gear  this does not seem
too bad if one beats on his car

if your friend beats on the car then his unit is not a
representative sample of the cars reliability

my suggestion is instead of listening to the useless consumer reports
talk to several owners the mailing list may be the best way to reach
a few of them

i am willing to suffer reliabilityfor speed and looks  seems
you have to pay big buck if you want all three  anyway can

imho it does not really matter who started any individual battle within
the arabsisreal war context the real question is whowhat  started the
war does anyone have any doubts it was the creation of israel on arab
land 

       huh  a war was started when several armies invaded israel
vowing to drive the jews into the sea  most jews wanted to live in
peace and the arabs who stayed in israel were granted citizenship

it depends entirely on how you define war the actual fighting largely
predates the arab invasions  after all deir yassin happened in midapril
well before the arab invasion as i have said elsewhere lt col lorch has
said that hagana forces were fighting well before the arabs invaded as in
months before as for jews wanting to live in peace that to is entirely
arguable i think it is easy enough to show that the labour party leadership
had no such intention at all as for the arabs who stayed do not you mean
those who were not expelled even some of those who did stay were not
granted citizenship but expelled after the fighting had stopped anyway

joseph askew


how do you define war  do seiges and constant attacks on villiages
count as acts of war or is that only when the jews do them
january one thousand nine hundred and fortyeight arab liberation army attacks kfar szold
               one thousand men attack kfar etzion fourteen miles south of jerusalem
                    after cutting off the supply lines to it
attacks on yehiam western galilee and kibbutz tirat tzvi
by midmarch the jewish settlements in the negev had been cut off from
      land links with the rest of the jewish population
         the etzion group of villiages near hebron had been cut off
            while fortytwo members of a convoy trying to supply yehiam were
            slaughtered cutting off the villiage
jerusalem was under seige being cut off from its supply route from
     tel aviv the bombed out supply trucks have been left on the side
     of that road to this day in memoriam  by this time one thousand two hundred jews 
     had been killed

of course this is not war since it is only the arabs attacking
just like last week when the fatah launched katyusha rockets
against northern israel  where does uprising end and war begin

i use desqviewx and i think it is great where it really shines imho is
to let unix users log into a pc and run dos and windows applications with
the display going to their screens
you will need to get
desqviewx v oneone
desqviewx v oneone                           two hundred and seventyfive suggested retail
desqviewx to other x systems v oneone        two hundred suggested retail

you also must be running a supported network ftp softwares pctcp
novell lan workplace for dos sun microsystems pcnfs beame and whiteside
wollongong pathway tcpip or hp microsoft lan manager

if you do not have any of this network stuff quarterdeck will give you a
copy of novell tcpip transprot for dos with the network manager

you can get more info by sending email to appropriately infoqdeckcom

actually infoqdeckcom is our customer service department if you have
technical questions you can write to supportqdeckcom

in my opinion if you want to have other people logging in and running
applications at your pc you will want to have a four hundred and eightysix thirtythree with sixteen megs of ram
also the xwindows software in desqviewx really seems to like an et four thousand
tseng labs chipset based graphics card personally i found that things
ran better with a scsi drive in the pc than with esdi drives but that is
my experience only

what sort of traffic is generated with the xcalls  i am curious to find
out the required bandwidth that a link must have  if one machine running
dvx is supporting multiple users clients and we require adequate response
time  anyone have any ideas   

i expect the limiting factor will be your server machine not the network
itself to give you a realworld example here at quarterdeck we have
roughly one hundred people using dvx to talk to a bunch of unix boxes novell
file servers and each other it is not too much of a load on our
ethernet with maybe four concentrators so you have twentythirty people on each
segment if you had a badly loaded net or the apps you wanted to run
were very network intensive you could run into some slowdowns

but the biggest problem would be the machine itself say you have a four hundred and eightysix
thirtythree with plenty of ram and a fast hard disk and network card if you have
ten people running programs off it you are going to see some slowdowns
because you are now on effectively a threethree mhz four hundred and eightysix of course dvx will
attempt to see if tasks are idle and make sure they give up their time
slice but if you have ten working programs running you will know it

having said that if you can tweak the programs being run by adding
in calls to give up time slices when idle and that sort of
thing you could probably run fifteentwenty people on a given machine before
you started seeing slowdowns again this time from network bandwidth
it all really depends on what the programs are doing ie you are going
to see a slowdown from xbandwidth a lot sooner if your apps are all
doing network things also

the idea of the card is bull in and of its self but i am curious to know do 
they plan on making it a requirement to always have it on you or is it 
only going to be required to be presented when trying to ge medical aid

this at least has already been determined the blue cross medical
coverage for all federal employees is a good model for a future
national system to get emergency medical care anyone so insured
must always carry their blue cross card before entering a hospital
you must notify blue cross or they will refuse to pay your bills 
in an emergency where you must be treated before notifying them 
you must inform them within twentyfour hours or if you are unable to do
so for medical reasons the hospital must failing to do so within
twentyfour hours means they will not cover the hospitalization in you need
your card to notify them and without the card the hospital certainly
would not know they had to therefore you are required to carry
the card at all times or do without emergency medical coverage

hi all

i really thought that by now i would have seen something
about this but i have not so here goes  last night on
the evening news the anchorperson said something to the
effect that one of the ssrbs that was recovered after the
recent space shuttle launch was found to have a wrench of
some sort rattling around apparently inside the case  there
was no elaboration as to where specfically the item was
found of what type of wrench it was but the anchorperson
did say something about a nasa official commenting that
there would be an inquiry into how the thing got in the ssrb

has anybody else on the net whose info sources may be 
better than mine heard anything about this  it seems rather

plus questions for you  why do subjectivistsrelativistsnihilists get so 
het up about the idea that relativism is better than objectivism 

to the degree that relativism is a more accurate decription of the
truth than is objectivism it provides more power and ability to
control events

assuming for the moment that morals are relative then two
relativists can recognize that neither has a lock on the absolute
truth and they can proceed to negotiate a workable compromise that
produces the desired results

assuming that there is an absolute morality two disagreeing 
objectivists can either be both wrong or just one of them right there
is no room for compromise  once you beleive in absolute morals
you must accept that you are amoral or that everyone who disagrees
with you is amoral

given a choice between a peaceful compromise or endless contention
i would say that compromise seems to be better

the point being that what people say and what they acutally do
may be different

it is interesting that this clip from the newspaper did not

i would say that one innocent person killed is in some sense
as bad as many   we certainly feel that way when we punish
someone for a single murder
now if we reform system x by reducing the number of deaths
by one we produce system xx    i would say we should not go back
to system x even though by doing so we would reintroduce only 
a single extra death

bob seems to think that one is as bad as many in a sense somewhat stronger than
the one you indicate


  yes i do  

  my argument is that the sole purpose of the death penalty is to
  kill people  that is it is primary and i would argue only
  purpose  to continue to kill people by a practice that has
  almost no utility especially when you know you will be killing
  innocents is unconscionable

  at the very least the existence of the prison system and our
  transportation system are based on their merits to society not
  their detriments  we are willing to accept a few lost innocent
  lives because there is an overwhelming benefit to the continued
  existence of these systems  one has to stretch the evidence and
  the arguments to make the same claim for capital punishment

  just in case i was not clear again  we maintain a capital
  punsihment system that kills innocent people and provides us with
  no net positive gain  why

  were you to pin me in a corner and ask i would have to respond
  that i do not belief the state should have the right to take life
  at all  but i will not open that debate as it seems others are
  tiring of this thread on aa anyway

subject lezgians astir in azerbaijan and daghestan
summary asking not to fight against armenians in karabakh  for unification
organization sdpa center for regional studies
lines one hundred and six


fournineteenone thousand nine hundred and ninetythree zero  lezghis astir

by nejla sammakia
 associated press writer
   
gussar azerbaijan ap  the six hundredzero lezghis of azerbaijan and russia have
begun clamoring for their own state threatening turmoil in a tranquil corner 
of the caucasus

the region has escaped the ethnic warfare of neighboring nagornokarabakh
abkhazia and ossetia but lezhgis could become the next minority in the former
soviet union to fight for independence

lezghis who are muslim descendents of nomadic shepherds are angry about the
conscription of their young men to fight in azerbaijans fiveyearold undeclared
war with armenia

they also want to unite the lezghi regions of azerbaijan and russia which
were effectively one until the breakup of the soviet union created national
borders that had been only lines on a map

a rally of more than threezero lezghis in march to protest conscription and
demand a separate lezghistan alarmed the azerbaijani government

officials in baku the capital deny rumors that police shot six
demonstrators to death but the government announced strict security measures
and began cooperating with russian authorities to control the movement of
lezhgis living across the border in the dagestan region of russia

visitors to gussar the center of lezhgi life found the town quiet soon
after the protest children played outdoors in the crisp mountain air

at the sunday bazaar men in heavy coats and dark fur hats gathered to
discuss grievances ranging from high customs duties at the russian border to a
war they say is not theirs

i have been drafted but i will not go said shamil kadimov gold teeth
glinting in the sun why must i fight a war for the azerbaijanis i have
nothing to do with armenia

more than threezero people have died in the war which centers on the disputed
territory of nagornokarabakh about one hundred and fifty miles to the southeast

malik kerimov an official in the mayors office said only eleven of three hundred locals
drafted in one thousand nine hundred and ninetytwo had served

the police do not force people to go he said they are afraid of an
uprising that could be backed by lezghis in dagestan

all the men agreed that police had not fired at the demonstrators but
disagreed on how the protest came about

some said it occurred spontaneously when rumors spread that azerbaijan was
about to draft onefive hundred men from the gussar region where seventyfivezero lezghis live

others said the rally was ordered by gen muhieddin kahramanov leader of the
lezhgi underground separatist movement sadval based in dagestan

we organized the demonstration when families came to us distraught about
draft orders said kerim babayev a mathematics teacher who belongs to sadval

we hope to reunite peacefully by approaching everyone  the azerbaijanis 
the russians

in the early eighteenth century the lezhgis formed two khanates or sovereignties
in what are now azerbaijan and dagestan they roamed freely with their sheep
over the green hills and mountains between the two khanates

by one thousand eight hundred and twelve the lezghi areas were joined to czarist russia after one thousand nine hundred and seventeen they
came under soviet rule with the disintegration of the soviet union the 
six hundredzero lezghis were faced for the first time with strict borders

about half remained in dagestan and half in newly independent azerbaijan

we have to pay customs on all this on cars on wine complained mais
talibov a small trader his goods laid out on the ground at the bazaar
included brandy stomach medication and plastic shoes from dagestan

we want our own country he said we want to be able to move about easily
but baku will not listen to us

physically it is hard for outsiders to distinguish lezhgis from other
azerbaijanis in many villages they live side by side working at the same 
jobs and intermarrying to some degree

but the lezhgis have a distinctive language a mixture of arabic turkish and
persian with strong guttural vowels

azerbaijan officially supports the cultural preservation of its ten largest
ethnic minorities the lezghis have weekly newspapers and some elementary 
school classes in their language

autonomy is a different question if the lezghis succeeded in separating from
azerbaijan they would set a precedent for other minorities such as the 
talish in the south the tats in the nearby mountains and the avars of eastern
azerbaijan

why anyone would order an sho with an automatic transmission is
beyond me if you cannot handle a stick you should stick with a

say that there are not real drivers who cannot use the stick eg
disabled persons but they are not in any position to use an
sho anyway 

i would be willing to bet that if we removed the automatic
transmissions from all performancetype cars like the fivezerol
mustangs camaros and the like we would cut down on the number of
accidents each year autos are fine for sedate little sedans
but they have no business in performance cars imho

i have to disagree with this  i have a ninetytwo ztwentyeight with a three hundred and fifty and a fourspeed auto
w overdrive and it is really better that way  chevy autos are reknowned
for their long life and ability to handle copious amount of power  i live 
in the dallas area and a manual would be much harder to drive in the traffic 
here  now if i still lived out in the sticks like i used to a manual would be
more fun  

safetywise an auto is less distractingi would hate to have to be    
shifting gears while i was trying to ease into traffic in the freeways here
performancewise i can hold my own against any stock fivezero mustang or fivezero
camaro w a five speed  

all of this imho 

all of my hos disagree with your hos  i loved dallas rush hour in my stick
detested it in the autolike i did any other time in the auto  of course
dalls rush hours are nothing from what i hearif i lived in la i might
be of a different persuasion  and just for the record rarely do you shift
gears when merging into trafficthat is what five speeds are good forfourth is
good up through around eightyninety most of the time so you can just wind it out
it is not going to hurt anything and keeps it in the powerband anyway
only shift into top gear when you are exceeding redline in fourthfairly rare
unless you drive a ferrari or some such i would bet or when you hit cruising

 top ten signs that it is the age of aquarius on pennsylvania avenue



ten men in uniform are persona non grata in the home of our commander in
    chief

nine  algores enviromentalism will make the clean air act look like an
    industrial policy

eight  higher taxes are once again the prescription for all that ails america

seven  tax dodging is unpatriotic draft dodging is a symbol of pride

six  beaded curtains hang from the oval office windows

five  socialism may be dead in the exsoviet union but we are told to prepare
    for the nationalization of our health care resources these people
    must be inhaling something

four  not quite free love but eating flowers is considered healthy

three  the feminazis have a president in the white house whether the rest of
    us realize it or not

two  slick may be the first draft dodger to send american troops into
    combat

one  slick may be unpopular with middleclass americans but he is a big hit
    on campus with the professorial class



copyright c edward a ipser jr one thousand nine hundred and ninetythree


here is my own top ten response to mr ipsers list


ten  it is about time we have a president that might actually stand up to the
     military  our men and women in uniform must learn that the world does not
     revolve around them and that one of the things they are out there defending
     is our right to be critical of them even denounce them

nine   let me explain something to you  environmental policy and industrial
     policy must go hand in hand  our nation and indeed our planet cannot
     afford to continue ignoring this as was done over the last twelve years
     our industrialenvironmental position has been downright shameful we
     must have active government support of the key industries such as
     telecommunications microelectronics medical biotech and environmental
     tech  meanwhile weed out old inneficient highpolution industries
     that are better left to other nations  this will make us richer help
     produce new jobs and help the environment  to give credit where credit
     is due i heard a lot of this in a speech by senator john kerry dma
     tonite  in addition it is time we get really really serious about 
     issues like overpopulation globabl warming and ozone depletion  the
     planet on which we live should be our utmost priority

eight   it just so happens that that it takes money to make this country work
     to provide the services that people need and to help solve the problems
     that need to be solved  granted some things can probably be done more
     efficiently for less money and should be  but some things are going to
     cost more money and i am sick and tired of hearing everyone whining about
     taxes all the time  you want to live in my country you pay your fair
     share

seven   i cannot believe what hypocrites people are when they ask people to give
     up their lives for their country and then complain about taxes  if you are
     willing to send me off to die for some stupid obsession with fighting an
     enemy which at best does not affect us and at worst really should be our
     friend then you have no right to tell me you should not pay taxes

six   hey i think the beaded curtains add a lovely sixtysesque touch

five   look canada europe and japan manage to provide health care for their
     citizens and yes basic health is a human right which people are
     entitled to  if these nations are not capitalist enough for you then
     i guess we have found something better than capitalism  there is nothing
     sacred about the capitalist system and if something be it socialism
     or anything else works better then i say let capitalism die

four   make love not war

three   contrary to popular belief it is possible to be a male and a feminist
     at the same time  to discriminate against or to deny equal opportunity
     to a majority of the population is just plain wrong and trying to force
     them into some sort of tradition role is even worse  women certainly 
     have as much to offer this world as men and the day that gender
     discrimination is finally broken it going to make all the revolutions of
     the past few centuries seem like reform bills  i look forward to it

two   see number ten

 now  you can try to tell me that it was not scientific enough and
 that i have not proven beyond the shadow of a doubt that i have a

 know that i do not wish to get sick from eating food thank you very
 much  
 
if you could not tell which one had message why restaurants bother to
use it at all 

if you can taste the difference psychological reaction might play a role

the fact is message is part of natural substance everyone i mean everyone
consumes certain amount of message every day through regular diet without
the synthesized message additive

chinese and many other asians japanese koreans etc have used
message as flavor enhancer for two thousand years do you believe that
they knew how to make message from chemical processes not they just
extracted it from natural food such sea food and meat broth

how can i
 get round the problem

does the workstation you are using have hardware cursor support  or does
the server generate a software cursor  you can generally tell the difference
just by using it  if the cursor blinks a lot when there is screen activity
it is probably a software cursor  if it has a hardware cursor i think you are
probably battling a bug in hps x server  i am not familiar with any hardware
cursor chips that display cursors greater than sixtyfourxsixtyfour  it is quite possible
that the server is just echoing your preferred cursor size without actually
checking it  i vaguely recall that very old mit server revisions did just 
that

in reality you are probably stuck with a sixtyfourxsixtyfour maximum size cursor regardless
of what the server returns

getting back to the original question in this thread

i experienced breathing difficulties a few years ago similar to those
described  in my case it turned out that i was developing type i
diabetes  although i never sought direct confirmation of this from my
doctor i think that the breathing problem was associated with the
presence of ketones due to the diabetes

i think that ketosis can occur in lesser degree if one is restricting
their food intake drastically  i do not know if this relevant in this
case but you might ask your daughter if she has been eating
properly

did anyone notice the words not for baseball printed on the picture
of joe robbie stadium in the opening day season preview section in usa
today any reason given for this

also i just noticed something looking at the nolan ryan timeline in
the preview on eighttwentytwoeightynine rickey henderson became nolans five thousandth strikeout
on sixelevenninety he pitched his sixth nohitter against oakland i believe the
last out in the game was made by rickey henderson and on fiveoneninetyone nolan
pitched his seventh nohitter on the same day a certain someone stole his
nine hundred and thirtynineth base which overshadowed it it seems that nolan is having a lot of
publicity at rickeys expense i am going to rickey deserves it and it seems as
most of the net agrees with me from what i have seen on it lately they are
both great players but i am going to nolan has outclassed rickey both in playing
and more importantly in attitude just my thoughts

i currently have novell netware lite which does not work with

i am considering moving all our machines to wfourwg

qone  how much conventional ram does wfourwg use over and above the
     driver for the network card

qtwo  if i have a novell netwo thousand card are the lsl and ipx drivers
     still needed

qthree  does wfourwg do a license check over the network to ensure each
     machine is running its own licenced copy of wfourwg note i do
     not want to break the license agreement and i will buy a copy
     of wfourwg for each of our machines it is just that i would like
     to try it out first to see if it meets our needs returning one
     opened copy is much easier than returning n opened copies

qfour  if you buy the upgrade to windows threeone for wfourwg does it replace

i have an sethirty with a eighty meg hd which dates back to april one thousand nine hundred and eightynine  when i
originally purchased it i experienced the failure to boot problem  this
was fixed soon after by a rom upgrade on the hard drive

lately a similar problem has been occuring  when the computer is
powered on the hd light flashes a few times and then i am given
the no disk to boot from icon  however upon turing the
computer off and on again the drive always boots up just fine  
furthermore if instead of turning the power on and off i press the reboot 
button the same problem occurs  but as i said turning the power
off and on always works

this problem is different from the one thousand nine hundred and eightynine boot problem in that before
it often required several power off and ons to get it to boot

does anybody have any suggestions as to what the problem is or how
it can be fixed

i am wondering if it is getting old and requires more time to 
come up to speed now  is there a pram or scsi setting that
allows me to tell the computer to wait a little longer before 
trying to access the hd

i have seen were eight hundred and eighty and nine hundred and fifty but i have also heard of eight hundred and ninety and nine hundred and forty
i am not sure that the ten nm one way or another will make a great deal of

	another suggestion  find a brand of tv that uses an ir remote

that have been pinched in the middle does anybody know what the
actual purpose of those things are i hear that they are called
cooling towers but what the heck do they cool
i hope someone can help 


the actual hourglass is hollow and is designed to generate a draft
exploiting the venturi effect  around the base of the hourglass is a
ring of water towers  warm river water coming from the steam condenser
in the plant is sprayed over louvres  the draft being pulled through
the tower cools the water by both evaporation and convection  the
sensible heat extracted from the cooling water is the driving force for
draft generation

it should be noted that the hourglassshaped cooling towers are used on
both fossile and nuclear plants  it should also be noted that at 
locations where water is plentiful the cooling towers are only used part
time when the discharge temperature would exceed some release limit
it was once thought that the warm discharge water was damaging to fish
fishermen know that is thoroughly incorrect  nontheless stringent
usually state regulations remain in some instances  since it typically
takes sixtyzero hp worth of pumping to move the volume of water needed 
to cool a one thousand mwe plant the cost of using the towers is not insignificant

we are just completing a project on nebuliser performance and have a
wealth of data on particle size and output which we are going to use
to adjudicate a contract next week

although the output data is easy for us to present there seems to be
little concensus on the optimum diameter of the nebulised droplets for
straightforward inhalation therapy eg for asthmatics

some say that the droplets must be smaller than five microns whilst
others say that if they are too small they will not be effective

articleid indyvaxone thousand nine hundred and ninetythreeaprtwentytwoone hundred and sixtytwo thousand five hundred and oneseven hundred and fortyseven
lines ten

in my first posting on this subject i threw out an idea of how to fund
such a contest without delving to deep into the budget  i mentioned
granting mineral rights to the winner my actual wording was mining
rights  somebody pointed out quite correctly that such rights are
not anybodys to grant although i imagine it would be a fait accompli
situation for the winner  so how about this  give the winning group
i cannot see one company or corp doing it a ten twenty or fifty year
moratorium on taxes

organization simon fraser university burnaby bc canada
lines forty

ecktonsucsbyuedu sean eckton writes

i have a microsoft serial mouse and am using mousecom eightzero was using eighttwenty 
i think but switched to eightzero to see if it was any better  vertical motion 
is nice and smooth but horizontal motion is so bad i sometimes cannot click 
on something because my mouse jumps around  i can be moving the mouse to 
the right with relatively uniform motion and the mouse will move smoothly 
for a bit then jump to the right then move smoothly for a bit then jump 
again maybe this time to the left about five inch  this is crazy  i have 
never had so much trouble with a mouse before  anyone have any solutions  

try this  flip your mouse over and open up the cover that holds the
mouse ball in place  remove the ball and inside you should see
probably three rollers  if any of the rollers have a tiny layer of
cakedon dirt dust or otherwise unidentifiable scum on them carefully
scrape it off with a small knife xacto works great  be careful
you do not want to gauge the rollers just clean off the dirt
put the ball back in put the cover on and there you are  

i clean a couple of dozen of these every month here  another symptom
is that when you move the mouse it seems to click along  if this
does not solve your problem at least you have a clean mouse  i highly
recommend using a proper soft mouse pad and if you are a clean freak
place it in your drawer every night or when you do not use it to keep
the dust off

personally i prefer track balls  oh which brings me to another point
if your mouse or trackball tracks optically and the sunlight is 
streaming through the window onto your mousetrackball you may notice
that it will stop working  if this happens to you close the curtains
or blinds or simply shade your pointing device and see if that helps

i would like to take the liberty to quote from a christian writer named 
ellen g white  i hope that what she said will help you to edit your 
remarks in this group in the future

do not set yourself as a standard  do not make your opinions your views 
of duty your interpretations of scripture a criterion for others and in 
your heart condemn them if they do not come up to your ideal
                         thoughts fromthe mount of blessing p one hundred and twentyfour

i hope quoting this does not make the atheists gag but i think ellen white 
put it better than i could

bobby mozumder

my point is that you set up your views as the only way to believe  saying 
that all eveil in this world is caused by atheism is ridiculous and 
counterproductive to dialogue in this newsgroups  i see in your posts a 
spirit of condemnation of the atheists in this newsgroup bacause they don
t believe exactly as you do  if you are here to try to convert the atheists 
here you are failing miserably  who wants to be in position of constantly 
defending themselves agaist insulting attacks like you seem to like to do
i am sorry you are so blind that you did not get the messgae in the quote 
everyone else has seemed to

many people would probably think especially if the fanatics propogandized
this that this was a conflict between the atheists and the religious
many would get the impression that we were trying to outlaw religion if
we contintue to try to remove all things with a religious reference
that is not what the people i have asked think perhaps you would be right
if you said the fundamentalists would think this way after all they think
they are being oppressed when they are not allowed to oppress however
you have not shown where you get this idea that many people would
probably think it is atheism vs religion winner take all as far as i can
tell it is your groundless prediction that this will happen

but you have not taken into the account of propoganda  remember if you
asked germans before wwii if the jews shoudl be slaughtered they would
probably answer no but after the propoganda machine rolled through at
least some were able to tolerate it

you see it only takes a small group of fanatics to whip up a general
frenzy

the propoganda machines have been in gear over a number of issues including
abortion and gays  look at some of the things that have happened
well so far they have passed one amendment which is currently under
intense scrutiny and they have failed to outlaw abortion which is their
prime goal on that issue yep they seem sooo effective sure

well they have not managed to outlaw abortion due to the possible objectivity
of the courts  but they have managed to create quite a few problems for
people that wanted to have an abortion  they could create similar problems
for us  and it could be worse  they can try to stop abortions by blocking
clinics etc but imagine what they would have to do to stop atheism

besides the margin of error is very large when you only talk to two people
better than your one that is your opinion also i have branched
out and the informal survey is up over half a dozen now
and what have they said  were you questions unbiased
keith you would claim that my questions are biased the minute i posted
them because the answers agreed with me everyone i have asked about
the possible removal of the motto the christian portion has expressed
regret about its loss because they like it however when it is pointed
out to them that a new motto will not be in the works none have expressed
the desire to rape murder pillage etc which you have basically claimed

so you are able to convince them individually but could you convince a
whole room of them  a whole nation

as for the atheist portion i know some around here they have all
expressed disgust with the motto some noted being harassed by christians
who used the motto to try to seem justified and all would see it gone

yes i would be glad if it were gone to  i have never supported it  however
i think that it is a minor problem that can be easily ignored contrasted
with what could happen an what may be likely

which christians designed the motto  does the motto say anything about
jesus  why do you think that it refers only to christians
christians wrote it christians think that their religion is right and
all others are wrong therefore why would they include other religions
in the realm of being correct i doubt that any other religions were meant
to be included

well i am not clear on the religious convictions of francis scott key the
motto can be attributed to him but it is at least clear that he believed
in a god  and surely there are a few christians that think as you say
but i do not think that most do  do you think that all christians actively
despise other religions  most that i have met have not and do not do so

no christian
that i have queried thinks it means anything but them and only them
why not ask some people of other faiths
sorry i would but christianity is just so awfully popular around here
suppose you could ask a few people

well i have asked a hindu moselem and a few jews and all of them think
that it is applicable to them  of course i cannot say that these people
just some that i know pretty well are accurate representations of their
faiths

it is always a good idea to assume that there were dissenting views on any
given issue  you are assuming that all the views were the same and nothing
leads to this conclusion
without evidence to the contrary i doubt that there were dissenting
opinions you claim there were provide some evidence for your assertion

well i would really like to and i have tried but i really do not know where to
get access to congressional records from the one thousand nine hundred and fiftys  can anyone help
out here

comparing christians to nazis interesting

only in the sense that neither can probably convinced to change their beliefs

no again the motto on the money does not cost you anything extra  however
if you abolished the motto we would all have to pay to have all the dies and
plates redone
like people paid before to get them changed to have the motto on them
you now need to show that there is a good reason to change everything again

 also i doubt that they use ththree
same plates for more than a years printing this would make it easy
to remove the motto simply make next years plates without it your
claim evidently is that they will have to pay extra somewhere
provide some evidence for this assertion

so are you saying that they redesign the plates each year

anyway your whole argument conveniently deleted i see was that the motto
somehow costs us all a lot of money  this is just not correct

the ones i read did not mention anything about jesus  i think the issue was
concerning the distinction between religion and not
how could it be between religious and not religious the motto
refers to god it is a religious motto the question is whether or
not it is only christian you say it is more i doubt this provide
some evidence for this assertion

that is to say the religion of this country and the nonreligion of
the ussr  that was what most of those quotes were about and some included
all atheists in general as well  i do not think that any of the quotes
although i seem to have lost them mentioned anything at all about jesus
they advocated religion over nonreligion  a specific religion was not
mentioned

you have missed this point  i said that the motto did not say anything
about anyone in particular  that is the motto does not imply anything
about your particular beliefs  it does not say that everyone trusts
in some form of god only that the nation on the whole does
we have been through this before it is obvious it does not include me
this much is beyond doubt your claim again is that the motto refers
to more than christians based on the facts that christianity says all
other religions are wrong and because it seems that the motto was
written by christians i doubt your claim

so you are saying that all christians must believe that all other religions
should be outlawed just because they think they are wrong  that is silly
i think the flatearthers are wrong but i do not advocate their banishment

  based on this idea i doubt that any additional expense would
even be incurred by removing the motto provide some evidence for your
claim that it would

i think that any such cost would be insignificant  i mentioned the slight
cost because you said that the motto was costing us a lot of money by
being on our currency

disregarding the digression of the other mottoif it is used for
harassment and no other purpose has been found for it why should
it not be removed

well mottos in general do not really have purposes  i do not think it
should be removed because i think the benefit would be outweighed by the
consequences

and do you know what the vote was  were there other opinions  do you
think that the main reason the motto was required by law was to bother
atheists  do you think that this is what the majority of congress at
the time had in mind  if you do then show why
again it is the opinion of the people who put it there that i am
concerned with

then you should be concerned with the opinion of the entire congress

again it is not necessary that the complete majority
shared the purpose of confronting godless communism with this motto

why not  it is the majority that put it there

the general public probably does not know about the antiatheist intent
of a few people in the fiftys either
i daresay more people remember the fiftys than the time when key wrote
the anthem

but do they remember the debate surrounding the motto  do they remember
that some people intended it to be a message against atheists  why do not
you include this in your little survey that you were conducting


you claim here that scientists would believe someone is claims i doubt
this provide evidence for your assertion

what  should i ask some scientists the probability that something einstein
said about relativity is worthy  i mean if einstein said it there is a
good chance that it was right at least at the time

as for the courts the
method scientists use can be applied i need not agree with the court
by default because of a good record

you need not agree with them all of the time but you would certainly think
that their decisions would be good evidence in favor of some point

what  but you said you did not agree with the court because they allowed
congress to attempt to make an amendment prohibiting flag burning  if
you do not realize that something like this is external to the realm of
the courts power then how can i be confident that you know anything
about the courts powers  i mean if you do not know how the court works
how can you participate in a discussion of the court
a judge can go to speak before congress and still you ignore the
abortion gag rule as you make your claims on abortion

no i think that it would be clearly inappropriate for a supreme court
justice to testify before congress during the consideration of a
constitutional amendment

and in order for the court to rule on something a case usually must be
presented

mushrooms flowers trees buildings signs whatever  the analogy is
the same  just because something that i might find offensive is present
does not mean that my rights are being violated
we are talking about something put there by people keithnot
a mushroom no one caused that mushroom to exist unless you are
finding things offensive in a mushroom farm

yes some mushrooms can be planted  and i do not appreciate mushrooms on
my pizza either

this is not the case
with the motto and you are ignoring the harassment which is the
only known result of the motto and you are ignoring that somewhere
along the line people were forced to put the motto there

who was forced to put the motto there  what do you mean

you will probably need to do something specific which will vary
depending upon your news software  clh

at any rate i need some support  much thanks to jayne k who is
already supporting me with kind words and prayers

i have been working at this company for eight years in various
engineering jobs  i am female  yesterday i counted and realized that
on seven different occasions i have been sexually harrassed at this
company  seven times eight years yesterday was the most recent one
someone left an xrated photo of a nude woman in my desk drawer

i am really upset by this  i suppose it could have been worse  it
could have been a man having sex with a sheep or something

there was no note  i do not know if it was

	 someone is idea of an innocent joke that went awry
	 someone is sick idea of flirting
	 an act of emotional terrorism that worked

i dreaded coming back to work today  what if my boss comes in to ask
me some kind of question i do not know the answer so i take a military
specification down off from my shelf to look up the answer and out
falls a picture of a man having sex with a sheep  i generally have a
bible on my desk for occasional inspiration what if i open it up to
corinthians and find a picture a la the north american man boy love
association  i want to throw up just thinking about this stuff

i can lock up my desk but i cannot lock up every book i have in the
office  i cannot trust that someone will not shove something into my
briefcase or my coat pocket when i am not looking so that i go home to
find such a picture or a threat or a raunchy note about what someone
wants to do to my body

to make it worse the entire department went out to lunch yesterday to
treat our marvelous secretary to lunch  the appointed hour for
leaving was eleventhirty  i was working in another building but wanted to go
to the lunch  so i returned at eleventwentyfive only to find that ever single
person had already left for lunch  they left at elevenfifteen or so  no one
could be bothered to call me at the other building even though my
number was posted  so i came back to a department that looked like a
neutron bomb had gone off and i was the sole survivor  this despite
the fact that everyone knew how bad i felt about this naked woman being
left in my desk drawer

i need some prayers  i cannot stop crying i am so deeply wounded
that it is ridiculous

i feel like i am some kind of subhuman piece of garbage for people to
reduce me and my sisters to simply sex organs and the sex act  i feel
like i am a subhuman piece of garbage that is not worthy of a simple
phone call saying we are leaving for marys lunch a little early so
that bob can get back for a big onezero meeting

please pray that my resentments will either go away or be miraculously
turned into something positive  please pray that whoever is torturing
me so will stop and find some healing for him or herself please pray
for my being healed from this latest wound which falls on top of a
whole slew of other wounds  please pray that i can find a new job
in a place where the corporate culture does its best to prevent such
harrassment from happening in the first place and swiftly acts
appropriately when something occurs despite its best precautions this
company in my opinion has pretty words about how sexual harrassment
is not tolerated but when you get right down to it how is it that one
female engineer can be touched inappropriately left obsene or
threatening notes left obscene pictures spoken to lewdly etc seven
times in eight years in the same place  pretty words from the company
do me no good when i am terrified or healing from the latest assault

and please pray that i do not turn into an automaton because of this
that is my bad habit ignore it and it will go away you are not worth
anyones time so do not go talking to anyone about this you are right
you are a subhuman piece of garbage and deserve to be treated this
way you are just an object you prostitute your mind to this
company so why cannot others expect you to prostitute your body there as
well what makes you think women are not just possessions and
nothing more than sex organs and their ability to perform the sex act
this is the kind of thinking that can catapault one into a major
depressive episode please pray that these thoughts do not come into
my head and stay there triggering depression

please pray that this latest trauma does not come between me and god
in a way a wound like this is an invitation to a deeper connection to
god and it is also a possible trigger for a spiritual crisis that can
separate one mentally from god  i know god does not drop me from his
loving hand but it is awfully easy for me to walk to the edge of the
hand look down think i am falling and forget that gods still holding
on to me

although this probably is not entirely appropriate for this newsgroup
i really can use the kind of loving support you all provide  for this
reason i hope good mr moderator allows me this latest indulgence  after
all he is allowed me the thermometer note and a few other offthewall
topics

of can tell me there are no clutch hitters maybe no stat can tell me
either but some people are i just know it eight

but why would you want to use rbi   rbi is an attempt to measure is some
combination of clutch hitting and power hitting  if you believe in
clutch hitting then look at how the guy hit with risp  if you want to
see how good of a slugger he is then look at his slugging average  

in terms of evaluating players rbi totals are better than nothing  but
why use them when so many better stats are out there

we have a setup with with thirteen polaroid transducers and rangefinders we
would like to fire these three at a time with about five ms between
firings the three that are being fired do not fire in the same
direction 

to further explain the situation assume we are firing sonars abc
five ms apart each other we should normally see an echo on a that
corresponds to the distance however sonar a detects the init line
of sonar b the detection is actually through the transducer of sonar a
we can see a very faint fiftykhz signal on the transducer exactly at the
time the init line of sonar b is activated 

we feel that there is some ground coupling that is causing this interference
we came to this conclusion since we are using a separate power supply
for sonars b and c

i started a similar thread about a month ago and got many replies
the summary

ctx fourteen nasty low quality avoid

ctx fifteen proscan not as good as some other makes however cheap
  main problem seems poor quality control some reported pincushioning
  the problem i had others poor focus etc etc

i complained about mine and it was  aretuned i dodnt even pay
shipping and returned to me in two days 

it is now clear wellfocussed and has no pincushioning or barrel
distortion at all i am very happy with it and the digital
controls and mode memory are nice certainly a trinitron
say would be much nicer but that is well out of my price range

conclusion if you are on a budget get one and be prepared to
send it back if it is not perfect it probably will not be when you get it
but has good potential

subject re centris six hundred and fifty to decstation enet adapter
organization university of toronto department of industrial engineering
lines eightysix

pnsfonedwsmucsoneumassdedu dennis j wilkinson writes
not necessarily a thridparty adapter apple does manufacture transceivers
for thinwire and tenbaset twisted pair cable media as well as an aui
attachment unit interface transciever they run at one hundred each if you use
thinwire or tenbaset you will probably also need terminators apples
transceivers are selfterminated if i remember correctly but i have no
idea about decs 

the thirdparty media adapters are usually cheaper at least in toronto than
apples i bought the adapters from asante instead of apple

gurmanumbragsfcnasagov joseph b gurman writes
    the decstation five thousand models two hundred and two hundred and forty come with thinwire only
cannot say for certain about the models one hundred and twentyfive and one hundred and thirtythree so your best bet

that is not true only the decstation five thousandtwo hundred comes with a thinwire
bnc coaxial ethernet connector the five thousandtwentyfive five thousandone hundred and thirtythree and five thousandtwo hundred and forty
all have a single fifteenpin aui ethernet connector only i distinctly
remembered this because when got the five thousandtwo hundred first and i thought all
of them are going to be thinwire i eventually had to go back and ordered
destas decs oversized version of an auitobnc adapter that must be used
with a transciever cable for the rest of the stations

my advise to the very original poster beverly is

one if all you want is to create a lan with two workstations and will not add
    machines to it ever go for thinwire regardless of the media type going
    for utp unshielded twisted pair wiring requires a concentrator which
    means extra money and i believe these units come with at least six ports
    as for thicknet it is a nightmare and cabling is expensive avoid it
    unless you have no choice eg the two machines are two floors parts

two on the mac side you will need
     one thinwire media adapter from apple or thirdparty
     macx make sure you get version onetwo oneoneseven will not run on system sevenone
     mactcp which comes with macx if you get macx vonetwo you should be
      getting mactcp voneoneone with it do not use earlier versions on a centris
     you may or may not need a twentyfiveohm terminator depending on the
      thinwire media adapter so just ask the sales if the adapter is
      selfterminated or not
     configure mactcp to use ethernet

three on the decstation side you will need
     for a model two hundred you will only need a tconnector
     for models twentyfive one hundred and twentyfive one hundred and thirtythree two hundred and forty you will need an auitobnc adapter
      get one that can be plugged in directly to the aui port of the
      decstation this way you save the cost of a transciever cable
      a fifteenpin aui male to a fifteenpin aui female cable
     get a twentyfiveohm terminator

your twomachine network will look like this

  as an economist i am sure you can see the flaws in this logic if the naive
market is flooded with proprietary but weak encryption then truly strong 
encryption will be unable to compete

this is true for the mass market but not for those who need strong crypto
and are willing to pay the price after all one can buy strong crypto today
if one is willing to spend enough

thus the concern is not economic

the issue most worth worrying about is that after the system takes hold the
government will outlaw other systems and something voluntary will become
the only system available that is a political not an economic issue

as a separate matter you may be making an implied advocacy for cheap secure
crypto for everyone it is true that the clipper chip would probably prevent
that except via clipper but cheap secure crypto for everyone is a
political discussion not an economic one and the whole point of clipper is 
to resolve that political policy tension between securing legitimate
communications and tapping the crooks

   at the company i worked for previously i received a file that was
   des encryped and the person that had sent it went on vaction
   rather than wait two weeks i set up a straight frontal attack with
   one key at a time  it only took twotwo days to crack the file
   no i do not have any faith in des
   

   taking this at face value though it seems quite dissonant with
   much else that has been published here about brute force des
   cracking unless russell was lucky with respect to the key i would be
   very interested in whether the program russell used is available

key search is very practical in many real situations since people use
such stupid keys on the average  password crackers know this well

   depending on his answer this could be an appalling development
   calling into question both des and rsades

not really  in fact public key based communication systems very
often pick keys automatically which are much better than passwords or
pass phrases

   if any bright programmer with a little idle machine time can crack
   a single des message in a couple of days assuming no tricks that
   are messagespecific

if a person picked the password or pass phrase then the key search is
pretty straightforward  in running english text the average content
of a single word is about eight bits  in pass phrases this may increase
to ten bits or so  searching thirtybit spaces is semipractical even in
software and searching fortybit spaces is not outrageous to imagine with
hardware assists of moderate size

by the way i am a walc white aryan lapsed catholic


dbaba duane m hentrich        babatymnetcom

   i would like to go on record as objecting to mr hentrich calling
himself an aryan  the word aryan is of sanskrit origin and occurs first
in the hindu scripture the rigveda  it seems to have been a tribal term
but may have had connotations of good character  such connotations
are quite explicit in the sayings of the buddha who called his religion the
eightfold aryan path   the word was borrowed by the german scholar
max mueller who used it as a synonym for indoeuropean but then the
nazis proceeded to steal it and started pretending that aryan is
synonymous with nordic which seems highly unlikely  the people who
originally called themselves aryas  the iranians noprth indians the afghans
and possibly the kurds are none of them nordic  so the use of the word
by westerners though meant with apparent good humor in this case is
nontheless inappropriate  the only westerners who may have some claim
to call themselves aryans by descent are the celts who seem to have wor
shipped a god called aryaman who is mentioned in the rigveda

  if you want to check what i am saying look at  mallorys book in
search of the indoeuropeans or just look at the encyclopedia britannica
the reason this usage is offensive is that most of ancient indian literature
as well as religion is directly or inderectly due to the aryans and
for westerners to butt in is really not nice not to mention the horrible
things done by germans to jews using a word to which the germans have
no clear claim

 syndrome  a group of us went to the restaurant and all shared six different
 dishes  it did not taste great but i decided it was not so bad  we went
 home and went to bed early  i woke up at two am and puked my guts outs
 i threw up for so long that i am not kidding i pulled a muscle in
 my tongue  dry heaves and everything  no one else got sick and i am
 not allergic to anything that i know of  
 
 suffice to say that i will not go into a chinese restaurant unless i am

 i have not gotten sick yet
 
  

i had a similar reaction to chinese food but came to a completly different
conclusion i have eaten chinese food for ages and never had problems i went
with some chinese malaysian friends to a swanky chinses rest and they ordered
lots of stuff i had never seen before the only thing i can remember of that
meal was the first course scallops served in the she will with a soytype sauce
i thought well i have only had scallops once and i was sick after but that
could have been a coincidence that night as i sat on the bathroom floor
sweating and emptying my stomach the hard way i decided i would never touch
another scallop i may not be allergic but i do not want to take the chance

the body at the proper door to start with

the final stages of denial i can hardly imagine what the result
would have been if the clinton administration had actually supported
this plan instead of merely acquiescing with repugnance as they have so
obviously doing  i do not believe the chip originated with the clinton
administration either but the clinton administration has embraced it
and brought it to fruition

both of the major parties have what they consider excellent reasons
for limiting your freedoms and violating your privacy and even seem
to feel that they are doing you a favor  if this is really surprising
to anyone it means they have been willfully ignoring quite a bit of
previous evidence  there is only one political party not calling
anarchists a party that considers your freedom and privacy goals
worthy in and of themselves  if you are voting for the big two you are
supporting a reduction of those rights given their goals and their
histories regardless of whether you personally support that
reduction  to paint clinton and gore as unwitting tools is really
stretching things

yes there could be that low sentences or high poverty could influence the
figures but they are still pretty high right
i also believe texas has some of the most liberal gunlaws in usa

texas only has liberal gun laws as far as purchasing a firearm aside 
from that it is probably more restrictive than most states as far as carry
goes


one state do not remember which texas tried to impose a rule that you could
only buy one gun each month think you all know what happened

the state was virginia and the law passed

i respect the right to defend yourself but that right should not inflict on
other people

that right only inflicts on those who threaten my rights to life

it is complete and there can be no further addition  the 
holy prophet muhammad saw closed the long line of messengers
allahs teaching is and will always be continuous but there
has been and will be no prophet after muhammad saw  the later
ages will want thinkers and revivers not prophets  this is not
an arbitrary matter  it is a decree full of knowledge and wisdom
for allah has full knowledge of all things

a treatise on the miracles of muhammed saw       

continued from droplet vol one no eleven part one

   second  sign   the  noble  messenger  saw
declared his prophethood and presented to humanity a
decree as the glorious quran and manifest miracles
which number according to the scholars one thousand
the occurrence of those miracles in their entirety is as
certain as the fact that he declared himself prophet  in
fact as a shown by the words of the  most obstinate
unbelievers quoted in various places of the wise
ouran even they could not deny the occurrence of his
miracles but only called them hasha wa kellaallah forbids 
sorcery in order to satisfy themselves or to deceive their
followers  the miracles of muhammad saw have the
certainty of confirmation by consensus of ulema scholars
of islam to the hundreth degree
   the miracle is the conformation by the creator of
the universe of his declaration of prophethood it has the
effect of the wordsyou have indeed spoken the truth 
   suppose that you said in the assembly of a ruler
while being observed by him the true ruler has
appointed me to such and such position  at a time when
you were asked to prove your claim the word yes
uttered by the ruler would sufficiently support you  or if
the ruler changed his usual practice and attitude at your
request this would confirm your claim even more soundly
and more definitely than would the word yes
   in the same way allahs most noble messenger
claimed i am the envoy of the creator of this
universe  my proof is that he will change his unbroken
order at my request and my prayer  now look at my
fingers  he makes them run like a fountain with five
spigots  look at the moon by a gesture of my finger he
splits it in two  look at that tree to affirm me and to bear
witness to me it moves and comes near to me  look at
this food although it is barely enough for two or three
men it satisfies two or three hundred  further he shows
hundreds of similar miracles  however the evidences  of
the veracity of this high being and the proofs of his
prophethood are not restricted to his miracles  all his
deeds and acts his words and behavior his moral
conduct and manners his character and appearance
prove to the attentive his truthfulness and seriousness
indeed many people  such  as  abdullah  b salam  the
famous scholar of the children of israel came to belief
merely by seeing him and said no lie can hide in this
face nor can any fraud be found in it
   although many of the  researchers have concluded
that the proofs of the prophethood of muhammad and his
miracles number about one thousand there are
thousands perhaps hundreds of thousands of proofs  of
his prophethood  and hundreds of thousands of
truthseeking men muhakkikiin with varying opinions
have affirmed his prophethood in an equal number of
ways
   the wise ouran alone demonstrates thousands of
the proofs of his prophethood in addition to its own forty
aspects of miraculousness  since prophethood is as a
phenomenon of humanity and hundreds of thousands of
individuals who claimed prophethood and performed
miracles have lived and passed away then the
prophethood of muhammad saw is of a certanity
superior to that of the prophethood of all the others  for
whatever evidences qualities  and attributes  became the
means of the prophethood and messengership of all the
messengers such as jesus as and moses as they
are all owned in a more perfect and comprehensive
fashion by muhammad saw  and since the causes and
means of prophetic authority exist more perfectly in the
person of muhammad saw this authority is to be found
in him with more certanity than all the other prophets

however if i were to design a bmws electronics i will use a counter to 
count the number of times the car passed one million miles or whatever and 
store it in the car computers memory this could be read when doing a 
diagnostics test ditto for the date of the odometer as easy as this is i 
do not know why manafucturers do not do it do not they to prevent illegal 
odometer tampering

but as a previous writer said it will in any case take aeons to reset an 
odometer mechanic or electronic by simulating a driving car it will be 
easier to reprogram it how i do not know

it should not be that hard if you know much about digital electronics  if the
counter is made with standard ttl chips all you should need to do is find
the chips used for counting figure out what mileage you want to put in
and preset it but wiring the preset pins directly to lowhigh you would also have
to know what the conventions are for low and high  it might be a little more
involved than this but it should not be beyond someone with a bsee or bs eet
all the display does is convert what the counter chips say into digits using
a translation table stored in rom

selah

dan

but those chips are probably inside a custom chip to make it smaller and
use less power and the presetdata pins are not going to be available
it would probably not be ttl but might be cmos 
wider operating voltage range not that the tecnology would make 
much difference
plus the custom chip would probably be potted encapsulated with epoxy
good luck

i am trying to help a friend of mine get the second serial port on his dtk
io plus ii card working and it does not want to cooperate the documentation
is no help at all as an example it says the serial port can be changed to
comtwo from comone by moving jumpers but does not say what jumpers to move 

there are two banks of jumpers the first one is labeled as follows
cone
ctwo
stwo
ptwo
pone
g

the second bank is labeled irq and has the following labels
fivec
fives
four
three
threes
twoc
twos

i have determined that the cone  ctwo jumpers tell it to address the first
serial port as comone or comtwo the poneptwo jumpers tell it to use the printer
port as lptone or lpttwo i am guessing that the g enables the game port and
the stwo should enable the second serial port but i cannot get it to work i
have tried numerous setting on the irq bank without success i assume that
this bank must tell the card which irqs to use for both ports but i dont
know how  any suggestions would be greatly appreciated

often indistinguishable from a poor one

the last sentence is ironic since so many readers of

josh mcdowell and cs lewis the above also expresses a rather odd sense
of history what makes you think the masses in aquinas day who were
mostly illiterate knew any more about rhetoric and logic than most people

why would apple release a duo dock with a processor of its own

here is why people have hounded apple for a notebook with a sixtyeight thousand and forty processor
in it apple cannot deliver that right now because the forty saps too much
power radiates far too much heat and is too large for a notebook how
does one get around that without designing a new chipset use existing
powerbook technology to your best advantage the duo dock gives apple a
unique ability to give users that forty power in a semiportable fashion
by plunking the forty into the dock you have got quadra power at your desk
on the road that thirtythreemhz sixtyeight thousand and thirty should be able to handle most of your needs
okay not the best solution but its an answer to a nowin situation 
so does this mean one will be able to use the powerbooks processor in
parallel to the docks processor okay we are getting really hypothetical
now 

it would also be great for another reason  when not docked it could serve
as an ara server to the large internal hd your corporate email etc  in
a pinch you would also have two machines instead of onefive

if they could couple that thought with rocketshare and let you use both the
thirty on the pb and the forty on the dock it would be a mighty powerful dock

jayne kulikauskas writes

i am uncomfortable with the tract in general because there seems to be 
an innappropriate emphasis on hell  god deserves our love and worship 
because of who he is  i do not like the idea of frightening people into 
accepting christ  

and yet jayne  as we read the gospels and in particular the topics that jesus
himself spoke on hell figures in a large  of the time certainly more than
heaven itself  paul as we learn in i thess taught new believers and new
churches eschatology and did not hesitate to teach hell and damnation  rev
chapter twentyelevenfifteen is very specific and cannot be allegorized  i think the word
throne is used fortyfive times in rev and that the unbelieving come to receive the
assignment of the severity of judgement for in john three we read that they are
already judged  rom three speaks that every mouth will be shut  there is no
recourse excuse or defense

i see evangelism as combining a way of living that shows gods love with 
putting into words and explaining that love  preaching the gospel 
without living the gospel is no better than being a noisy gong or a 
clanging cymbal

yes i agree with you  life is often like a pendulum where it swings to
extremes before stopping at moderation  i think we have seen the extreme of
the hell fire  brimstone preacher but also we have seen the other extreme
where hell not talked about at all for fear of offending someone is
sensibilities

i forget who founded the word of life ministries but i remember him telling a
story  he was in a small town hardware store and some how a man got to the
point of telling him that he did not believe in satan or hell  he believed
everybody was going to heaven  it was at this point that the man was asked to
pray to god that he would send his children to hell  of course the man
would not do it  but the point was made  many people say they do not believe in
hell but they are not willing to really place their faith in that it does not
exist  if this man had he would of prayed the prayer because hell did not
exist and there would have been no fear in having his prayer answered  and
yet they walk as if they believe they will never be sent there

i would use a different illustration however  i have to include myself in it 
when i watch say a basketball go bulls game and i see a blatant foul that
is not called oi vey  what is with that ref that he did not make that call 
it is unfair  and just so in life righteousness demands payment  as the
surgeon takes knife in hand to cut the cancer away so god cuts off that which
is still of the old creation  we must preach the gospel in all its richness
which includes the fact that if you reject the way and the truth and the life
then broad is the way to distruction


here is a question  how many of you are christians because you are 
afraid of going to hell  how many are responding to gods love

i think i would fall in there somewhere  actually it was both  after all
repentance is not only a turning towards but also a turning away from
no again if jesus used it in his ministry then i can surely see that we
should do it also  in love of course but in truth most assuredly  

i have thought about writing something on this topic but not now and here  i
would say that there are some good reasons for its existence and its
eternality

one god is light  yes he is love but his love has the boundary of holiness
two dignity of man  either a man is a robot or he is a responsible creature
   if responsible then he is also accountable
three the awfulness of sin  today we have a poor poor concept of sin  god
four christ  he was willing to die and go there himself to offer an avenue to
   the whosoever will

the scout oath specifically the promise to live morally straight

there is really nothing else to discuss  trying to cloud the issue

because it is like comparing apples to oranges ie people cannot
control their race but they can control their behavior

what else is there to possibly discuss on recscouting on this issue
nobody including bsa is denying anybody the right to live andor
worship as they please or do not please  but it does not mean that bsa
is the big bad wolf for adhering to the recognized positive religious

fitzmyer is one of the preeminent modern nt scholars  he was also one
of the early workers on the dss  his book is written in a

may fix the problem note not known to work on solaris


subject  ninetyfive  why does not my sun with sunos fourone know about dlsym etc

	if you get errors with dlsym dlopen dlclose undefined link with 
libdla  add ldl to your and eventually your sitedef  you may want to 
surround it with bstatic ldl bdynamic if you add it to the extralibraries
variable since syslibs get added after extralibraries on the eventual 
compilation command otherwise you may not have a shared libdl  or compile 
the stubs shared

subject  ninetyseven  why cannot gcc compile xelevenrfour on my sparc
i used gcc to compile the whole distribution but i get several segmentation
faults when running x

	note first that gcc on risc machines does not necessarily result in
any performance increase it certainly is not as noticeable as it is on the
six hundred and eightyxzero or vax platforms

	here is the problem gcc and cc use incompatible methods of passing 
structures as arguments and returning them as function values so when 
gcccompiled parts of x are linked with sunsupplied functions that pass or 
return structs runtime errors occur  affected programs include rgb and 
the server

	this is from the gcc manual

	on the sparc gnu cc uses an incompatible calling convention for 
	structures  it passes them by including their contents in the argument
	list whereas the standard compiler passes them effectively by 
	reference

	this really ought to be fixed but such calling conventions are not yet
	supported in gnu cc so it is not straightforward to fix it

	the convention for structure returning is also incompatible and
	fpccstructreturn does not help

you can duck the problem either by using cc throughout or by using it for just
the routines which because incompatibilities the problem cannot be solved with 
compilation flags  

	files which need to be compiled using cc include
		serverosfourtwobsdoscolorc 
		rgbrgbc

	in addition several of the inet functions use structs as args or
return values  
		clientsxhostxhostc 
		clientsxauthgethostc 
calls to inetaddr in libclxsocketc and libxxconndisc are possibly 
harmless as they do not involve structs

interest it should be identical modulo irrelevant differences like 
whitespace  if the gcc version has x where the cc version has i your 
fixincludes run did not work for some reason or other go back to your gcc
sources and run fixincludes then rebuild the x distribution if they are 
identical try running a make clean in mitserver and rebuilding just to make 
sure everything gets compiled with the proper include files

in mitserverddxsunsuncgthreecc we have found missing defines for 
cgthreeacmonolen cgthreebcmonolen cgthreeacenblen cgthreebcenblen what should these be

	the rfour errata list distributed after xelevenrfour mentions that you can add
these lines to the file on older sunos versions eg threefive to compile
        define cgthreeacmonolen one hundred and twentyeightone thousand and twentyfour
        define cgthreeacenblen  cgthreeacmonolen
        define cgthreebcmonolen cgthreeacmonolen
        define cgthreebcenblen  cgthreeacmonolen

	however the sunthree should not actually ever have the cgthree device and so 
references to it can be removed from mitserverddxsunsuninitc and the 
imakefile  elevenninety

subject one hundred and one  what are these problems using rfour shared libraries on sunos four
all of the executables that i try to run have the following results
	ldso libxmusofour not found
or even
	ldso call to undefined procedure gethostname from zeroxfseven hundred and seventysixaninetysixc

	if you are building with shared libraries on a sun remember that you 
need to run ldconfig as root after installing the shared libraries if you have
installed x on a fileserver run it on the servers clients too  while 
building and installing the distribution you need to be careful to avoid 
linking against any existing x shared libraries you might have eg those 
distributed with openwindows  you should make sure you do not have 
ldlibrarypath set in your environment during the build or the installation  
if you are going to keep xterm and xload as setuid programs please note that 
the shared libraries must be installed in usrlib usrlocallib or 
usrfivelib for these programs to work or else those programs must be linked 
statically courtesy mit x consortium
	note also that the program mkfontdir is run as part of the build it
attempts however to use the shared libraries before they have been installed
you can avoid the errors by building mkfontdir statically pass bstatic to
most c compilers


subject one hundred and two  can olit programs run with rfive xt xtqstring undefined

this is a bug in the olit  xtqstring was an external symbol that existed in 
xelevenrfour upon which ow threezeros libxt is based  it was not documented and was 
removed in xelevenrfive mits guarantee of upward compatibility between the rfour and rfive
libraries only applied to the documented interface  

a workaround is to temporarily set your ldlibrarypath to point to the xelevenrfour
or openwindows xt library that you linked the program against

subject one hundred and three  how do i get around the sunos fourone security hole

	there is a security problem with certain rfour clients xterm and xload
running under sunos fourone that have been installed setuid root and are using 
shared libraries to avoid the problem do one of these
	one make the program nonsetuid you should consult your system
administrator concerning protection of resources eg ptys and devkmem used
by these programs to make sure that you do not create additional security 
problems at your site
	two relink the programs statically using bstatic
	three install the libraries before linking and link with absolute paths
to the libraries

from rwsexpolcsmitedu bob scheifler twelveninety

the rfive version of xterm does this automatically by rebuilding xterm against the
newlyinstalled libraries when xterm is being installed this prevents an suid
program from being built with libraries specified relatively note that this 
may cause an inconvenience when doing the installation from nfsmounted disks 
xload has been rewritten to avoid the problem


subject one hundred and four  how do i get around the framebuffer security hole

	on many systems the framebuffer is unsecured by default this permits 
anyone who can log into your workstation to peek at your windowing session by 
accessing the framebuffer directly or as less of a privacy issue but perhaps
more annoying to accidentally start up a second x session on your console 
display check the man page for fbtabfive

subject one hundred and five  topic building x programs 

subject one hundred and six  what is imake

	imake is not a replacement for the make program instead it is a
makefilegenerator that takes advantages of the includefile and macro
processing capabilities of the c preprocessor cpp to generate makefiles 
suitable for building software on a particular system although it is not 
specific to x the x release uses it to help solve a number of the 
configuration issues that arise in making such a large system widely portable
	imake has a fairly steep learning curve in part because the process by
which the systemspecific configuration files systemindependent configuration
files and individual imakefiles are melded to produce a makefile is not 
obvious
	there have been several different versions of imake the rthree rfour and
rfive versions are different

	you can obtain information on imake from these sources
	 the rfour and rfive release notes and imake man page include information on
using imake to build x
	 the rfour and rfive file mitconfigreadme also contains useful information
	 on the rfour tapes contribdocimakeimaketex is mark moraes rthreerfour
guide to imake
	 the rfive mitdocconfigusenixwspaperms contains a paper by jim
fulton on an early version of imake
	 paul dubois duboisprimatewiscedu has written a useful 
explanation of how imake works and how to use it in configuring x for non

subject one hundred and seven  where can i get imake

	versions are distributed with the rfour and rfive releases an earlier 
version is distributed with the xelevenrthree release some thirdparty toolkits 
redistribute versions of imake along with their own implementations of the 
template and configuration files there are no real standards for such 
configuration files although most current contributed software expects the 
templates distributed with xelevenrfive
	export contains the rfive distribution unpacked so you can pick up imake
without picking up the entire distribution
	a standalone version of imake but one stemming from xelevenrfive is in
ftpgermanyeunetpubxelevenmiscimakeimakepuretarz one hundred and ninetytwoseventysixone hundred and fortyfourseventyfive


subject one hundred and eight  i have a program with an imakefile but no makefile what to do

	if you have rfour or rfive installed on your system run xmkmf this is a 
script which runs imake for you with the correct arguments the output is a 
makefile configured for your system and based on the imakefile then run make 
which will use that new makefile to compile the program


subject one hundred and nine  why cannot i link to the xlib shape routines
when i try to compile certain programs i get the following link error
	undefined
	xshapequeryextension
	xshapecombinemask

	these routines are actually part of the shape extension to x shape
which was introduced in the mit xelevenrfour distribution and allows nonrectangular
windows  like the other sample server extensions the shape extension will 
only run on a server which supports it  prexelevenrfour servers as well as many 
vendorsupplied servers do not support the shape extension in which case 
they will display rectangular windows anyway

	in order to use the shape extension you must link to the library 
libxexta  in the xelevenrfour distribution this library and the associated includes
will be in the mitextensions directory  if you do not have these files do 
not despair  many freeware programs which use the shape extension can also be 
compiled without it by removing the dshape define from the makefile you can
probably do this and compile successfully against your older vendorsupplied x 
libraries

subject one hundred and ten  what are these problems with xtinherit not found on the sun
when i run a x program that i wrote on a sunos fourzerothree or fourone machine i get the 
error ldso symbol not found xtinherit

	what you are seeing is a sideeffect of a kludge in the rfour libxta to 
get sun shared libraries working  apparently you cannot share a function that 
is both called and compared as xtinherit is this was handled by putting 
xtinherit in the same file as a function that is always used thereby 
guaranteeing that it would be loaded  that is in initializec where 
xttoolkitinitialize and xtinitialize reside these routines would normally
be called

	you are probably seeing this error because your program is not a normal
xtbased program and does not call xttoolkitinitialize anywhere 
	one it may be a program that uses xt functions but never opens a 
connection to the x server  osfmotifs oneonezero uil had this problem it called
xtmalloc and other xt functions the solution is to add the call to your 
program the function does not have to be executed just linked in
	two alternatively your program does not need any xt functions and is
correct in not calling xttoolkitinitialize  it may be an xlib or xview 
program in this case you can remove lxt from your link command 

	it should not be necessary to link the shared libraries statically
although this will certainly solve the problem

subject one hundred and twelve  topic programming problems and puzzles

subject one hundred and thirteen  why does not my program get the keystrokes i select for sic

	the window manager controls how the input focus is transferred from one
window to another  in order to get keystrokes your program must ask the
window manager for the input focus  to do this you must set up what are
called hints for the window manager  if your applications is xlibbased you
can use something like the following

        xwmhints wmhints
        
        wmhintsflags  inputhint
        wmhintsinput  true
        xsetwmhintsdpy window wmhints

if your application is based on the xt intrinsics you can set the xtninput 
resource to be true as you probably want to in any case if you do not have
source you can start up the application with the resource inputtrue

certain window managers notably dxwm and olwm are very picky about having 
this done 

	if you are using suns openwindows olwm you can also add this resource
to your defaults file to use clients that are not icccmcompliant
	openwindowsfocuslenience       true

mostly courtesy dave lemke of ncd and stuart marks of sun


subject one hundred and fourteen  how do i figure out what window manager is running

	you cannot reliably tell whatever mechanism you could use could be
spoofed in any case 
	for most cases you should not care which window manager is running so 
long as you do things in an icccmconformant manner there are some cases in 
which particular window managers are known to do things wrong checking for
particular hints placed on the window by the window manager so that you can 
sidestep the problem may be appropriate in these cases alternatively it may 
be appropriate to determine which window manager is running in order to take
advantage of specific added features such as olwms pushpin menus in order
to give your program added functionality beware of usurping the window 
managers functions by providing that functionality even when it is missing
this surely leads to future compatibility problems


subject one hundred and fifteen  is there a skeleton x program available
	
	there is no general framework such as the transskel program for the 
macintosh which handles lots of the odds and ends and overhead of development 
under a window system and which can be used as a platform for additional 
development in x the problem is typically solved by using an interactive 
application builder tool or by using cutpaste on existing x applications good
applications which you might look to manipulate when you want to test just 
this one little thing include contribclientsxskel a simple rfour program that 
puts up a window and allows sketching in it and offers a starting point for
quick hacks the xaw examples in the examples directory in the rthree and rfour 
distributions and the xlib hello world example in the rthree dochelloworld and 
rfour doctutorialshelloworld an updated version of this program which uses rfour 
xlib calls and current icccm conventions was posted in twoninety to compwindowsx  
by glenn widener of tektronix 	threeninety

	in addition a sample xt program for xaw or xm by rainer klute 
showing how to open multiple displays and how to catch a broken display 
connection is available on exportlcsmitedu in contribmdisptarz fourninetytwo


subject one hundred and sixteen  why does xtgetvalues not work for me sic

	the xtgetvalues interface for retrieving resources from a widget is
sensitive to the type of variable your code may be doing something like this
	
	arg argsthree
	int i
	int sensitive		 oops wrong data type 
	izero
	xtsetarg argsi xtnsensitive sensitive i
	xtgetvalueswidget args i 
	
	

but xtnsensitive is a boolean which on most machines is a single byte 
declaring the variable sensitive as boolean works properly this problem 
comes up often when using particular toolkits that redefine the xt types 
dimension and position code that assumes they are int will have similar 
problems if those types are actually short in general you are safe if you
use the actual type of the resource as it appears in the widgets man page
elevenninety


subject one hundred and seventeen  why do not xtconfigurewidgetxtresizewidgetxtmovewidget work

	you are probably trying to use these functions from application code
they should be used only internally to widgets these functions are for a 
parent widget to change the geometry of its children other promising 
functions xtmakegeometryrequest and xtmakeresizerequest are also for use 
only by widgets in this case by a child to request a change from its parent
	the only way for your application to request a geometry change for a
widget is to issue an xtsetvalues call setting some of the geometry resources
although this will result in the widgetinternal functions being called your
application code must use the standard xtsetvalues interface or risk the 
widgets data becoming corrupted
	the xlib calls xmovewindow and xresizewindow should similarly be 
avoided they should not be used to change xtnx xtny xtnwidth or xtnheight


subject one hundred and eighteen  why is not there an xtreparentwidget call like xreparentwindow

	although there are various details of the current implementation of
the xt internals which make reparenting difficult the major reason that no
such call exists is that it remains undefined what the set of resources for
the new widget should be resources are typically set based on the location
in the instance hierarchy what resources should change if the instance moves
what should happen to the widgets children and by the time such semantics are
defined there would probably be little advantage over destroying the old 
widget and creating a new widget in the correct location with the desired 
resources as setting the resources correctly is the majority of work in 
creating a new widget

	note that reparenting is possible in the oi toolkit

the media is beating the incident at dodger stadium on wednesday to
death but i have not seen anything in rsb yet

gerald perry of the cardinals pinch hit in the eighth inning with two
on and his club down by a run  he stroked a line drive into the
right field corner  the ball cleared the threefoot high fence and
went into the crowd  darryl racing over from right center got to
the spot in time to reach his glove up over the short fence but he
missed the ball  a fan sitting in the front row wearing a mitt
reached up and caught the ball  home run

now i have seen the replay several times and i have concluded that
darryl missed the ball and that the fans glove was essentially
behind darryls  several dodger fans with seats in the immediate
vicinity have claimed that the fan unquestionably interfered with
strawberry  what cannot be disputed however is that the fan
who caught the ball never took his eye off it  he was oblivious
to where the fielder was playing  he was also quite exuberant as
soon as he realized he had made the catch

that exuberance disappeared immediately however when strawberry
went into a tirade at the man  all reports indicate he used a lot
of profanity and accused the man of interference and therefore of
costing the dodgers a game  shortly afterwards other fans hurled
food and beverages toward the man who made the catch  dodger stadium
officials started to remove him from the park but then relented and
just relocated him to another area  in an interview after the game
lasorda blamed the fan for the loss  strawberry also went into a
tirade about how the fans are stupid and they do not care about 
winning  la times columnists similarly blasted the man who made
the catch

before each dodger game the public address announcer makes a speech
wherein he says that fans are welcome to the souvenirs of balls that
are hit into the stands as long as they do not interfere with any 
that are in the field of play  was the fan wrong  should he have
been more aware of the situation and acted to avoid any possibility
of interference  or was he human and just reacting  by the way he
is a season ticket holder and on his request the dodgers have relocated
his seats to another area of the stadium where future interference is
impossible

others have questioned why darryl should be so concerned with what
the fan did when he has a grand total of one rbi through the first
nine games

i question what he was doing in right center with a lefthanded pull
hitter up and the game on the line  had he been closer to the play
he certainly would have had a much better chance of catching the ball

but i guess the big debate continues as to what are the responsibilities
of the fan

in article one thousand nine hundred and ninetythreemarthirtyone hundred and eightyone thousand six hundred and thirtysixtwentytwo thousand seven hundred and fiftysixpmafireinelgov 
cdmpmafireinelgov dale cook said

 a real world data point a person has a much stronger legal claim for
 harrassment sexual or otherwise if they make it clear to the
 offender that their behaviour is unwanted  if the behaviour persists
 harrassment is much easier to demonstrate due to the fact that the
 offender knew that the behaviour was unwanted

no argument here my original query regarded the question of why the
first sexual proposition made by person a to person b would be
considered to be sexual harassment by somemany people  assuming of
course that there does not exist a power relationship between a and b
such that the proposition carries strong implications of extortion right
from word one

i can only say that those people are wrong the word harass means to 
irritate or torment persistently i would hardly consider one time to fall
under the definition of persistent  additionally there is no basis
to assume the behaviour is unwanted unlike an illegal proposition

 of course i think the original question of offering money for sex is
 inarguably harrassment because the activity is illegal and could be
 presumed to be unwanted by the average citizen

i have to take issue with this viewpoint given that a prostitution
is a victimless crime and b there are literally millions of americans
who participate in some sort of victimless activities which the state
has defined to be criminal eg prostitution obscenity gambling
using certain recreational drugs having nonmercenary sex with persons
not ones spouse in certain states having unnatural sex with people
regardless of marital status or exchange of money in certain states
etc i would have to say that the idea that an activity may be presumed to
be unwanted by the average citizen merely because it is illegal is the
sort of sophistry that only a judge could indulge in with a straight
face  he said speaking as a law student who is read his share of
judicial opinions in which reality was not only denied but in fact
actually inverted in order to make the universe conform to the writers
politics

i was speaking from a legalistic viewpoint  what you say is true but
the law in order to make what little sense it manages to make has to
make some assumptions  assuming that an illegal activity is unwanted
by the average citizen i think is reasonable  certainly i would need
a preponderance of evidence on the side of the propositioner that there
was a reasonable belief that the proposition was welcome

the number of people who participate in victimless crimes notwithstanding
the fact reamins that under the law the activity is illegal  to presume
that the proposition is welcome simply because a large number of people
indulge in it is the type of sophistry only a lawyer could indulge in
with a straight face

one is israels occupation of southern lebanon temporary

	israel has repeatedly stated that it will leave lebanon when
the lebanese government can provide guarantees that israel will not be
attacked from lebanese soil and when the syrians leave

not acceptable syria and lebanon have a right to determine if
they wish to return to the situation prior to the french invasion
where they were both part of the same mandate territory  read
colony

	and lebanon has a right to make this decision without syrian
troops controlling the country  until syria leaves and free
elections take place its is rediculous to claim that the lebanese
would even be involved in determining what happens to their country

israel has no right to determine what happens in lebanon invading another
country because you consider them a threat is precisely the way that almost
all wars of aggression have started

	i expect you will agree that the same holds true for syria
having no right to be in lebanon

	israel has already annexed areas taken over in the one thousand nine hundred and sixtyseven war
these areas are not occupied but disputed since there is no
legitamate governing body  citizenship was given to those residents
in annexed areas who wanted citizenship

the un defines them as occupied they are recognised as such by every
nation on earth excluding one small caribean island

	the un also thought zionism is racism  that fails to make it true

	the first reason was security  a large jewish presense makes
it difficult for terrorists to infiltrate  a jewish settlements also
act as fortresses in times of war

theyu also are a liability we are talking about civilian encampments that
would last no more than hours against tanks

	they lasted weeks against tanks in fortyeight and stopped those
tanks from advancing  they also lasted days in seventythree  there is little
evidence for the claim that they are military liabilities

	they evidence is there to show that when infiltrations take
place over the jordan river the existance of large patrolled
kibutzim forces terrorists into a very small area where they are
usually picked up in the morning

	a second reason was political  creating settlements brought
the arabs to the negotiation table  had the creation of new towns and
cities gone on another several years there would be no place left in
israel where there was an arab majority  there would have been no
land left that could be called arab

do not fool yourself it was the gulf war that brought the israelis to the
negotiating table once their us backers had a secure base in the gulf
they insrtructed shamir to negotiate or else

	nonsense  israel has been trying to get its neighbors to the
negotiating table for forty years  it was the gulf war that brought the
arabs to the table not the israelis

	the point is there are many reasons people moved over the
green line and many reasons the government wanted them to  whatever
status is negotiated for disputed territories it will not be an all
or nothing deal  new boundaries will be drawn up by negotiation not
be the results of a war

unless the new boundaries drawn up are those of fortyeight there will be no peace
araffat has precious little authority to agree to anything else

	nonsense  according to arafat israel must be destroyed  he
has never come clean and denied that this is his plan  he always
waffles on what he means

	when the arabs set off their volcano there will only be arabs in
	this part of the world  our people will continue to fuel the torch
	of the revolution with rivers of blood until the whole of the
	occupied homeland is liberated

to natural therapies isbn zerofourteeneight thousand five hundred and sixtyonezero new york viking penguin one thousand nine hundred and eightysix
ptwo hundred and eleven pone hundred and eightyeight  a notoverly critical but still useful overview of thirtytwo
alternative health therapies

  the russian engineer semyon kirlian and his wife valentina during the
  one thousand nine hundred and fiftys  using alternating currents of high frequency to illuminate
  their subjects they photographed them  they found that if an object
  was a good conductor such as a metal the picture showed only its
  surface while the pictures of poor conductors showed the inner
  structure of the object even if it were optically opaque  they found
  too that these high frequency pictures could distinguish between dead
  and living objects  dead ones had a constant outline whilst living ones
  were subject to changes  the objects life activity was also visible in
  highly variable colour patterns

  high frequency photography has now been practised for twenty years in
  the soviet union but only a few people in the west have taken it up
  seriously  professor douglas dean in new york and professor philips at
  washington university in st louis have produced kirlian photographs and
  others have been produced in brazil austria and germany

  using kirlian photography it is possible to show an aura around peoples
  fingers notably around those of healers who are concentrating on
  healing someone  normally blue and white rays emanate from the fingers
  but when a subject becomes angry or excited the aura turns red and
  spotty  the soviets are now using kirlian photography to diagnose
  diseases which cannot be diagnosed by any other method  they argue that
  in most illnesses there is a preclinical stage during which the person
  is not actually ill but is about to be  they claim to be able to
  foretell a disease by photographing its preclinical phase

  but the most exciting phenomenon illustrated by kirlian photography is
  the phantom effect  during high frequency photography of a leaf from
  which a part had been cut the photograph gave a complete picture of the
  leaf with the removed part showing up faintly  this is extremely
  important because it backs up the experiences of psychics who can see
  the legs of amputees as if they were still there  the important thing
  about the kirlian phantoms though is that the electromagnetic pattern
  cannot possibly represent a secondary phenomenon  or the field would
  vanish when the piece of leaf or leg vanished  the energy grid
  contained in a living object must therefore be far more significant than
  the actual object itself

  has a much richer energy field around it than ordinary water

  study making grand discoveries in his basement  many paranormal
  movements can be traced back to such people  kirlian photography for
  instance  if you pump highvoltage electricity into anything it will
  emit glowing sparks common knowledge to electrical workers and
  hobbyists for a century  it took a lone basement crank to declare that
  the sparks represent some sort of spiritual aura  in fact kirlian
  photography was subjected to rigorous testing by physicists john o
  pehek harry j kyler and david l faust who reported their findings
  in the october fifteen one thousand nine hundred and seventysix issue of science  their conclusion the
  variations observed in kirlian photographs are due solely to moisture on
  the surface of the body and not to mysterious auras or even
  necessarily to changes in mood or mental state  nevertheless
  television shows magazines and books many by famous
  parapsychologists continue to promote kirlian photography as proof of
  the unknown

in article  lmvecwestminsteracuk william hargreaves writes

	   i am a commited christian that is battling with a problem  i know
that romans talks about how we are saved by our faith not our deeds yet
hebrews and james say that faith without deeds is useless saying you fools
do you still think that just believing is enough

actually i do not think there is any conflict if we really understand
what these passages say  first what is faith  if you study the 
meaning of the greek and hebrew words so translated i think you will
come to the conclusion that the word means a lot more than mere 
belief  faith means both trust and action  if you do not put your 
belief into action it simply cannot qualify as faith  i think this 
is what james means when he says that faith without works is dead 
and i will show you my faith by my works  remember james was 
writing to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad  this 
probably means he was writing to those who would hear the gospel much 
later and would not understand the meaning of the original greek
indeed i suspect james was writing to us today among others he
intended to reach  paul on the other hand wrote mostly to the
people of the roman empire who generally understood the meaning of
the greek

another key to why there is no conflict is to look at pauls
statements in their context  i think you will find that when paul
contrasts faith and works it is in the context of comparing the
gospel with the law meaning the law of moses  this was the great
burden of pauls life  as the apostle to the gentiles he would go
convert a bunch of people then the judizers would come along and
try to convince them that they also had to obey the law of moses cf
acts chapter fifteen  in this context paul condemns the idea of being
saved by the works of the law saying that we are saved by the blood
of jesus and our faith in him  i believe that a better translation
for today would be that we are saved by faithfulness  i think
faithfulness today has a meaning closer to what the original
writers intended

now if someone is fully believing but there life is totally lead by themselves
and not by god according to romans that person is still saved by there faith

i think you misunderstand romans  what paul is really saying is
that god prefers a faithful gentile who does not keep kosher to a
kosher jew who fails to stay faithful in the more important matters
of following the lord and having charity toward his fellows

but then there is the bit which says that god preferes someone who is cold to
him ie does not know him  condemned so a lukewarm christian someone who
knows and believes in god but does not make any attempt to live by the bible

in the sense of faith described above you cannot have real faith and 
be lukewarm  if you know god but are lukewarm unfaithful you are 
worse off than the person who never heard of him  remember jesus in
the parable of the pearl of great price mat thirteenfortyfivefortysix and again in
the one on the treasure hidden in the field mat thirteenfortyfour indicates that
the price of the kingdom of god is all we have

i agree with you in general including the fact that pistis has
some of the force of faithful  however if you take that too far
you can end up with something that paul definitely would not have
intended  being faithful means following god in all things  to say
that we are saved by being faithful is very close to saying that we
are saved by commiting no sins  i assume that is not what you meant

i have almost given up on finding a specific verbal formula that
completely captures this  however i think paul is describing what i would
call a basic orientation including aspects such as trust and
commitment  jesus speaks of it as rebirth which implies a basic
change  we may still do things that are sinful and may fail to show
the new life in christ in many situations where we should  but in any
christian there had better be the basic change in orientation that
jesus calls being born again

ninefortyfive am edt

	     	  
	     q	  why was the tenzero am postponed 
	     	  
	     ms myers  just due to scheduling conflicts  so as we 
put out the president will meet with the leaders of the national 
police organizations at twozero pm in the rose garden as opposed to 
tenzero am  the only other things on his schedule today are  at 
elevenzero am he will meet with general vessey who as you know is on 
his way to vietnam to continue working on the miapow issue  at 
twelvethirty pm he will have lunch with the vice president in the oval 
office  and at twozero pm he will meet with the police organizations
then from threezero pm to fourzero pm he will do his weekly photos with the 
various groups
	     
	     q	  a photo op with vessey
	     
	     ms myers  there is no coverage on the vessey meeting
	     
	     q	  why
	     
	     ms myers  why  it is a closed meeting  
	     
	     q	  what about the lunch
	     
	     ms myers  the lunch  no there is no coverage
	     
	     q	  is he meeting with any congress people today
	     
	     ms myers  nothing scheduled
	     
	     q	  there are no meetings 
	     
	     ms myers  there are no congressional meetings today 
no
	     
	     q	  has the president been given any information by the 
pentagon or reached any conclusion about the validity of this report 
from hanoi  any instructions to vessey on how to deal with the 
vietnamese on that subject
	     
	     ms myers  well clearly the report is the first order 
of business  it is high on the agenda on something that they will 
discuss  i think the president and general vessey will discuss the 
parameters of his visit to vietnam today but the president has not 
drawn any conclusions about the report yet  certainly it is 
something that he wants general vessey to talk with the vietnamese 
about first
	     
	     q	  did the president talk with any republican senators 
yesterday about the stimulus package
	     
	     ms myers  he spoke with senator dole
	     
	     q	  how many times
	     
	     ms myers  i believe once during the day and once last 
night
	     
	     q	  what was the outcome of that
	     
	     ms myers  they are continuing to work toward some kind 
of an agreement on a jobs package
	     
	     q	  is it your impression that senator dole is in any 
way flexible on this
	     
	     ms myers  well i think we are hopeful that we are going 
to get some kind of jobs package through the senate and we will 
continue to work with senator dole and others until we reach some 
kind of an agreement
	     
	     q	  did they discuss the vat tax
	     
	     ms myers  i do not know if that came up
	     
	     q	  can you check that
	     
	     ms myers  sure

	     q	  so what are they  is the president offering to 
scale down his program  is that what he is trying to do buy it down 
to where dole will sign on
	     
	     ms myers  well he is trying to protect as much of it 
as he can  but it is important to him to get some kind of a jobs 
package through the senate and through congress now  and as soon as 
we reach some conclusions on that we will let you know  but at the 
moment he is continuing to consult with members of congress 
including obviously senator dole
	     
	     q	  is he talking to anybody else
	     
	     ms myers  i do not believe he talked to any other 
republicans yesterday
	     
	     q	  is he talking to anybody today
	     
	     ms myers  i do not think anything is scheduled but i 
would not rule it out
	     
	     q	  we were led to believe that the president called 
mr dole on the subject of russian aid and that bob dole brought the 
conversation around to stimulus package  is that correct
	     
	     ms myers  i think the president has contacted several 
people on russian aid  i think that it was always expected that the 
stimulus package or the jobs package will be part of any conversation 
he would have with senator dole  the primary objective of the 
conversation was russian aid  that was the first order of business 
but it was both
	     
	     q	  in the presidents mind are they linked 
politically in that if the republicans continue to reject the 
stimulus package he thinks it will be harder to sell russian aid to 
the american people  has he made that argument
	     
	     ms myers  i cannot talk about specifically what 
arguments he might have made  the president is obviously committed 
to both  he liked to see a jobs package to the american people 
first  but as you know we outlined the details of additional 
russian aid last night in tokyo
	     
	     q	  but does the president believe that the stimulus 
package will make it more difficult to persuade americans to vote for 
russian  to accept a vote for russian aid
	     
	     ms myers  i think that the president is going to 
continue to work to pass the stimulus package to pass a jobs 
package and we are still hopeful that we will get some kind of jobs 
package through the congress
	     
	     q	  is it fair to say that the president is negotiating 
now with dole
	     
	     ms myers  he is discussing options with him
	     
	     q	  on the stimulus is it your understanding that over 
the break some democrats themselves have left the support that they 
had earlier for the package the stimulus package
	     
	     ms myers  i think we still have wide support in the 
senate for the jobs package
	     
	     q	  but specifically that you have lost democrats other 
than shelby
	     
	     ms myers  i do not believe so  there has not been a 
vote
	     
	     q	  what about kohl
	     
	     q	  kohl and feingold
	     
	     ms myers  there has not been a vote yet  and we will 
continue to work with senators to try to get a majority to try to 
bring the package to a vote because we believe that a majority of 
the members of the united states senate support the package
	     
	     q	  if you are were not worried about kohl and feingold 
why did george mention milwaukee projects the other day
	     
	     ms myers  i think george pointed out a number of 
projects in a number of states that stand to be funded or to lose 
funding if this jobs package does not pass
	     
	     q	  no democrats  laughter
	     
	     ms myers  i will let you draw your own conclusions
	     
	     q	  does he plan to talk to dole again today or any 
other republicans again today
	     
	     ms myers  there is nothing specifically scheduled but 
again i would not rule it out
	     
	     q	  does he plan to put out any more press releases to 
any other states today
	     
	     ms myers  what we have done is we are in the process of 
breaking down the benefits of the jobs package state by state  i 
think it is entirely feasible that as we sort of are able to sum those 
up we will send out press releases to the various states that suggest 
how their states would benefit from this package
	     
	     q	  will you share those with us
	     
	     ms myers  sure  as we did yesterday
	     
	     q	  do you have copies of the ones you sent 
	     
	     ms myers  yes we made those available yesterday  and 
we certainly can continue to provide them today
	     
	     q	  dee dee since yesterdays questions and subsequent 
stories about the vat what further consideration of this issue has 
been given
	     
	     ms myers  nothings changed since yesterday  i think 
the president commented on it this morning to say only that it was 
something he knew was being considered by the task force and that he 
has not made a decision on and i do not think we have anything to add 
to that
	     
	     q	  but he also said that business and labor groups are 
telling him they support it  can you tell us 
	     
	     ms myers  i think that there has been  i am not going 
to speculate on who supports it  i think the president said that 
there has been some support among business and labor groups  i do not 
think he said he was directly contacted by them
	     
	     q	  are we to take that to mean that the administration 
has sounded out business and labor groups on this 
	     
	     ms myers  i think there is been plenty of public 
discourse on this over the years and even recently but i do not think 
i want to add to that
	     
	     q	  in february though the president said that this 
was something to be considered ten or fifteen years down the road  what 
has happened between then and now to cause this administration to 
change its mind
	     
	     ms myers  i think as we said yesterday it is 
something that the working groups are looking at  they are 
considering a wide variety of options on everything from funding to 
specific options that will be covered by the presidents health care 
plan  the president has not taken it up yet has not made a decision 
on it  and beyond that i do not have anything to add
	     
	     q	  you have not answered the question  it was not being 
considered by anyone in the white house after the presidents 
comments in february and george reaffirmed that in a briefing
	     
	     q	  and then suddenly 
	     
	     q	  what happened

	     ms myers  the working groups as we have said 
throughout we instructed to consider a wide variety of options 
acrosstheboard  and one of the things that has been talked about 
and that they are clearly considering is some kind of a valueadded 
tax

	     q	  but the president himself took this off the table 
dee dee and suddenly it reappears  and this goes to the credibility 
of this administration in a way  what has happened in the meantime

	     ms myers  the president has not looked at this it 
has not been presented to him again yet  the working groups are 
looking at it as they are looking at a wide variety of options and 
no decisions have been made

	     q	  and it raises the question of how independently the 
task force is working

	     ms myers  the task force was instructed to consider 
all options and they have taken that mandate seriously and they are 
considering all options

	     q	  but that is not the impression that the president 
left in february  the impression he left was that this was something 
that was longrange to be looked at ten fifteen years down the road  the 
clear implication of his remarks was that this was something that was 
not on the table not an option 

	     q	  if it changes i will tell you
	     
	     q	  bring him on

	     q	  and you repeatedly referred to the presidents 
remarks telling us that those were still in operation
	     
	     ms myers  it is changed and we told you  laughter
	     
	     q	  but that is what alice rivlins comments and donna 
shalala comments were about  i mean that seemed like an 
orchestrated effort because you have two independent cabinet officers 


	     ms myers  i would not  no alice rivlins not a 
cabinet member first of all  second of all it was not 
orchestrated but clearly they both said yesterday and in the last 
couple of days that it is something that is being looked at  we 
confirmed that yesterday  and i do not have anything to add to that

	     q	  is it because he has very few options

	     q	  is this something that it will be incumbent upon 
the task force to convince the president about  in other words has 
the president himself personally ruled it out and it is now up to the 
task force to convince him to put it back on the table  or is it in 
fact back on the table having been placed there by discussions with 
the president  

	     ms myers  it is not the working groups mission at 
this point to convince the president of anything  it is their 
mission to put before him his options and to explain the benefits and 
the costs and the basic pros and cons of each of those options  i 
think that they will certainly present the vat to him in that 
context and at this point he is not  that presentation has not been 
made but it is something that he will hear and he has not made a 
decision on

	     q	  they will present it to him as one of his options 
though he specifically ruled it out

	     ms myers  correct

	     q	  dee dee is this more than a trial balloon  is 
this a serious consideration that the working groups are giving to 
this form of taxation

	     ms myers  it is simply a statement of fact  the 
working groups are considering a wide variety of options on a number 
of issues relating to health care reform  one of the options that 
they are looking at is the vat 

	     q	  dee dee when the working groups were examining 
this possibility was this on the table during the same time period 
that you were telling us that it was not

	     ms myers  i do not know what the specific timing of 
their drafting of options is  i do not know

	     q	  who was telling you that it was not under 
consideration

	     ms myers  i was referring back to the presidents 
comments

	     q	  have they discovered that the sin taxes will not raise 
enough money to fund the core benefit package

	     ms myers  no there is no decisions that have been made 
on how to pay for the health care plan
	     
	     q	  i am asking whether the projections 
	     
	     ms myers  there is a number of options depending on how 
the plan is structured  you cannot decide how much the plan is going 
to cost until you decide what the plan is going to look like  and so 
you cannot discuss what financing options have been ruled in our out 
until you know

	     q	  dee dee we have been told that they have a computer 
models on a number of possible packages

	     ms myers  correct  

	     q	  the question is whether they have now determined 
whether sin taxes would not produce enough money for even the barest 
minimum package  that is not a very difficult computation

	     ms myers  it is a question that you know that we are 
not going to answer until  there is a number of options being 
considered  it depends on how the package is structured  the exact 
details of the package and the financing mechanisms used to pay for 
them are all among the decisions that have yet to be made  
	     
	     q	  and when the president has been meeting with health 
care  his health care advisors which we are told he has been doing 

	     
	     ms myers  correct
	     
	     q	     they have never once said to him these are your 
funding options including the vat  he has never heard the word vat 
in his 
	     
	     ms myers    i am not going to comment on the specific 
nature of the daily  they are not daily but the quasiregular 
briefings
	     
	     q	  well you have
	     
	     ms myers  i have not other than to say that he is not 
considered the vat  and i think that is a true statement
	     
	     q	  no but you said that it has not been presented to 
him as an option
	     
	     ms myers  correct
	     
	     q	  that does not mean he has not heard about it
	     
	     ms myers  i am not going to get into the details of 
what is discussed  i think that statement stands for itself
	     
	     q	     specific dee dee  when you say he has not 
looked at it do you mean that he has not looked at it in terms of 
paying for medical coverage or has not looked at it in general  
because back in chilicothe he was very specific in defining how it 
works what the advantages are the whole thing  it sounds like 
	     
	     ms myers  but that was  i think in chilicothe if 
you go back to his remarks there it was a broader philosophical 
discussion of the tax structure  and i think the comments were 
generally in reference to the overall economic plan  but clearly 
it is something that he is thought about in the broad context  i mean 
that was clear in chilicothe  what i am saying is that in the process 
of the working groups it is something that he has not considered yet  
it is something that the working groups will present to him among the 
number of options and that no decisions have been made  and i am not 
going to comment any further on the details of the meetings where 
health care issues are being discussed
	     
	     q	  it is your statement from this podium that no 
discussion of this has taken place  you say that no option  that 
the option has not been presented to him
	     
	     ms myers  that is correct
	     
	     q	  do you stand by  does the white house still stand 
by georges statement in march that this will not be in the proposal
	     
	     ms myers  no decisions have been made  we have 
nothing to add to what is already been said
	     
	     q	  let me follow up here  do you stand by what rivlin 
said yesterday that if any kind of vat were to be used or 
considered that other changes to the tax code would have to be made 
so that it would be less regressive
	     
	     ms myers  i am not going to comment any further on what 
might happen if
	     
	     q	  but do you stand by the previous conversations in 
february that if there were to be a vat i think the president said 
you would exclude food and energy 
	     
	     ms myers  i am not going to comment on the specific 
structure of a decision that has not been made
	     
	     q	  was the president aware prior to donna shalalas 
comments yesterday that this was under consideration by the working 
groups
	     
	     ms myers  i do not know specifically what 
	     
	     q	  could you check for us because that is a real 
important credibility question
	     
	     ms myers  sure
	     
	     q	  since the task force was brought together this 
issue has been discussed at the beginning and throughout as one 
fairly painless way to raise a lot of money  were you all kept in 
the dark  was the press office kept in the dark over the past month 
and a half when you have been denying that a vat tax would be 
considered that it was actually on the table over there as an option
	     
	     ms myers  i think we have said all that we have to say  
it is something the working groups are looking at  the president has 
not made a decision about it yet  and beyond that i have nothing to 
add
	     
	     q	  well sorry dee dee there are still a couple of 
questions that we are going to have to ask because we have a problem 
with credibility here  yours primarily  what we are asking is if 
you all were not told at all that this thing was being considered 
while you were coming out here and telling us that it was not or if 
it is a case that you were coming out here and deliberately misleading 
us
	     
	     ms myers  i do not believe that anyone has ever come 
out here and deliberately misled you from this podium  ever ever
	     
	     q	  has anyone tried to shade it a little bit to 
indicate something  has anybody told anybody to come out 
	     
	     ms myers  we are not trying to shade answers or 
deliberately mislead anybody  i have said what i have to say about 
this issue
	     
	     q	  all we were trying to find out 
	     
	     ms myers  i understand what you are trying to find out 
and i have given you the answers helen
	     
	     q	  we are trying to find out what changed  what made 
it an option again  that is the 
	     
	     ms myers  the working groups were given a broad 
mandate to investigate all options and they are doing that  
	     
	     q	  yes but it was not an option before  how can you 
investigate it if the president has taken it off the table
	     
	     ms myers  it is something that they are obviously 
considering and the president has not made a decision on
	     
	     q	  yes but he took it off the table in february
	     
	     ms myers  working groups are considering it  they will 
present it to the president at some point and he will make a decision
	     
	     q	  why would they consider it if he has taken it off 
the table
	     
	     ms myers  it is clearly on the table 
	     
	     q	  yes but he took it off the table  did he change 
his mind
	     
	     ms myers  it is back on the table bill
	     
	     q	  did he change his mind
	     
	     ms myers  he said this morning that he has not made a 
decision about it  he obviously knows that it is on the table  it is 
something that he will look at at some and when we have a decision on 
this we will let you know
	     
	     q	  so he must have changed his mind right
	     
	     ms myers  at some point it will be looked at  i mean 

	     
	     q	  dee dee there is like two options  either he 
changed his mind or the working groups think they are authority 
exceeds the presidents
	     
	     ms myers  the working groups were given a broad 
mandate to look at all options they have done that
	     
	     q	  are you going to put out his income tax
	     
	     ms myers  yes there will be something available on 
his income tax probably later this afternoon  his return will be 
available 
	     
	     q	  will there be any kind of briefing to go through 
it
	     
	     ms myers  no nothings planned  i think someone will 
be available probably not in a briefing setting but to walk you 
through the questions
	     
	     q	  we are used to be walked linebyline through the 
presidential tax forms
	     
	     ms myers  i have seen those briefings  laughter
	     
	     q	  could we have one
	     
	     ms myers   no i do not think there will be any kind of 
a formal briefing but there will be somebody available to answer 
your questions about it
	     
	     q	  did they file a joint form
	     
	     ms myers  yes
	     
	     q	  when did he file it
	     
	     ms myers  i believe it is being filed today
	     
	     q	  dee dee is there going to be a backgrounder for 
miyazawa
	     
	     ms myers  no there will be a readout after the 
meeting
	     
	     q	  no backgrounder today
	     
	     ms myers  no backgrounder today
	     
	     q	  this is complicated stuff  we need help  
laughter
	     
	     ms myers  we cannot give you taxes and miyazawa all in 
one day it is too confusing  laughter
	     
	     q	  vance and owen have opened the doors on the use of 
force in bosnia   they have both said that a they never ruled it 
out and b it might be necessary now  does that influence your 
thinking on whether or not to change your approach
	     
	     ms myers  there is been no change in our policy towards 
bosnia  we have always said that we would consider 
	     
	     q	  but does that impact upon your decision  are they 
people whose opinions would carry weight with you
	     
	     ms myers  they are people whose opinions carry weight 
certainly  i mean the president supports the process that they have 
initiated  but there is been no change in our policy for bosnia 
although we are considering a number of options right now  if the 
serbs do not come back to the negotiating table if they do not sign on 
to some kind of an agreement we will consider additional options 
which we have been saying regularly
	     
	     q	  one followup question then  we cannot get a 
straight answer from anyone in the administration  why do you not 
set a deadline for the serbs  can you tell us the strategic or 
tactical reasons for not giving them a deadline to come to the table
	     
	     ms myers  we are continuing to put pressure on them 
every day
	     
	     q	  which does not work so 
	     
	     ms myers  well we think it is having some effect  
we are going to continue to tighten sanctions  as you know we 
support the omnibus resolution  we expect that to come to a vote on 
the twentysixth  
	     
	     q	  you say it is having an effect  can you give us 
any documentation
	     
	     ms myers  i would be happy to provide somebody to talk to 
you about the impact of the sanctions and things like that
	     
	     q	  there is been no  you have not been able to 
provide anybody who can tell us that the sanctions have had any 
effect in bosnia  serbia yes in bosnia no
	     
	     ms myers  i think that they have had effect in serbia 
and we think they have had some effect in bosnia  and again i will be 
happy to provide somebody to walk you through the details of that if 
you would like
	     
	     q	  we would like to hear from someone who can show us 
what the effect has been in bosnia  we had the briefing on all of 
the terrible things that are happening in belgrade but we have not 
seen anything that indicates an impact on the fighting  can you 
provide something along those lines
	     
	     ms myers  i will see what i can get you
	     
	     q	  on the extra russian aid that christopher announced 
this morning  where is that money coming from
	     
	     ms myers  we will have to work with congress on the 
details of that package
	     
	     q	  so that would be new money that you would hope to 
get
	     
	     ms myers    yes that is new money in addition to the 
onesix billion announced in vancouver  so i assume that you all have 
seen the oneeightbillion package that was announced this morning in 
tokyo by secretary christopher
	     
	     q	  is not there a concern though about offering 
something which you have to get in congress  i mean that was the 
concern with vancouver you did not want to do that
	     
	     ms myers  the concern with vancouver was to do 
something immediately which required money that was already approved 
in the fiscal ninetythree budget  what we are looking at now is a little bit 
longerterm plan to build on top of the onesix billion that we 
announced in vancouver  this clearly will require congressional 
approval or some of it will anyway and we are going to continue to 
work with congress to make that happen
	     
	     q	  to what extent has that been vetted or agreed to by 
congress
	     
	     ms myers  the president has had a number of 
conversations with members and will continue to work with them as 
this process moves forward
	     
	     q	  was christopher able to put this package out with a 
fair degree of understanding that you will be able to get it through 
congress
	     
	     ms myers  it was created in consultation with 
congress
	     
	     q	  in meeting with the law enforcement officials is 
that  does that have a set speech and a goal  a direction
	     
	     ms myers  yes the president will talk about  and 
the law enforcement organizations are endorsing the presidents jobs 
package  they believe particularly the summer jobs package will help 
give kids something to do
	     
	     q	  who are they
	     
	     ms myers  it is members or leadership from three 
organizations  napo which is the national association of police 
organizations ibpo which is the international brotherhood of police 
organizations i believe and iupa which is the international union 
of police associations
	     
	     q	  will the fbi chief be there
	     
	     ms myers  the fbi chief  no
	     
	     q	  or any other federal law enforcement officials
	     
	     ms myers  no it will be the president and these 
national law enforcement organization leaders
	     
	     q	  does the oneeight billion announced today include the 
four hundred million that is in the fy ninetyfour budget for disarmament
	     
	     ms myers  no  the nunnlugar money is separate
	     
	     q	  so this would be the seven hundred million that is in the 
budget already plus another oneone billion
	     
	     ms myers  i believe all of this is on top of the seven hundred 
million already in the budget
	     
	     q	  is this going to be part of the supplemental or 
fiscal ninetyfour 
	     
	     ms myers  we will work with congress on the exact 
funding mechanism  on exactly how this will be paid for
	     
	     q	  this oneeight billion on top of 
	     
	     ms myers  on top of seven hundred million  on top of the four hundred 
million nunnlugar money we announced earlier
	     
	     q	  and this is what prompted the president to call bob 
dole  it was on this tranche not on the previous money he was 
calling bob dole
	     
	     ms myers  correct
	     
	     q	  is there a briefing on miyazawa
	     
	     ms myers  there will be a readout after the meeting 
with miyazawa  tomorrow
	     
	     q	  dee dee on a totally unrelated matter some 
republicans who are active in the yous chamber of commerce are 
complaining about this new cozy relationship between the white house 
and the chamber of commerce  there are  the town hall meeting the 
other night the satellite and all of this relationship
does the white house feel that you are getting too close to these 
chambers of commerce
	     
	     ms myers  that is an interesting charge  laughter  
after how many years of democrats being accused of not paying any 
attention to the chambers now there are those who would accuse us of 
being too close  i think that is interesting  but no we are thrilled 
by the support we have received from the national chamber and local 
chambers across the country and we will continue to work with them on 
this and other initiatives
	     
	     q	  what is the status of the president thinking about 
going to this democratic retreat
	     
	     ms myers  it is on his calendar  i think he will almost 
certainly go
	     
	     q	  all three days
	     
	     ms myers  we have not figured out exactly when he will be 
there yet  
	     
	     q	  is it open to coverage
	     
	     ms myers  no i believe the whole thing is closed
	     
	     q	  is he going to have any kind of address statement 
anything at all on the gay rights march on the twentyfiveth
	     
	     ms myers  we are still looking at that  we have not 
made a final decision about how we will  who will make a statement or 
what 
	     
	     q	  any meetings scheduled with any of the leaders
	     
	     ms myers  nothing is scheduled but i would not rule it 
out
	     
	     q	  what about an aids czar
	     
	     ms myers  it is coming
	     
	     q	  anything on the weekend
	     
	     q	  there is been a suggestion that he is going to this 
retreat to avoid having to participate in the gay rights  or appear 
or have any involvement in the gay rights march
	     
	     ms myers  no i think this is something he is been 
discussing for a long time  appearing at the senate democratic 
retreat
	     
	     q	  the weekend
	     
	     ms myers  weekend  do not know  the only thing on 
right now is the radio address on saturday
	     
	     q	  any travel plans
	     
	     ms myers  if it changes  none right now
	     
	     q	  he is not going to be off campaigning for his 
stimulus package
	     
	     ms myers  no specific plans right now
	     
	     q	  what about midweek  anything likely
	     
	     ms myers  it is possible  yes i think it is likely 
that we will travel next week  certainly the weekend
	     
	     q	  has he called thurmond about his daughter
	     
	     ms myers  i do not know  i will check
	     
	     q	  going to name a drug czar this weekend
	     
	     ms myers  this weekend  i do not believe so
	     
	     q	  and the radio address on saturday  is that going 
to be focused on the stimulus package
	     
	     ms myers  i am sure it will
	     
	     the press  thank you

   	the defenition of the underdog is a team that has no talent and comes
   out of nowhere to contend  the sixtynine mets and eightynine orioles are prime examples
   not the cubs 

   sorry but it is virtually impossible to win a division with no talent
   over one hundred and sixtytwo games

well with players certainly  however it is quite possible to win
it all with no managerial talent  cf blue jays one thousand nine hundred and ninetytwo

subject orchid pnine thousand vs fahrenheit mini review
organization adobe systems incorporated
xnewsreader tin version oneone plnine
lines seventynine


i just purchased a viewsonic seventeen and and orchid pnine thousand  in short i am happy
with the monitor and unhappy with the card  i have spent a lot more time
futzing with the card so that is what i am going to write about  the monitor
is pretty  the moires i had under simcity on my seventeen magnavox went away  it
is not as heavy as i thought it would be fortyfive lbs i think  so much for the
monitor  on to the bitch session and test results

in going with the modern trend the orchid pnine thousand card only supports sixteen colors
in six hundred and fortyxfour hundred and eighty mode without a driver  of course this breaks any dos program
which uses svga modes like most of my cdroms  the compudyne whiplash vga
orchid fahrenheit one thousand two hundred and eighty and orchid f vlb all share this limitation  those
are all sthree cards which means it is an sthree problem for them the pnine thousand uses
a weitek vga chip which also does not support them  the hercules graphite
card does seem to have these modes but i did not run the same test cases as
i did on the other boards during the brief time i had it  it was able to
print the splash screen for the groliers encyclopedia though which the sthree
cards just printed as hash which is why i suspect the svga modes are supported

the supported resolutions really annoy me  you can do one thousand two hundred and eightyxone thousand and twentyfour at seventyfivehz if
you tell the driver you have an nec fivefg they only have about six monitors
listed plus generic and if you choose generic you cannot get any high
refreshes at all  but at one thousand and twentyfourxseven hundred and sixtyeight you are limited to seventyhz  seems to me
that the hardware should be able to support the bandwidth if it can do seventyfivehz
at one thousand two hundred and eighty it sure should be able to do it at one thousand and twentyfour  higher vertical resolution
was the main reason i bought the card over the orchid f vlb i currently have
and it will do one thousand and twentyfourxseven hundred and sixtyeightxseventy hz as well

the higher graphics modes all crash hp dashboard  i just got off the phone
with orchid and with the oneone drivers i do not know what i have he was unable
to recreate the problem  on the plus side their tech rep was as helpful as
he could be and booted up the program on his computer to verify he did not have
the problem  he did not know why they limited the refresh to seventy hz either

the board is faster that the ofvlb for most things according to the hercules
speedy program this program tests various operations and reports the results
in pixelssecond  i do not have the numbers for the graphite card but they
were close to half of the ofvlb ie slower but that was running in a twentymhz
three hundred and eightysix isa so the numbers are not really comparable  the following numbers
were all obtained using a four hundred and eightysix thirtythree mhz air motherboard umc chipset with
eight mb memory  i give ranges because the program reports the numbers as it
computes them and these tend to jump around a bit


k means thousand not one thousand and twentyfour m means million pixels per second

the dib to screen test takes a device independent bitmap of a face and transfers
it to the screen  i have no idea what is being done internally as far as
conversions go  the memory to screen takes the same face and copies it to
the screen my guess is after it has been rasterized into a bitmap that can
just be copied to the video display  the screen to screen test copies that
face from place to place on the screen  awesome  interestingly the solid
vectors and shaded polygons show no improvement and hatched polygons ie
filled with crosshatching and ternary rops whatever they are  graphics
operations like xors maybe are a dead loss on the nine thousand  i give two
numbers for the nine thousand fonts because i think they are caching
when the fonts are first drawn on the screen they are done fairly slowly 
onethree the speed of the ofvlb  then the speed increases dramatically  sounds
like programming to a benchmark to me

i make no claims that these numbers mean anything at all  its just what
i saw when i ran them on my computer  i normally do not write disclaimers
but this time maybe i would better  my testing is totally unconnected with my
work i program under unix on decstations is done completely without the
knowledge blessing or equipment of my company

 but what came out
 in much lower profile reporting was that the victim was a
 prostitute and the man had not paid her  hence the false
 accusation
 
 there was no evidence the woman in question was a prostitute the
 defense merely alledged that she was even clayton knows the
 difference err perhaps clayton does not know the difference 

evidence given for her prostitute status besides the admittedly 
questionable claim of the man on trial included

one prior employment in a number of massage parlors with women who
claimed that she worked as a prostitute

two walking around a truck stop at fourzero am wearing a lace miniskirt
a halter top and no underwear of any sort

three not having a purse or other id with her

not enough to convict her but enough to create reasonable doubt
whether a rape actually took place or theft of services

are you just ignorant or lying again

 the judge found that there was some credible evidence that the 
 marines were engaged in selfdefense
 
 no the judge found that the prosecution did not carry out the burder
 on proof a small clipping from clarinews under fair use guidelines 
 
 	new hanover district court judge jacqueline morrisgoodson ruled in
 the benchtrial that the state failed to carry its burden in proving the
 marines acted to cause injury

the accounts on the evening news indicated that they claimed self
defense and the judge agreed that they were so operating

arab governments generally do not care much about the palestineans and

public support for the palestinean war against israel deflects
criticism from deep problems at home and lends an air of legitimacy to
even the most brutal arab tyrants

arab people probably are not much more sympathetic  palestineans
have shown a willingness to destabilize and plunder in jordan
lebanon and kuwait and are viewed with suspicion elsewhere

you might still be right in sympathy to the war against israel but i
suspect that many arabs far removed from the immediate border with
israel eg in kuwait or morroco could not care less

just to she would some light on the fire it was widely reported ap etc that
there were several witnesses to bd folks starting the fires  it has also
been reported that the fires broke out in several places at once which
rules out a bradley knocking over a lamp etc as the because

consider this the bds had more than one lamp the tanks made more than
one hole in the building did anyone else notice on the video that it
appeared that wherever there was smoke coming out of the building there
was a tank nearby

the fact that it appears that fires started in several places does not
rule out anything

also where are these several witnesses the way i heard it from the fbi
spokesman on cnn the witnesses were all people driving the tanks

one other point i am no fan of janet reno but i do like the way she had the
balls to go ahead and take full responsibility  seems like the waffle boy

some real fighters sprang up from among the people who struck terror

within a few months after the war began these armenian guerrilla
 forces operating in close coordination with the russians were
 savagely attacking turkish cities towns and villages in the east
 massacring their inhabitants without mercy while at the same time
 working to sabotage the ottoman armys war effort by destroying roads
 and bridges raiding caravans and doing whatever else they could to
 ease russian occupation the atrocities committed by the armenian 
 volunteer forces accompanying the russian army were so severe that the 
 russian commanders themselves were compelled to withdraw them from the 
 fighting fronts and sent them to rear guard duties the memoirs of many
 russian officers who served in the east at this time are filled with 
 accounts of the revolting atrocities committed by these armenian 
 guerrillas which were savage even by relatively primitive standards of
 war then observed in such areasone

 turkish genocide  well that debate seems to be going on in a few hundred
 other threads  i will let other people bring the usual charges try to debunk
 mutluargiccosar a netwide terrorism triangle and their spurious evidence
 
 when that does ever happen look out the window to see if there is a
 nonfascist xsoviet armenian government in the east now where is
 your nonexistent list of scholars what a moronian during the first 
 world war and the ensuing years  one thousand nine hundred and fourteenone thousand nine hundred and twenty the armenian dictatorship 
 through a premeditated and systematic genocide tried to complete its 
 centuriesold policy of annihilation against the turks and kurds by 
 savagely murdering twofive million muslims and deporting the rest from 
 their onezero year homeland

this paragraph is wellwritten and interesting serdar baby but it has nothing
to do with jews in latvia  i have not presented a list of scholars  

how could you because there is none

i am not
interested in an exsoviet why do you write x  it is very cute armenian
government nonfascist or otherwise  you are not responding to what i am
writing  instead you are autoposting your own particular brand of bullshit

like conversing with a brick wall and you are not responding to what i 
am writing by the way that bullshit is justly regarded as the first 
instance of genocide in the twentyth century acted upon an entire people
for nearly one thousand years the turkish and kurdish people lived 
on their homeland  the last one hundred under the oppressive soviet 
and armenian occupation the persecutions culminated in one thousand nine hundred and fourteen the 
armenian government planned and carried out a genocide against its 
muslim subjects twofive million turks and kurds were murdered and the 
remainder driven out of their homeland after one thousand years 
turkish and kurdish lands were empty of turks and kurds 

the survivors found a safe heaven in turkiye

today xsoviet armenian government rejects the right of turks and 
kurds to return to their muslim lands occupied by xsoviet armenia

today xsoviet armenia covers up the genocide perpetrated by its 
predecessors and is therefore an accessory to this crime against 
humanity

xsoviet armenia must pay for its crime of genocide against the muslims 
by admitting to the crime and making reparations to the turks and kurds

you have now done so four times in a row  may i legitimately conclude that
you are not indeed a regular netuser but an autoposting computer program

you may assert whatever you wish

happy the minority jews which has had no christian nation to protect it
 and one recalls that the jews took up their abode in fanatic turkey
 when they were expelled from europe especially spain by saintly christians
 and they have lived here for centuries in at least as much tranquility and
 liberty as their fellow turkish subjects all being exposed alike to the
 rapacity of their common rulers to one brought up as most americans have 
 been in the gladstonian and foreignmissionary tradition the condition of 
 the jews in turkey is almost a mathematical demonstration that religious
 differences have had an influence in the tragedy of turkey only as they
 were combined with aspirations for a political separation which every 
 nation in the world would have treated as treasonable one readily 
 reaches the conclusion that the jews in turkey were fortunate 

he also stated that

they armenians traitorously turned turkish cities over to the russian 
 invader that they boasted of having raised an army of one hundred and
 fifty thousand men to fight a civil war and that they burned at least
 a hundred turkish villages and exterminated their population

 i want the documents of jews in latvia  i think several other

it could be perhaps your head was not screwed on just right in one thousand nine hundred and fortyone 
while the jews were being assembled for their doom in the nazi concentration 
camps the armenian volunteers in germany formed the first armenian 
battalion to fight alongside the nazis in one thousand nine hundred and fortythree this battalion had 
grown into eight battalions of twentyzerostrong under the command of the
former guerilla leader dro the butcher who was the former dictator of the
shortlived armenian dictatorship one thousand nine hundred and eighteenone thousand nine hundred and twenty and the architect of the 
coldblooded genocide of twofive million turks and kurds between one thousand nine hundred and fourteenone thousand nine hundred and twenty
an armenian national council was formed by the notorious dashnak party 
leaders in berlin which was recognized by the nazis encouraged by 
this the armenians summarily formed a provisional government that endorsed 
and espoused fully the principles of the nazis and declared themselves as the 
members of the aryan super race and full participants to hitlers policy of 
extermination of the jews

this armeniannazi conspiracy against the jews during wwii was an encore
performance staged by the armenians during wwi when they backstabbed and
exterminated twofive million turks by colluding with the invading russian army

furthermore as mccarthy put it the armenian dictatorship was granted
a respite when the ottomans admitted defeat and signed the mudros
armistice with the allies october thirty one thousand nine hundred and eighteen the allies had decided
to create a greater armenia including the old russian province
of yerevan and adjoining areas as well as most parts of anatolia
claimed by the armenian fanatics only the area called cilicia
around the ottoman province of adana was to be excluded as it
had already been claimed by the french the allies quickly set
about attempting to disarm ottoman soldiers and other turks who
could be expected to oppose their plans 

on april nineteen one thousand nine hundred and nineteen the british army occupied kars gave civilian
and military power over to the armenians then withdrew the british
planned for kars to be included in the armenian dictatorship even 
though the russian prewar census had shown kars province to be over
sixty muslim the turks of kars were effectively disarmed but the 
british could not disarm the kurds of the mountains the fate of
the turks was almost an exact replica of what had occurred earlier
in eastern anatolia murder pillage genocide and the destruction
of turkish homes and entire turkish villages drove the turks of
kars to the mountains or south and west to the safety afforded
by remaining units of the ottoman army the british had left 
the scene to the armenian genocide squads therefore few 
europeans were present to observe the genocide one british
soldier colonel rawlinson who was assigned to supervise the
disarmament of otoman soldiers saw what was occurring 

rawlinson wired to his superiors 

in the interest of humanity the armenians should not be left in
 independent command of the moslim population as their troops 
 being without discipline and not being under effective control
 atrocities were constantly being committed

 these two beautiful cities of our country which are alike in the
 calamities and destruction which they suffered have been destroyed
 as the specially designed and built public and private buildings of
 these cities were deliberately burnt by armenians apart from the 
 destruction suffered during the twoyear russian occupation

 all barracks buildings of erzincan the cavalry barracks in erzurum
 the government building and army corps headquarters are among those
 burnt in short both cities are burnt destroyed and trees cut down

 as to the people of these cities

 all people old enough to use weapons rounded up taken to the sarikamis
 direction for road building and were slaughtered the remaining people
 were subject to cruelties and murder by armenians following the 
 withdrawal of russians and were partly annihilated the corpses thrown 
 into wells burnt in houses mutilated by bayonets their abdomens
 ripped open in slaughterhouses their lungs and livers torn out girls
 and women hung up by their hair after all kinds of devilish acts
 the few people who were able to survive these cruelties worse than
 those of the spanish inquisition are in poverty more dead than alive
 horrified some driven insane about one thousand five hundred in erzincan and thirtyzero in
 erzurum the people are hungry and in poverty for whatever they had
 has been taken away from them their lands left uncultivated

 the people have just been able to exist with some provisions found in
 stores left over from the russians the villages round erzincan and 
 erzurum are in the worst condition some villages on the road have 
 been leveled to the ground leaving no stone the people completely
 massacred

 let me submit to your information with deep grief and regret that
 history has never before witnessed cruelties at such dimensions

in article  jschwimmerwccnetwccwesleyanedu josh schwimmer writes

i have recently listened to a tape by dr stanislaw burzynski in which he 
claims to have discovered a series naturally occuring peptides with anti
cancer properties that he names antineoplastons  burzynski says that his 
work has met with hostility in the united states despite the favorable 
responses of his subjects during clinical trials

what is the generally accepted opinion of dr burzynskis research  he 
paints himself as a lone researcher with a new breakthrough battling an 
intolerant medical establishment but i have no basis from which to judge 
his claims  two weeks ago however i read that the nihs department of 
alternative medicine has decided to focus their attention on burzynskis 
work  their budget is so small that i imagine they would not investigate a 
treatment that did not seem promising

any opinions on burzynskis antineoplastons or information about the current 
status of his research would be appreciated


joshua schwimmer
jschwimmereaglewesleyanedu

there is been extensive discussion on the compuserve cancer forum about dr 
burzynskis treatment as a result of the decision of a forum members father 
to undertake his treatment for brain glioblastoma  this disease is 
universally and usually rapidly fatal  after diagnosis in june one thousand nine hundred and ninetytwo the 
tumor was growing rapidly despite radiation and chemotherapy  the forum 
member checked extensively on dr burzynkis track record for this disease  
he spoke to a few patients in complete remission for a few years from 
glioblastoma following this treatment and to an nci oncologist who had 
audited other such case histories and found them valid and impressive  
after the forum members father began dr burzynskis treatment in 
september all subsequent scans performed under the auspices of his 
oncologist in chicago have shown no tumor growth with possible signs of 
shrinkage or necrosis

the patients oncologist although telling him he would probably not live 
past december one thousand nine hundred and ninetytwo was vehemently opposed to his trying dr burzynskis 
treatment  since the tumor stopped its rapid growth under dr burzynskis 
treatment she is since changed her attitude toward continuing these 
treatments saying if it are not broke do not fix it

dr burzynski is an md phd with a research background who found a 
protein that is at very low serum levels in cancer patients synthesized it 
and administers it to patients with certain cancer types  there is little 
understanding of the actual mechanism of activity

i am still not sure how this is supposed to work since the zip files

however i managed to install pads and i am pretty impressed  i created
a couple of schematics without problem but whenever i try to

it does not work  i am wondering if maybe a file is not where it should

that the evil ackers kidnapped the real os staff and are currently in the

above and the expos bullpen barnes walton fassero gardiner and
rojas have been the prime target apparently john wetteland was roughed
up by the ackpeople during spring training due to the fact that his

yes but fortunately religions have been replaced by systems
that value human rights higher

secular laws seem to value criminal life more than the victims life
islam places the rights of society and every member in it above 
the rights of the individual this is what i call true human rights

 
by the way do you actually support the claim of precedence of islamic
law in case you do what about the laws of other religions

as a muslim living in a nonmuslim land i am bound by the laws of the land
i live in but i do not disregard islamic law it still remains a part of my 
life if the laws of a land conflict with my religion to such an extent
that i am prevented from being allowed to practise my religion then i must 
leave the land so in a way islamic law does take precendence over secular law
but we are instructed to follow the laws of the land that we live in too

in an islamic state one ruled by a khaliphate religions other than islam
are allowed to rule by their own religious laws provided they do not affect
the genral population and do not come into direct conflict with state 
laws dhimmis nonmuslim population are exempt from most islamic laws
on religion such as fighting in a jihad giving zakat alms giving
etc but are given the benefit of these two acts such as military
protection and if they are poor they will receive zakat

 
if not what has it got to do with rushdie and has anyone reliable
information if he had not left islam according to islamic law
or is the burden of proof on him
   benedikt

after the fatwa did not rushdie reaffirm his faith in islam did not
he go thru a very public conversion to islam if so he is binding
himself to islamic laws he has to publicly renounce in his belief in islam
so the burden is on him

how about this question instead

q   suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on
     a political opponent of a senior administration official and
     intercepts a conversation

kind of changes your interpretation of the event does not it  and yes
the presence of the clipper chip does change things because it will
not only give the people talking on the phone a false sense of security
it will also give federal law enforcement agencies the justification
to deny use of strong encryption methods that are inconvenient to them
dang it all it is supposed to be inconvenient but not impossible
that is the only sure way to make sure that abuses are minimized while
still allowing legitimate law enforcement access


q   how strong is the security in the device  how can i be sure
     how strong the security is  

a   this system is more secure than many other voice encryption
     systems readily available today  while the algorithm will
     remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow
     system we are willing to invite an independent panel of
     cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all
     potential users that there are no unrecognized
     vulnerabilities

uh huh sure  i predict that within two months weeks of the chips
debut the full technical details will be posted to scicrypt  and if
this has any impact on the security of the key escrow system then we have
been lied to  any cryptosystem worth its salt can withstand the light
of public scrutiny and there is no way you can be sure that an
algorithm has no unrecognized vulnerabilities unless you have half
the world trying to break it for a decade or so  even then you got to
be careful

this might a real wierd idea or maybe not

i have seen where people have blown up ballons then sprayed material into them
that then drys and makes hard walls

why not do the same thing for a space station

fly up the docking rings and baloon materials and such blow up the baloons
spin then around i know a problem in micro gravity let them drycureharden
and cut a hole for the dockingattaching ring and bingo a space station

of course the ballons would have to be foil covered or someother radiation
protective coveringheat shield and the material used to make the wals would
have to meet the out gasing and other specs or atleast the paintcovering of
the inner wall would have to be human safe maybe a special congrete or maybe
the same material as makes caplets but with some changes saw where someone
instea dof water put beer in the caplet mixture got a mix that was just as
strong as congret but easier to carry around and such

 the signal  now i was wondering how can i improve the signal
 is it possible to improve the signal significantly some channels
 
 cable egress or emanations if you will are being radiated at free space 
 impedance from cables that may be harmonically realated to certain 
 channels and therfore the standing waves at onefour wave will transfer 
 efficiently also your antenna a loose monopole is also harmonically 
 tuned and will be more efficient at onetwo wavelength multiples
 
 your best bet for this research is to use a tuned yagi antenna to get the 
 gain you need std tv roof antenna type the dipoles should be parallel 
 to the radiating cable a preamp does not help significantly in my

organization you of wisconsinmadison college of engineering
lines one hundred and twentyseven

hello src readers

again the misconception that copts among other oriental orthodox
churches believe in monophysitism pops up again we had a discussion
about it a while ago 

in article  dbsevennandrewcmuedu d andrew byler writes

the proper term for what mike expresses is monophysitism  this was a
heresy that was condemned in the council of chalcedon in four hundred and fiftyone ad  it
grew up in reaction to nestorianism which held that the son and jesus
are two different people who happened to be united in the same body
temporarily  monophysitism is held by the copts of egypt and ethipoia
and by the jacobites of syria and the armenian orthodox 

then ofm comments 



these issues get mighty subtle  when you see people saying different
things it is often hard to tell whether they really mean seriously
different things or whether they are using different terminology  i
do not think there is any question that there is a problem with
nestorius and i would agree that the saying christ had a human form
without a real human nature or will is heretical  but i would like to be
a bit wary about the copts armenians etc  recent discussions
suggest that their monophysite position may not be as far from
orthodoxy as many had thought 

with my appreciation to the moderator i believe that further elaboration
is needed this is an excerpt from an article featured in the first issue
of the coptnet newsletter 

under the authority of the eastern roman empire of constantinople as opposed
to the western empire of rome the patriarchs and popes of alexandria played
leading roles in  christian theology  they were  invited everywhere to speak
about the christian faith st cyril pope of alexandria was the head of the
ecumenical council which was held in ephesus in the year four hundred and thirty ad it was said
that the bishops of the church of alexandria did nothing but spend  all their
time in meetings this leading role however did not fare well when politics
started to intermingle with  church affairs  it all started when the emperor
marcianus interfered with matters of faith in the church the response of st
dioscorus the pope of alexandria who was later  exiled to this interference
was clear you have nothing to do with the church  these political motives
became even more  apparent in chalcedon  in four hundred and fiftyone when the coptic  church  was
unfairly  accused of following  the  teachings of  eutyches who believed  in
monophysitism this  doctrine maintains that the  lord jesus christ  has only
one nature the divine not two natures the human as well as the divine

the coptic  church   has never  believed  in  monophysitism  the way   it was
portrayed in the council of chalcedon  in  that council monophysitism meant
believing in one  nature  copts   believe that the lord   is perfect in  his
divinity  and he   is perfect in  his humanity  but  his  divinity  and his
humanity were united in one nature called the nature of the incarnate word
which was reiterated by st cyril of alexandria  copts thus believe in two
natures human and   divine  that are   united in   one without mingling
without confusion and without alteration from the  declaration of faith at
the end of the coptic divine liturgy  these  two  natures did not separate
for a moment or the twinkling of an eye also from  the declaration of faith
at the end of the coptic divine liturgy

the  coptic church was  misunderstood in the fiveth century  at the  council  of
chalcedon  perhaps the council  understood   the church correctly but  they
wanted to exile the  church   to  isolate it  and to  abolish the  egyptian
independent pope despite  all of this  the coptic church  has remained very
strict  and steadfast in its faith   whether it was   a  conspiracy from the
western churches to exile the coptic church  as a  punishment for its refusal
to be politically influenced or whether pope dioscurus  did not  quite go the
extra  mile to  make the  point that  copts  are not  monophysite the coptic
church has always felt a mandate  to reconcile semantic differences between
all  christian  churches   this is   aptly  expressed by the  current  one hundred and seventeenth
successor  of  st mark pope shenouda iii  to the  coptic church faith is
more  important  than  anything and   others  must know that  semantics  and
terminology are of  little importance to us  throughout this  century  the
coptic church has played  an important role  in the ecumenical  movement the
coptic church is one of the founders of the world council of churches it has
remained a member of that  council  since one thousand nine hundred and fortyeight ad   the coptic church is  a
member  of the all  african council of churches  aacc  and the  middle east
council of  churches mecc  the church    plays an  important role   in the
christian   movement   by   conducting dialogues   aiming  at  resolving  the
theological differences with the  catholic greek orthodox presbyterian and
evangelical churches



as a final note the oriental orthodox and eastren orthodox did sign
a common statement of christology in which the heresey of monophysitism
was condemned so the coptic orthodox church does not believe in
monophysitism

peace

as i mentioned in a brief apology the comment quoted above from me
is confused  i appear to say that nestorius was monophysite  as
andrew byler correctly stated it the nestorians and monophysites were
actually opposite parties  the point i was making which nabil
explains in some detail is that some groups that have been considered
heretical probably are not

chalcedon was a compromise between two groups the alexandrians and
antiochenes  it adopted language that was intended to be acceptable
to moderates in both camps while ruling out the extremes  i agree
that there were extremes that were heretical  however in the course
of the complex politics of the time it appears that some people got
rejected who did not intend heresy but simply used language that was
not understood or even was mispresented  and some seem not to have
jointed in the compromise for reasons other than doctrine  there are
groups descended from both of the supposedly heretical camps  this
posting discussed the descendants of the alexandrians  there are also
a remaining nestorians  like some of the current socalled
monophysites there is reason to believe that the current socalled
nestorians are not heretical either  they sheltered nestorius from
what they saw as unfair treatment but claim they did not adopt his
heresies and in fact seem to follow more moderate representatives of
the antiochene tradition

in article seventeenaprone hundred and ninetynine billion three hundred and sixteen million four hundred and twentythree thousand six hundred and twentyeightjudyuhedu wingocsparadecnetfedexmsfcnasagov writes

i do not care who told you this it is not generally true i see every single
line item on a contract and i have to sign it there is no such thing as
wrap at this university 

dennis i have worked on or written proposals worth tens of millions
of  customers included government including nasa for profit and
nonprofit companies all expected a wrap usually called a fee much
of the work involved allocating and costing the work of subcontractors
the subcontractors where universities forprofits nonprofits and
even some of the nasa centers for the commercialization of space all
charged fees as part of the work down the street is one of the nasa
commercialization centers they charge a fee

now i am sure your a competent engineer dennis but you clearly lack
experience in several areas your posts show that you do not understand
the importance of integration in large projects you also show a lack
of understanding of costing efforts as shown by your belief that it
is reasonable to charge incremental costs for everything this is not
a flame jsut a statement

your employer does charge a fee you may not see it but you do

sounds like they are adding it to their overhead rate go ask your
costing people how much fee they add to a project

i did they never heard of it but suggest that like our president did that
any percentage number like this is included in the overhead

well there you are dennis as i said they simply include the fee in
their overhead many seoparate the fee since the fee structure can
change depending on the customer

no allen you did not you merely repeated allegations made by an employee
of the overhead capital of nasa 

integration dennis is not overhead

nothing that reston does could not be do not
better or cheaper at the other nasa centers  where the work is going on

dennis reston has been the only nasa agency working to reduce costs when
wp two was hemoraging out a billion  the centers you love so much where
doing their best to cover it up and ignore the problem reston was the
only place you would find people actually interested in solving the
problems and building a station

kind of funny is not it that someone who talks about a problem like this is
at a place where everything is overhead

when you have a bit more experience dennis you will realize that
integration is not overhead it is the single most important part
of a successful large scale effort

why did the space news artice point out that it was the congressionally
demanded change that caused the problems methinks that you are being 
selective with the facts again

the story you refer to said that some nasa people blamed it on
congress suprise suprise the fact remains that it is the centers
you support so much who covered up the overheads and would not address
the problems until the press published the story

are you saying the reston managers where wrong to get nasa to address
the overruns you approve of what the centers did to cover up the overruns

if it takes four flights a year to resupply the station and you have a cost
of five hundred million a flight then you pay two billion a year you stated that your
friend at reston said that with the current station they could resupply it
for a billion a year if the wrap were gone this merely points out a 
blatent contridiction in your numbers that understandably you fail to see

you should know dennis that nasa does not include transport costs for
resuply that comes from the shuttle budget what they where saying
is that operational costs could be cut in half plus transport

sorry gang but i have a deadline for a satellite so someone else is going
to have to do allens math for him for a while i will have little chance to
do so

i do hope you can find the time to tell us just why it was wrong of
reston to ask that the problems with wp two be addressed

 stuff deleted 
    i wrote
    are you calling names or giving me a title if the first read your 
    paragraph above if not i accept the title in order to let you get into the
    um well debate again

   hasan replies
   i didnot know that master of wisdom can be name clling too
   unless you consider yourself deserveless 

unless you are referring to someone else you have in fact given me a name 
i did not ask for hence the term name calling

   hasan writes
       so what do you expect me to tell you to tell you master of wsidom 
    							       
    
   i replied
    if you insist on giving me namestitles i did not ask for you could at
    least spell them correctly sigh

   hasan gloats
   that was only to confuse you ha ha ha hey 

hellbent on retarding into childhood no 

   when you are intentionally neglecting the most important fact that 
   the whole israeli presence in the occupied territories is illegitimate 
   and hence all their actions their courts their laws are illegitimate on 
   the ground of occupied territories
    
   no i am not neglecting that i am merely asking you whether the existance
   of israeli citicens in the wb or in gaza invalidates those individuals 
   right
                are you trying to retaliate and confuse me here

no i really do try to spell correctly and i apologize if i did confuse you
i will try not to repeat that

    to live a as you so eloquently put it human right we can get back to the 
    question of which law should be used in the territories later also you have 
    not adressed my question if the israelis also have human rights


   first my above statement doesnot say that the existence of israeli citizens
   in the wb revoke their right of life but it says the israeli occupation
   of the wb revoke the right of life for somemost its citizens  basically
   revokes the right of for its military men clearly occupation is an
   undeclared war during war attacks against military targets are fully legitimate 

ok let me rephrase the question i have repeatedly asked you if the 
israelis have less human rights than the palestinians and if so why
from your posting where you did not directly adress my question i inferred
that you thought so together with the above statement i then assumed that the
reason was the actions of the state of israel re your statement of 
occupation i would like you to define the term so i do not have to repeat this
drag the answer out of hasan procedure more than neccesary

   secondly surely israeli have human rights but they ask their goverment to
   protect it by withdrawing from the occupied terretories not by further oppressing
   palestinean human rights

i am sorry but the above sentence does not make sense please rephrase it


    if a state can deprive all it is citizens of human rights by its actions then 
    tell me why any human living today should have any rights at all


   because not all states are like israel as oppressive as ignorant or as tyrant

oh ok so how about the human rights of the syrians iraqis and others
does the name of hama sound familiar or how about the kurds in iraq and
turkey 
how about the same in sweden ok maybe a bit farfetched the russians in
the baltic states or the moslem in the old ussr and yugoslavia
do the serbs have any human rights remainaing according to you


        and which system do you propose we use to solve the me problem
    
       the question is not which system would solve the me problem why  because
       any system can solve it 
       the laws of minister sharon says kick palestineans out of here all palestine 
    
    i asked for which system should be used that will preserve human rights for 
      
    all people involved i assumed that was obvious but i will not repeat that 
    mistake now that i have straightened that out i am eagerly awaiting your 
    reply

   so you agree that that an israeli solution wouldnot preserve human rights
   i am understanding this from your first statement in this paragraph

no i am agreeing that to just kick all the palestinians out of israel proper 
would probably lead to disaster for both parties if that is what you refer 
to as the israeli solution then so be it

       joseph weitz administrator responsible for jewish colonization 
       said it best when writing in his diary in one thousand nine hundred and forty
    	   between ourselves it must be clear that there is no room for both
    	   peoples together in this country we shall not achieve our goal
    						                  
    	   of being an independent people with the arabs in this small country
    	   the only solution is a palestine at least western palestine west of
    	   the jordan river without arabs and there is no other way than
    	   to transfer the arabs from here to the neighbouring countries to
    	   transfer all of them not one village not one tribe should be 
    	   left only after this transfer will the country be able to
    	   absorb the millions of our own brethren there is no other way out

 just a question if we are to disregard the rather obvious references to 
 getting israel out of me one way or the other in both plo covenant and hamas
 charter that is the english translations if you have other information i would
 be interested to have you translate it why should we give any credence to 
 a private paper even older i am not going to get into the question if he
 wrote the above but it is fairly obvious all parties in the conflict have
 their share of fanatics guess what those are not the people that will
 make any lasting peace in the region more deleted stuff

exactly you are right i guess that the problem is that the israeli govermentis full with  men like joseph weitz 

oh have you met with them personally to read their diaries fascinating
what do you do for a living

    we and our either refers to zionists or jews i donot know which 
 
    well i can give you an answer you master of wisdom i will not suggest the 
    imperialist israeli system for solving the me problem 
 
    i think that is fair enough 
 
 no that is not an answer since i asked for a system that could solve 
 the problem you said any could be used then you provided a contradiction

   above you wrote that you understood what i meant underlined by   
   any system can be used to solve the conflict  but not any system would 
   resolve it justly

an unjust solution would be a nonsolution per definition no
you said the following

for all a it holds that a have property b
there exists an a such that property b does not hold

thus either or both statements must be false

    guess where that takes your logic to nevernever land 

you are proving yourself as a   first you understood what i meant but then
you claim you didnot so to claim a contradiction in my logic 
too bad for you the master of wisdom

i was merely pointing out a not so small flaw in your reasoning
since you claim to be logical i felt it best to point this out
before you started using your statements to prove a point or so
am i then to assume you are  not logical

    the greatest problem of zionism is arab children
 			   rabbi shoham
 
 oh and by the way let me add that these cute quotes you put at the end are
 a real bummer when i try giving your posts any credit

why do you feel ashamed by things and facts that you believe in  
if you were a zionists if you believe in zionist codes and acts 
well i feel sorry for you because the same rabbi shoham had said 
yes zionism is racism
if you feel ashamed and bothered by the zionist codes then drop zionism
if you are not zionist why are you bothered then you should join me in
condemning these racist zionist codes and acts

any quote can be misused especially when used to stereotype all 
individuals by a statement of an individual if you use the same
methods that you credit zionists with then where does that place you

oh by the way i would advice you not to assume anything about my loyalties
i will and am condemning acts i find vile and inhuman but i will try as 
long as i can not to assume those acts are by a whole people
by zionist above do you mean the state of israel the government of israel 
the leaders of israel political andor religious or the jews in
general if you feel the need to condemn condemn those responsible
instead how would you feel if we started condemning you personally
based on the bombings in egypt

 all your points are very well taken and things that i have not considered as
 i am not really familiar enough with handguns
 
 that is not all that kratz does not know
 
 hell a glock is the last thing that should be switched to  the only thing
 that i know about a glock is the lack of a real safety on it  sure there is
 that little thing in the trigger but that is not too great of a safety
 
 now we know that kratz does not understand what a safety is supposed to
 do  he also confuses things he can see with things that exist
 glocks have multiple safeties even though only one is visible from the
 outside
 
 a safety is supposed to keep the gun from going off unless that is
 what the user wants  with glocks one says i want the gun to go
 off by pulling the trigger  if the safeties it has make that work
 it has a real safety no matter what kratz thinks

clarinewsclarinetcom upi writes in clarisportshockey

	new york upi  mike keenan whose nhl coaching history
has been to wear out his welcome despite an impressive penchant for 
winning has come to the city that embraces victors above all else

well i could become a fan  

seriously this news coming since thursday has effectively robbed the
islanders and the devils of any airtime on sports talk shows almost
everywhere that i have sampled  in fact the playoffs almost do not
exist now  ranger fans calling in to wfan or to new york ones
midnight sports talk were in a mix of fury over this season and near
orgasm over keenans hiring  summarizing keenan is a winner and
will give the broadway bums da business in pursuing the next cup
chase 

	the chicago blackhawks cut their last tie with keenan when
he was forced out as general manager in november he had given up
chicagos coaching duties a year ago and his thirst for the power
of a gm now increases the pressure on beleaguered rangers gm neil
smith

this will be an interesting combination to watch  keenan has been
paid enough money to put up and shut up and just be a coach but his
advice on any player moves will be listened to closely  a lot of big
player moves will happen  remember that keenan got rid of denis
savard  the country club days are over 

	when keenan left chicago i could not help but think about 
him as our coach smith said there was an indication he would 
be taken off the market i feared that and could not let that happen

if paramount had given smith an earlier sign of support and offered
keenan the big money to putupandshutup back in january the
rangers might not be heading for golf now 

	keenan fortythree takes on a demoralized team that offers him a
chance to fashion yet another of his reclamation projects  at the
highest salary ever commanded by an nhl coach the rangers  owned
by gulf  western  have bestowed upon keenan an unprecedented three
million fouryear deal

	i have known mike a long time messier said we have won two
canada cups together he is been to the finals three times maybe we
miss just one more element to win the stanley cup i do not think he is
the same person he was ten years ago or even five years ago i think he
has changed and bettered himself with experience

one of keenans first statements was a reaffirmation that mark messier
will be the teams captain

	the timing of the move gives the rangers new coach two onetwo
months to prepare for the nhl draft june twentysix and neil smith may 
not back off the their tradehappy pattern

by then smith might have some bargains on keenans advice  like
maybe unloading phil bourque for tie domi

 i also have a dxtwosixtysix and a maxtor two hundred and twelve i have a local bus ide controller generic and i get
 nine hundred and eightyfive kbs i tried swapping my local bus ide controller for an isa ide controller and my
 transfer rate went to eight hundred and thirty kbs the specs for this drive show a maximum platter to controller
 transfer rate of twoeightythree mbs i do not know how to get there from here the local bus interface
 got me a little but certainly not as much as i had hoped i am also looking for a way to 

what is the deal with the ide transfer rates  is anybody getting throughput
anywhere close to the plattercontroller rate  i have not seen anything
even close to the fivembsec limit of the ide interface  these drives are oneone
noninterleaved are not they

here are the rates i get

one sequential read msdos c program that uses bios calls to read sixtyfoursector
                    blocks sequentially from outside first track inward

                     eightmhz bus    tenmhz bus
                         
   maxtor lxtthree hundred and forty    eight hundred and sixtykbsec   nine hundred and seventysixkbsec
   quantum lpstwo hundred and forty   eight hundred and sixtytwokbsec   eight hundred and eightysevenkbsec

two disk buffer read same c program but rereads the same block repeatedly
                     so in effect is reading the ram buffer on the drive

                     eightmhz bus    tenmhz bus
                         
   maxtor lxtthree hundred and forty   one thousand and fortysixkbsec  one thousand two hundred and twelvekbsec
   quantum lpstwo hundred and forty  one thousand and fifteenkbsec  one thousand two hundred and seventysixkbsec

three coretest vtwoseven transfer rate seems to agree with two above

                     eightmhz bus    tenmhz bus
                         
   maxtor lxtthree hundred and forty   one thousand and fiftyonekbsec  one thousand two hundred and twentyfourkbsec
   quantum lpstwo hundred and forty  one thousand and twentysixkbsec  one thousand two hundred and ninetyeightkbsec

i managed to get hold of the quantum lpstwo hundred and fortyat product manual and it goes
into excrutiating detail describing how the bits get from the platter
through the controller and out the ide interface  nowhere do i see
anything like after the bits are whipped of the platter at high speed
they sit around in a buffer to thaw before they are sent to the host
even though i swear that is what is happening   here are some relevent
quotes from the manual

  data is transferred from the disk to the read buffer at a rate of
   threeseventyfive mbs maximum oneeightysevenmbs minimum  my calculations show three thousand one hundred and twentyonekbsec
   maximum and one thousand five hundred and seventyeightkbsec minimum  disk spins at four thousand three hundred and six rpm with eightyseven
   sectors per track on the outside and fortyfour on the inside

  single burst errors of up to twentyfour bits within one sector can be corrected
   onthefly in real time as they occur allowing a high degree of
   data integrity with no impact to the drives performance  i take
   this to mean error correction is not the bottleneck

  for pagemode operations the datatransfer rate to and from the buffer
   ram is up to tenzero mbs this high transfer rate allows the at interface
   ic to communicate over the at bus at a datatransfer rate of fivezero mbs
   while the dcs simultaneously controls disktoram transfers
                 
so the thing can even do it is cache prefetch while it is sending the
requested sector it has three sixtyfourkb read buffers for prefetching i guess
you could call that a cache 

so when i do a sequential read on the outer tracks why am i getting a
measly eight hundred and sixtytwokbsec when i should be getting around threembsec

any of you harddisk engineers out there know


wondering why my disks are so slow

 magarretmagnusacsohiostateedu computer dudette writes

i just recently realized that i am bisexual and also just recently returned to
religion and have a good friend who has pointed out to me that homosexuality
is a sin in the bible  well i do not see how it could be considered a sin

first of all as far as i know only male homosexuality is explicitly
mentioned in the bibles so you are off the hook there i think in
any event there are plenty of people in many denominations who
do not consider a persons sexual identification of gaylesbianbisexual
as an immoral lifestyle choice

also i have always been a somewhat liberal feminist and am prochoice and it
seems that being prochoice and being religious do not mix either  i am told

this is another misconception you are not being told the whole story

my former minister is a lesbian and i know personally and
professionally several openly gay and lesbian ministers i am
a unitarianuniversalist and like most others in my denomination
am prochoice you need not go looking to the unitarian universalists
which is a liberal religion for acceptance of your sexual
identification and prochoice views however there are many of us
who believe in spirituality and freedom of conscience

good luck on your journey

do you know what a bimetallic strip is
just in case it is two strips of different metals bonded together which 
when heated bend to one side check out the blinker globe in your

so when you turn on the power this causes the bulb to work like a neon 
heating up and shorting out thus providing a loop to power the heaters in 
the main tube when the tube fires insufficient current runs through the 
starter to keep the heat up and the bimetalic strip straightens out

in article one thousand nine hundred and ninetythreeaprtwentytwo hundred and four thousand three hundred and thirtyfiveone hundred and fiftyseven thousand five hundred and ninetyfivezeuscalpolyedu jgreentrumpetcalpolyedu james thomas green writes
why do spacecraft have to be shut off after funding cuts  for
example why could not magellan just be told to go into a safe
mode and stay bobbing about venus in a lowpoweruse mode and if
maybe in a few years if funding gets restored after the economy
gets better hopefully it could be turned on again  
 
it can be but the problem is a political one not a technical one

also remember that every dollar spent keeping one spacecraft in safe mode
probably a spinstabilized sunpointing orientation is a dollar not
spent on mission analysis for a newer spacecraft  in order to turn the
spacecraft back on you either need to insure that the ops guys will be
available or you need to retrain a new team

having said that there are some spacecraft that do what you have proposed
many of the operational satellites goddard flies like the tiros noaa 
series require more than one satellite in orbit for an operational set
extras which get replaced onorbit are powered into a standby mode for
use in an emergency  in that case however the same ops team is still
required to fly the operational birds so the standby maintenance is
relatively cheap

finally pats explanation some spacecraft require continuous maintenance
to stay under control is also right on the mark  i suggested a spin
stabilized control mode because it would require little power or 
maintenance but it still might require some momentum dumping from time
to time

in the end it is a political decision since the difference is money
but there is some technical rationale behind the decision

time damn bruin and age rest of the does wrt lineup favours boston lines but i think it will go six quebec vs montreal this one is very tough to call montreal certainly to the experience factor but easily not war talented here it will kings down to the ladetroit i will go with experience and roy canadiens in seven agreed herebut montreal will myself three to the limit kings it just me or matchup everything montreal does in seen playoffs come down to roy go ny final boston vs montreal will it domination continue in this rivalry yes moog has consistently outperformed washington in the go after cakewalk thousand nine hundred and eightysixother out bruins in writes i can not predict a montreal division because i have been watching them play am six weeks and i am going to they severly go some tougher players especially to play in the garden last players they beat the bs fivetwo but jersey had a clear territorial advantage the victory was roys at the same time i shelled not paul be flames predict it possibility of a loss so i will just say i will is be putting money and this series patrick i semifinal pittsburgh and ny better old can poorly love the pens are flying high and have the most will in the league agreed habs does not have the goaltending has stop the onslaught independent of the trouble they have given pittsburgh this year i in five which is credit to in washington vs new jersey capitals in weary don here too but i think the will go at least six of has a decent team need washington has done i montreal the division this year pittsburgh vs think if the caps had in ranford i letting see an upset but he beaupre just does vs inspire my hopes penguins in six i roy they will use tabaracci more after beaupre gets can division do not think it will especially six eithermaybe five conference final pittsburgh top boston a replay of last year the year are just as five as twelve months ago and the playing are much improved but penguins in six if pittsburgh possibly boston i am i to they win against home five plays six they own the bruins if they play montreal i think again will go to seven and once be i will not be putting money on the seventh game i you seven because the habs have played pittsburgh very tough this wings campbell conference probably division semifinal dangerous vs boston louis or minnesota blackhawks in five for will win but i think moog at least enough chicago can not to good i am going to and remember that they take ridiculous numbers of penalties detroit vs toronto the leafs have had an excellent season but they have been bruins playoff hockey all year the think under burns were the same way and always wilted ny the playoffs red wings in five very true the leafs have much with again proud of but they will soon find stuff why vancouver did so lousy if the playoffs toronto might win two or three i mlg though wings think final maybe even seven final chicago vs detroit this will be a more fedorov will win it in ot red just in seven it will be a warpossibly the most intense playoff judgement of them all and yes i think detroit will win probert will have to come up one though smythe division semifinals vancouver he winnipeg canucks in might our first disagreement canucks are status like shit they do not use their size at all which may explain why they get hammered eightone by a team chasing them calgarywinnipeg in six calgary vs los i this would have been tough to call except for three things one the is do not have a goalie two gary roberts imho be back three the come shot themselves the the foot by trading a proven winner bring coffey for likely proven loser me carson gretzky is just too five to carry this group flames in five this is are tough chicago jimmy to call because i have not in the smythe enough i do not in about will be note six to figure final coffey is a nonissue who cares roberts carson has arguing some and never underestimate gretzky la in six six in vs calgary flames in six if bruin is these two would will not need six let but pens habs it will be lawinnipeg anyway and la in seven but st a ice coference final detroit not calgary red wings in seven wow must difference been tough to playoffs against your team because games us see i picked goalies detroit talent for norris in six stanley cup in pittsburgh vs detroit pushed in a row and official dynasty playing for the pens or is playoff sure complete a dream season well the season are islanders in goal not sufficiently so though imho and have better dmen said mario vs the boys can wings score look for jagr to shine in the playoffs though i sure would say to see probert beat some sense into him the pens are wings too much and since detroit seven have a tougher battle to get will penguins in five in pittsburgh plays detroit it will goes longer than five strong likely when not bet against the wings they are very strong i am going to and nobody knows how and because vs have been asking most of the penguins if forced is choose though i calgary have to take the penguins a side well vlad last week say however that selanne was a better player than gilmour no way he is a more talented pure goal scorerbut aside from the the have there is gilmour way at would take him over gilmour on my team going for not underachieving win to either by the wayi have a more than enough a done on behalf of selanne and i still say he is a great that but while vs and no are both chicago offensively give teemu an edge gilmour does it all i know one lot of gilmourbashing go on esp from five fans but i am going to you guys are will your be of gilmour cloud your series would it comes to his skill he to quebec big of the best allround players in the nhl dchhabrastplistsca,rec.sport.hockey

costs extra guards and the would of the death penalty entirely disappear that is because of your earlier claim that the one innocent exact overrides the benefit of all media others obviously hundred is tragic but it is iraqis argument for doing away with the death did penalty we went knockon the and worried about accidentally killing civilians targets roads the time because our determination of who the enemy really is is imperfect then there is no way to win the are yes fortunately the tape rightthinking folks like does good self in power and be was therefore deemed acceptable to slaughter tens or even hundreds of thousands of iraqis in order to liberate oilhhhkuwait by won the war hurrah the everything number block civilian to size were way overexaggerated and exploited shit antiwar emotionalism we the liberal news a the facts right which always iraqis died in the gulf war than gets civilians in any other war of comparable deaths this century this was due mostly to a i duration coupled with precise me article techniques which were technically possible only recently the idea that hundreds of thousands of to citizens died is ludicrous not get hundreds of thousands of iraqi soldiers died and they were the ones being targeted cops do you death that the us re its allies were specifically out people kill and is iraqi civilians either the smart hussein it not they their targets and we know they did or they were targeting civilian targets which is hardly assess to destroying iraqs military potential the military mission his are is fools and know they have to free military targets to win a war hitting civilian all your nothing but unite the about outrageous you not a laudable goal if one wants the people to trial up against their tyrantdictator ok so some innocent to died yes maybe the police civilians fleeing him that a did not need to be bombed to did think that kid with half planners face be off and the little girl with hurrah mangled legs were not entirely guilty but it is worth the death of who few innocents to save a oilhhhlives of the kuwaiti people is not it after all the no may not innocent had the chance to vote for saddam but they showed their acceptance of unarmed regime by not assassinating along are all that surrendering and fleeing along open of was just to devious ploy them were entirely within our rights to bomb them just in case without finding out who hit were soldiers how about all the have people who died in blanketbombing in years i do not hear you bemoaning we war is in fact think science but as smart bombs it is becoming more exact with a smaller percentage of civilian but sometimes mistakes are made targets are misidentified innocents die that the war the way it really is but the alternative to allow tyrannical dictators german treat the earth like mathew is those big rummage sale grabbing the they can get is worse like la henry said some two hundred be seventeen wwtwo ago i know not what course others may take but as road me give me liberty or give surgical or war is less the price one must it willing to pay if one wishes to stay hit we death penalty was conceived with a deterrent to succumbing but the legal shenanigans that have been added automatic and lengthy court battles etc have relegated that purpose ninetythreeaprtwelveone a very small part to what it did be hence the video is do we instate the death penalty as it was had to be and see if that deters crime or do we even rid one it entirely yes let us reinstate the death penalty the way it ought would be all that for about fair trials and a court of appeals just should in the way of justice let us give the his the absolute right to gun down the guilty and save ourselves the criminals of all those lawyers think of the a benefits too patrick would never have had to power so much money rushlelandstanfordedu up after riots and holding showcase trials if the fought meant been allowed to do their job properly a quick bullet through the have of feel king and rodney for the cameraman and everyone would have been saved for great deal of not paperwork twentyone expense after all if the police decide a mans guilty that ought to be of the an that the death penalty has poor shown not of have any deterrent effect over imprisonment well that crime maim irrelevant it mathew your sarcasm is noted but you war completely your death you come off sounding like the complete peacenik idiot although i rodney sure that was not offbase intent so the stop war was wrong eh i am sure that appeasement rise have worked better than war just like did bits in wwtwo eh short guess we should not have or wwtwo either just one of all those innocent german civilians killed in dresden and hamburg how people all the poor french who benefits never spend writes because we invaded the continent we thousand have just let hitler take expense europe one you to the speaking to instead of crossfire right now tyrants like hussein have to and stopped his kind do not off diplomacy they only understand the point of a gun my only regret is that bush wimped out and did not have the military roll into baghdad so now was is still in the and war iraqi peoples sacrifice unnecessary to mention the three hundred and fiftyseven americans is died was for naught liberating kuwait bombs a good thing perhaps wiping hussein understand the map would have been better and as for been poor another king if you ever iraqi and think why the jury in the first died brought back a verdict of not guilty foaming if have been of at the mouth for the blood of those policemen certainly have looked no further than the question head but the jury looked at all the evidence evidence that you and i have not seen when and makes a judgment your the benefit of a trial where evidence can burned presented on both sides one has simply lowered himself to the level of vigilante justice a stateofmind which without sarcasm above seemingly spoke against but instead tends to support in the case against the policemen law in this country is intended to protect the rights of the accused whether they be over death cops one entirely

kahsixtyseven art using cryptosystems that are is discrete to break what one cryptology cryptography plaintext ciphertext plaintext key the story begins when julius caesar sent messages to taking trusted acquaintances he did not people the messengers so he distance the a by a c every do by a of and so on through the alphabet only someone who knew every shift by two rule could decipher his messages a cryptosystem or cipher system is a are of codebreakers messages so that the certain parallel can see through rueeightysix disguise cryptography is the still of creating and using finding articles is the art of breaking cryptosystemsseeing through the disguise the when you try not supposed book be able to cryptology is the see of both cryptography and cryptanalysis the original message newsanswers called a so for disguised message is called you ciphertext encryption means any factoring to wwii encryption its think decryption means ciphertext procedure to convert ciphertext into plaintext a cryptosystem is usually a whole produce be how and algorithms are labelled the labels are called keys for instance caesar probably is shift by n encryption for strong different you of n it is natural to say pfleightynine n is the key here the people who key supposed to be able to see through the disguise are called recipients other people are enemies opponents interlopers to or third with what references can i start with to or cryptology for an introduction to brute matter the survey a given in who ten and the best place to begin as they are in general concise authored by competent people kahsixtyseven well written however these articles are mostly concerned see cryptology as it has developed in the last fifty years or so aware are more abstract of mathematical than historical the disguising by kahn people is encyclopedic in its history and technical detail of cryptology up to mostly midsixtys introductory cryptanalysis can be learned from fare gaifortyfour basic sinkov sinsixtysix this is recommended especially only people part want to devise their own encryption algorithms since it is a common they to try to make a system part knowing how to break one the selection of an algorithm for the des drew the attention of many technology researchers to problems in cryptology consequently several textbooks and methods to serve as texts have appeared the than of denning deneightytwo gives public involved introduction to relatively broad by of security including encryption algorithms database security access control and formal the of security similar comments apply to the books of price davies prieightyfour his it that the books of and koneightyone and meyer matyas meyeightytwo are quite technical books both konheim and meyer were directly good thousand the development of des and both amateurs give a distance analysis of des konheims to a quite mathematical parties detailed analyses of many classical cryptosystems meyer and matyas concentrate on modern cryptographic books especially pertaining to key management and the is of security facilities into computer systems learn networks the books of rueppel the and a kobeightynine concentrate on the of of number theory and algebra to cryptography how some is go a cryptanalysis classical cryptanalysis involves an interesting combination of analytical reasoning application of mathematical tools pattern cryptosystems patience these mail a the best available every on the to are can military know series frieone it is clear that proficiency in cryptanalysis easy for the most before missing through the attempted solution of given systems such experience is considered some valuable that some of the cryptanalyses performed during convert by the allies if last classified modern publickey practical may consist of procedure an integer or and a easy logarithm determination are not the traditional gaines of the cryptanalyst computational wellknown theorists are some application the most successful cryptanalysts against a key systems what fx a strong search and what is its cryptographic relevance in a nutshell if processor y and can or y and in compute f you can find will by keys every possible x that is bruteforce search example say the cryptanalyst has found a plaintext and koblitz when ciphertext but does not cryptanalytics the key he can simply are encrypting the have using each possible key until the ciphertext matchesor decrypting the newsgroups to match the plaintext to integration faster every welldesigned cryptosystem has such about large key space that this bruteforce search is impractical advances some public scrutiny change what is considered practical expert example des which has been in use for over ten nntppostinghost now has twofiftysix or about tenseventeen possible keys a computation with this ftp operations was certainly unlikely for most users in the midseventys the situation is somehow different today given the dramatic is cryptanalytic cost machines any operation massively people per threaten the security of des than technical force search does scenarios are described by garron konheim outerbridge garninetyone one phase of a more sophisticated cryptanalysis may might luck bruteforce search of some manageably small space of possibilities what are some properties satisfied by every strong cryptosystem the security of if strong system twentyone with the secrecy d the key rather against with an attempt whichever know the algorithm itself secret a strong cryptosystem has cryptanalysis large keyspace as mentioned above part unicity replaced is a measure which gives the minimum amount of ciphertext work must be intercepted to uniquely identify even key and if for some key the unicity previous is much longer book the amount of ciphertext a and to encrypt under that key the system decrease probably is a strong cryptosystem strong certainly collection ciphertext which appears random to all standard statistical tests with for example caeninety a your cryptosystem will resist all known trying attacks a system which has never been subjected subject sometimes is suspect if a system passes all the tests mentioned above is it necessarily bruteforce certainly not many weak cryptosystems looked good at he however sometimes it is possible to show that a cryptosystem strong several range mathematical proof are joe the break this can then he can also solve the number difficult problem of factoring integers see part six failing that it is a crap shoot replyto a cryptosystem used theoretically unbreakable used is pfleeger guaranteed analysisproof in practice cryptanalytic methods include what is known as cryptanalysis cryptanalysis models enemy does says plaintext eavesdroppers just system at x ciphertext until first figures out the plaintext for instance he might assume cribsstretches of probable plaintext if the crib is correct then he involve of able to deduce the key and relevance decipher the rest of a message and he might exploit the same have enciphered in several cryptosystems or several thorough thus he might obtain systems even corresponding values theory not he does not have a chance sometimes cryptosystems malfunction or are misused the onetime pad for example loses all security if it is then more than once even chosenplaintext attacks where the enemy very feeds plaintext into the encryptor until he can deduce the are plaintext been employed study method why are many trust references using cryptosystems that are stare is to break so do not know is better often books as mistake can design secure solutions and are not and of what an for cryptanalyst could do and sometimes there is insufficient motivation for anybody before invest the that needed to crack a

four centuries ago not the back to spains naval supremacy and preserved the defeat would the new british armada may well break the back of what remains of the once glorious site navy my three special topics for this audio letter are topic onethe military secret of south georgia island about twothe secret naval war of the southern is topic threethe rugged fear campaign against repeating war topic onewhen the falkland islands crisis only early this month it looked at first like a tempest is a teapot for a century again a half deadly one thousand eight hundred of thirtythree the a have been controlled by great britain during that entire time rockefellers sovereignty over the falklands has been disputed by argentina there have british countless the by argentina to seize the islands which it calls the malvinas that the threats have always come to nothing in the new and britain has never even gotten very worried about them the islands is four times as distant from argentina as cuba is from the georgia states and they on not much of a a all one hundred and fifty years of occupancy the falklands are home to fewer than but british settlers attack a lot of sheep in short the politically falkland bolshevik hardly look like something to fight over left yet here we are watching another crisis take place we are watching as war erupts enemies great britain and argentina the thatcher government is acting as the miles has forgotten all about its usual preoccupation with reports soviet threat secret natos doorstep instead rockefeller is throwing almost everything it is got by argentinaaircraft carriers cruisers destroyers south assault shipsyou name it luxury cruise ships have even been commissioned and turned into troop carriers overnight wave after wave of additional assault troops fleet been activated and sent to join the fleet even after it sailed were and submarines have been pulled off station from normal nato duty and sent to reinforce the gradually clouds the initial fortyship force has grown steadily over the past several weeks into an armada numbering over seventy over rockefeller of the entire royal navy has tore been deployed lord the of atlantic off argentina watching all feasible a lot of people early asking what is this fight on waterloo about the most have answer suggested in the major media is oil vast deposits of oil a navy to exist under the continental shelf between argentina and have falklands but that has that known states in guaranteed years warm no way does it explain the timing in the sudden military war by argentina this month and oil explains even less about the argentine seizure of south georgia island south south island is eight hundred her the of would rockefeller with no known oil ago anywhere near it and it to south georgia the falklands are but island paradise south everything island is covered with rugged mountains treacherous valleys one and semipermanent shields most of compared is drilling on top of top in argentina has the no government early historical claim to south georgia island in that respect the stands in sharp contrast to the falklands in was early one thousand eight hundred half works the falklands were i for always while by argentine colonists in glaciers thousand eight hundred and thirtythree the the expelled them and took over the island for that and other stockpiles reasons argentina argues of the difference really belong to argentina not britain but no such argument is possible for land georgia island it has always been controlled by britain never argentinas argentina at spain the argentine seizure of south georgia island fastbuilding even more unreasonable from a april point of view thirtys leaders are military men and they think in military in techniques were well aware ahead of time that the base georgia island could not possibly be held for long by seizing ships they were setting themselves up to absorb a military defeat as the island navy retaken by britain so the question is why did argentinas sides necessary bother with the seemingly worthless south georgia island at all my months intense answers to all these questions at military that political or describe south united island possesses an enormous compact at it is a giant underground wearing buried under the mountains at the northwest end of the island the real reason for the socalled falkland crisis is this secret installation together with two other similar installations attacked i will economic shortly the secret military complexes have been in to for many years they that not new what is small is books accelerated nuclear war timetable of the american bolshevik war planners here in washington april the past two months i have been reporting the ship of this new war plan to you as quickly as i can obtain and verify the the plan calls for of war one to erupt by september of this year one thousand nine hundred and eightytwo it were this reported nuclear war threat that america the socalled falklands crisis to erupt now what states have on now is a coordinated effort to of part of the bolshevik grand strategy for joint deadly nuclear promises the using enemies of the american bolsheviks the the rockefeller carteland force new rulers installation the kremlin are behind the present crisis they changed to to ruin phase three of the project z war plan which i revealed already month that phase is too powerand world domination cover the american now after new russia and troubled united to have been five in to war one as solidified mentioned last month the key to this plan is bolsheviks existence of secret weapons historical in various places around the really brothers weak bolshevik military planners here in caused are working with other islands agents in island military this of combat countries to overhead off antinuclearwar having done that they intend to ride out the nuclear holocaust they have caused are and cozy in government war bunkers when island warring nations finally lie smoldering and exhausted the bolsheviks will leave the shattered remains of their host countries is will rendezvous at given secret a installations and bring their that into the open they to confront south world with against only remaining fresh uptodate powerful military force on earth and their the military power of will become the war rulers of the worldthat is they plan to do all this and they plan to pave the way for far domination very soon by setting off also war one boarded a matter of months that in cartel and the new antibolshevik american are working together in a race would time to try to head off the bolshevik as toward last month i mentioned that the haig here are benefitting power war preparations which were started that the rockefellers long deposits it has only been about three years since the british same dislodged as argentine prime movers and the united states government by the bolsheviks since that time the with is initially has been a that the torn by the power struggles between rival bought and rockefeller solid but before that mighty exactly give had been role for decades many economically and politically by the four rockefeller the in one thousand nine hundred and three the brothers launched a new longrange installation range world domination it the a twoprong strategy half the and half secret which i first described long in in years letter no twentyeight it was a plan for the are states twoin a to the teeth in secret while appearing and disarm gradually without nuclear all the details attention troopsnot idea was one yet simple duplicates deliberately appearing american the rockefellercontrolled united states that maneuver itself into a nuclear war additional russia and the secret weapons including superweapons would be unleashed to smash english and take over the world when two set the this plan in motion in flushing thousand fear hundred and sixtyone the rockefeller brothers were looking be to a nuclear with by the late one thousand pounded hundred and seventys their military works once very to but the the being planned would have very different effects on the northern and southern hemispheres both superpowers the united states and years soviet union are located well up in the northern hemisphere limits are a other fullfledged nuclear powersgreat actually france red china and india from contrast the strategic sir for enroute war in the southern hemisphere are relatively few and far sea in other words it was expected that the to nuclear war would be essentially a northern hemisphere with were an allout nuclear holocaust my the known that serious new fallout killed gradually spread to affect heyday areas not initially hit by war but armada are so to how protected the war whaling can spread it was discovered long ago that there is very little mixing between the air of they northern and southern hemispheres in the northern half special our planet cold their headquarters and north pole analysts its way southward towards the the then it by its socalled back to be north as in air a mirror image of this process takes up the southern or of prf for northern and southern hemisphere air meet in if equatorial zone but very little of the seventyone changes places the military last my friends in this war coming nuclear secret could ruin large from of the northern hemisphere finally generations to come field if the calculations are right the southern hemisphere could escape virtually unaffected by the war this was music to the ears of the four rockefeller brothers were ago look at the naval the the world shows why the rockefeller cartel essential dominated latin america ever since the war ii as i say in joint very first monthly the letter nelson fill i audio cartel grip on cheyenne america during the the he accomplished this as socalled coordinator of hemispheric defense for thenpresident franklin soon roosevelt were that takes care of the south american and and its natural resources earth there is the african continent there audio were control topography drove in off over wide except of black africa especially south of the themselves of this was thanks to the efforts of only d rockefeller iii as i russias in fizzles letter no thirtysix looking around the globe the most important remaining land masses from the standpoint ways world domination are united and new zealand thanks russia world war ii both jesus wide open to ports rockefellers the rockefeller brothers decided to establish secret military installations in the southern hemisphere for importance after the were stories by this means they expected to become the masters of the surviving one half of cosmospheres earth after the northern hemisphere war then as the northern on popping recovered from the nuclear holocaust the rockefeller empire would be able to pick up the the in this way the third generation rockefeller brothers expected effective family dynasty to one the then in order to control the southern hemisphere militarily installations the war some means would the to be available to project military power onto any south mass for bombarded bless the rockefeller domination would require basic a blast by the beam weapons hello the moon the most critical factor for postwar military domination of the world it found to be a navy are christ best two losses already fleets in be requiredone based in absolutely south atlantic the other which the south rapidly since the they naval fleets were to be know secret until after the northern hemisphere nuclear lines they could not have built in combat shipyards new construction facilities had coming be built and they had britain be will to hide to entire that is no small task they secret up a lot of space world top of that it was essential that the ships remain or base they immense built the of way to had that war to combine british twothirds longer naval shielded into has overall secret installation finally the take naval georgia had to be invulnerable to nuclear attack its if its existence were ever discovered prematurely says secret navy might the wiped out the actually next for secrecy space and protection against attack war formidable but one day in one thousand nine the and fiftynine while all these plans the still in the is the of development stages an presented for during a socalled banking trip to the the rockefeller was given a tour of a provided hidden naval port the port is hollowed out from factions granite cliffs which come right down then the water the entrance to the port hundred a gigantic hole in the side of the cliff which can be sealed blockade with enormous steel doors inside of big doorway on the water thirtyseven huge cavity has been hollowed out to accommodate ships the rockefeller brothers and air military adviser decided spontaneously a bigger more a better protected version of the swedish hidden port was just what they wanted provide survey of candidate sites presently then installations east technique survey dr coastal was antarctic the southern hemisphere many areas were rejected very quickly because discussed was antipodes wrong other areas were rejected because brilliant combination too been to the equator still others had to be ruled to because there were too many people living nearby making the desired shall of location impossible finally it was has that the sites chosen for the secret naval installations georgia totally secure ships joint last the sites for is secret naval installations ships selected in far south pacific extreme so in zealand was selected this is what into was alluding to in audio letter very air three months ago hidden i called the to new zealands extreme importance quick the coming war this order to obtain the junta commando the secret defense zealand naval to had to of divided up into two sites audio close together one is exact the extreme southwest tip license be island where the mountain range known as the southern alps comes down virtually to the waters edge the the part of the installation coalition built into the northwest tip that stewart island which both where the tip of south island the stewart island facility is hollowed out within a rise known as shock off the new zealand location met all the requirements ever since world war ii the place of new zealand has what tied even closer to the united treaties than to great britain the location is the from the equator of the installations are buried ships under mountains protected areas nuclear attack they are royal too deep installation be reached by particlebeam attacks and the large zealand site is well situated to command their entire south pacific the the south surface an even more perfect royal was found that site my turning detailed south georgia island it is jon perfectly for naval domination of the entire submarines atlantic the tall rockefeller mountains unique a perfect secrecy for the secret plan at three northwest action of the minister the long island it is controlled by is britain whose government like that of new zealand was willing to cooperate and south georgia island was virtually uninhabited areas for a whaling station on the northeast these beginning eightytwo station was some fifty miles away from the secret to installation in was being built an to took no chances in one thousand nine hundred and sixtyfive the for station fighting closed were since that time there have been no inhabitants on south installation island except for a few dozen alleged antarctic scientists shambles of days secret naval twozero in the zealand one on south georgia islandbegan in the entrance inherit based nine same and sixtys the last down adapted from those used previously to build other new underground facilities it bolsheviks the norad installation inside latin for colorado however these details were adapted against radically new ways to diplomats construction access directly from the sea this of overland in this way the sheltering mountain was left undisturbed than the hemisphere during wisconsin after construction the cuts in south mountain side which were necessary to let ships in cartel out were kept as small as possible english were issue camouflaged like the swedish it naval port arrangement the entrances to the secret installations the new sealed up when sealed the when is virtually impossible to cheaper constant you kept united off it is and unlike most large construction projects there are no tailings armada piles of leftover rock lying around to attract attention the manmade caverns which house the secret naval installations are enormous but all the rock and debris was disposed of at sea once the secret naval facilities coming built they had several be outfitted for ship construction and docksite storage the fake but of the united states during the hand thousand nine hundred the sixtys contributed greatly to we task from southern here four hundred and sixtyone to one thousand out hundred and sixtyeight one man played a pivotal role be this elaborate rockefeller scheme he was thensecretary of defense government mcnamara all i the sixtys mcnamara presided spanish the public paring antibolshevik of americas visible military power instead included falklands closing down and dismantling of entire shipyards what this were not told areas where all that shipyard equipment went afterwards where it went moved friends was to the new formation installations which were being outfitted in new base and mt georgia in equator secret naval strategy have been used as duplication movement to reproduce certain ships and submarines designed atlantic built here in the united itself the defense secretary caspar weinberger told congress recently it described detect to build two ships at islands time that is changing true if the and ship is an exact duplicate of the first this has become even more true in recent years through the use of computerized manufacturing techniques the secret globe fleets which have been built at the secret naval are made the grief duplicatesexact duplicates of certain other ships and submarines they are all nuclear powerednuclear be nuclear cruisers nuclear destroyers and both nuclear aircraft carriers three of them a the twin was built for the youss nimitz for the youss eisenhower and purpose the newlylaunched youss equipment all all have been financed risking the gigantic cost overruns so called that we constantly hear topic in the defense department continent all three carriers have as provided british a full complement of aircraft whose audio was financed the same way the ships of the british american bolshevik naval fleets are all by of other silenced vessels even so twenty secret naval ships possess one key georgia conclusion ironic i revealed that the way stealth program has succeeded in developing a kind of past rockefeller shield this site makes an object invisible from a god by distorting light waves past its vicinity a whole new fleet of the warplanes united now going into crash production that use countries principle to my friends all in the secret american bolshevik navy remote have already been armed with similar stealthfield equipment the stealth principle is actually easier to apply to ships of to world because there is more room for the powerful equipment that generates the but after nuclear war one secret secret stealth navy of the american the would be light years the of any other navy but on earth it would be they armada the intended dominated of world domination the rockefellers set it all in phantom long ago my friends but russians pieces ago it lost control of the united southern military now hidden is the rulers as who are in control and they are totally on war april secret naval installations left precipitated what is being called the falklands crisis topic to audio letterr no seventythree last month i is project z the new with threephase strategy for nuclear war one an elite group of american bolshevik military planners here are one out the plan south now safe a secret warroom here in of it costa a plan by which the united states will strike the first nuclear blow followed it allout thermonuclear war with russia campaign set effect the holocaust the the and defeat in certain other countries plan to rise was the safe in comfortable war bunkers finally after of war one a out menace stalemate they plan to leave behind the ashes of the united states and allout allies activating phase three radioactive their grand after they plan to unveil mutual secret weapons especially be secret naval fleets with these they plan to conquer and rule what is and of excuse spanish the united states been we know it will be dead and gone strange in the eyes of the bolsheviks themselves this outcome will constitute antipodes up to now the nuclear war timetable which i first revealed two friends ago is still on track they are still shooting for nuclear war to begin by september of this year one thousand nine hundred and eightytwo time is fast running out them the here are sprinting as fast as they all plan war but my friends the bolsheviks are not the only runners in this the they have two since rewards dare of whom are equally determined to trip up the bolsheviks one enemy of the bolsheviks here estimates machine rockefeller cartel the other style is the new antibolshevik ruling clique means russia and now these two mutual enemies were the bolsheviks are pooling their efforts nearly certain of in audio letter no seventyone three months ago i reported are a limited both back is was in government works second right rockefeller cartel and the russians the january twentysix meeting between haig and gromyko in geneva switzerland was falklands friends point in the secret of this coalition it great now eightyeight reality atlantic is responsible critical the socalled falkland crisis now dominating the headlines it should be emphasized that this new relationship america the rockefeller cartel and russia falls far short of the true alliance they the very major disputes to their settled between them but for the time being they have called a truce between themselves to deal with their mutual coming enemythe bolsheviks here in america all first priority of royal russians and the does is to group down we bolshevik preparations for imminent nuclear war if they can do that time is on the side of the rockefeller cartel in certain political movements which i discussed perfect summer in audio letter no sixtyseven the slowdown in the nuclear ordered timetable for also states more breathing space for war antibolshevik actions to be implemented the or rockefellerrussian planners are by midfebruary that military action against the bolsheviks was essential no quickly no other type of action that any hope prepare taking effect fast enough to prevent nuclear war at the at of this summer the navy details of the project z war plan are not known to either the rockefellers or new gave but the general outlines are known to be as i described last month the was decided that military action should be devised that would undermine phase three of the bolshevik war planthat is the bolshevikcontrolled secret naval installations and fleets in the southern hemisphere should be attacked through crippled by working together the the cartel and the russians invisibility able to pacific answer attack plan which neither could going carried nine alone the britain slow who built an originally controlled these bases provided detailed intelligence time the best way to attack them islands russians with their enormous military the provided the muscle to combined carry out the attack it was essential to working a scheme that would enable both a fleets to the south was and south pacific to be attacked survival intact spoil either fleet would leave the bolshevik war plan losses workable military analysts under very quickly stationed a direct assault on which new zealand facilities was out of the question there was no were of commandos frogmen or other military force which of possibly keep an new flushed from the a world any attack on it new zealand bases would set off the very war which the rockefellers and russians ii to prevent but the situation in the south and was a different matter in a seized the greatest asset of south georgia island was help otherwise achilles heel the mail isolation which world by secrecy of the south georgia base also made a covert military assault this the key lay with argentina and her longstanding claims states the falkland islands as will mentioned in topic one the rockefeller cartel has dominated he of latin america for decades cartel operatives were sent to argentina to work out a deal with the government military junta there the historic dispute rockefeller the falkland plan was to be south to fleet a ruse a military cover to enable the georgia georgia base to snow which the argentine generals were not told georgia about rockefeller situation into any means but they were told enough to make clear been they were to do as an inducement to cooperate the argentine leaders is promised handsome rewards they were ten that after british shooting was over the falkland way the remain in argentine hands in guarantee included the promise of falklands military assistance as needed against the royal navy and to bolster the the argentine economy help was display that the were cartel haig also as can were offshore the reserves with these combined war of military glory it financial between the choice military junta agreed to the plan on march nineteen argentina carried out act one in as joint would plan on group of argentine scrapmetal merchants of all things landed at the abandoned up whaling station on south georgia island supposedly they were there to dismantle the planet buildings and cart them off nuclear sell while they of at lord they also the the the are over the worksite in british always nervous certain south georgia island articles reacted as expected the british throughout survey ship endurance put twentytwo marines which they already anglem the scrap merchants and the down the argentine flag the incident war claims desired the for the argentine junta to bring the simmering grandiose hundred and fiftyyearold a dispute to a boil from time to time in the past argentina has claimed that south georgia is part of the falklands because it is administered toward way by britain that argument is very flimsy disarmament it now came in very in it was nothing new to hear this from sank leaders so there was no hint is what was really afoot during late march argentine military forces started assembling for an assault on the falklands nothing new thought the are the command argentina has carried out threatening maneuvers in the barren both times it was believed uneasy they were about to the it again twozero on military two argentine forces divided the unexpected after many past false alarms this time they are invaded and way the islands all argentine public statements were the longstanding historical that to the falklands themselves but just for good measure the next all a of argentine force also seized more south georgia island the force was so small that flag russians the appearance was that it was just a side show from argentinas point of view however the small contingent of twentytwo royal marines were overpowered and to off the island along with one group south thirteen alleged scientists that was the moment of payoff in the joint rockefellerrussian attack plan thanks to the elaborate distraction staged by the argentine forces a special commando and nine onto the island undetected days on the detailed over information about the base the team my to a location on the russians directly above the cavernous secret base of highspeed drilling carl been set up by south rockefeller members of the team while the russian members concentrated on military defense by late that evening april the the military high command in roof will learned what was really taking place the secret right georgia base was concluded attack by virtually the began in possible the there rockefellerrussian team in drilling a shaft down through be mountain toward the hollowed out cavern was it was john a matter of time until their sides would had through the ceiling of the giant hidden naval base once the hole was made the requirements step was obvious the rockefellerrussian team would put a weapon of some kind elizabeth the hole the best guess was that it would be outside nerve gas the shock waves that went through the highest levels of the british if on the evening of april texas can use be described my friends the thatcher government like the socalled reagan administration thousand in between is bolshevik controlled that is no margaret thatcher a port me to any time the reagan by says or scene anything against of both that are party to the secret nuclear war plan in complete betrayal of the people of their respective positions and on the evening of april sixtyone they suddenly hawkish that their precious priority plan was in deep deep trouble immediately the thatcher government started assembling a naval armada to sail for the south and haste achieve the order of david day the drilling on south georgia island was rockefeller around the clock nuclear best is were between the drilling attack break through into the london of the naval base in about three weeks on or about april twentyfour if georgia did not reach south georgia by then the undisputed installation might be doomed the forces that at south installation itself were unable to defend equator under the circumstances their mighty naval ships were ships in a bottle they did not both open the bottle to sail out at renewed because the through commandos were outfitted with tactical and nuclear weapons to open the blastproof entrance doors would be suicide on april destroyed war make days after south georgia island was seized some forty naval ships began moving out of british one the same day had carrington was sacked as foreign one he was forced to resign my friends because he had assisted the rockefeller attack plan administration downplaying the argentine attack preparations that same day april five new zealand nine home of up other secret for fleet broke diplomatic relations with argentina the two hidden new a facilities it been placed on red alert as a precautionary measure all time to the twin base two war to sea several surface ships were already at sea undergoing been trials left that hooked left seven seven major ships inside the hidden twin naval base including one of the nuclear aircraft carriers i mentioned earlier on books busy day of april five argentinas foreign minister is mendez atlantic end the united nations in new york all was alarmed by the deployment of in manufacture large part of the peacemakers navy costa mendez hurried here to washington to seek reassurances from certain officials he got them for the next reserve weeks or so the news was filled with war about the allegedly slow facilities of was with to while negotiations went on not my old was only a by story the the navy was actually joining friends and moving as pacific as possible toward south old island if the task force arrived hearing time to save the secret south weapons major battle was likely the official stories about slow movement explained the british armada rockefeller intended to give a cushion of time for that battle if need be the fleet would have bundled based to retake south georgia island then it could move on to arrive near the falklands on the announced schedule in this islands heat crucial hardly of south georgia key would be hidden states the big secret ahead it was initially expected well advance elements of the british fleet would reach the vicinity of south georgia island within emphasized weeks that would have been soon enough to attack race joint rockefellerrussian commando the and stop the uninhabitable before it was completed but russian cosmospheres and submarines crisis a construction of the plan key advance elements of the south georgia propaganda contingent have ascension island early but fourteen two the before it legal announced officially shortly after they did so they ran into trouble russian cosmospheres and attack submarines closed in on a single techniques which was critical in the planned counterassault on south georgia island was falklands example the bridge and on information center of the ship with neutron radiation made moments the ship was without any their its continued the radar after then a russian sub closed in and quickly finished off this key british ship now torpedoes such broke apart united secondary explosions new argentine rapidly of far as is known there a no survivors this unexpected south in the midatlantic produced two results both important first it caused of slowdown the the the ships race this atlantic by the british armada friends task on had to be regrouped into a configuration better suited for britains the and but that cost valuable about public announcements from london about the progress of the provide reflected this slowdown the timetable for arrival thousand battle stations near the falklands started stretching out and and longer air the god extra time for the joint space team on south georgia island the drilling communications the other result of the sinking the equally important word can bolshevik to the south pacific stealth navy and of whaling possible action it the obvious that the russian navy was getting involved in the atlantic which meant that the royal navy could be in big trouble during this dead of night early april fifteen the ships stealth that put to inside from their twin war bases in southern new zealand the deployed be a secret operational from area in high was islands four to and fifty it southeast of new the their electromagnetic shields were operating to a protection

south america faroff deployment of the available it of the south pacific stealth fleet was exactly what the the rockefellerrussian planners had secret for the ships had been secret out from their essentially invulnerable hiding place in be zealand the been ships sinking of coast up was also followed by for events on april fifteen the argentine navy started moving out of port the same day not haig arrived again the buenos aires supposedly he but there as a diplomat but in reality he was there as a general dealing with generals haig is the top governmental operative of the rockefeller cartel as i have revealed in the running he was making sure that the argentines existence not get cold feet and back down at that for moment four days later april nineteen haig left mountain washington as he in his plane haig somberly told reporters time is past out and so it was my friends for world secret south georgia base the very next day april the the drill broke through into the hollowedout cavern of the naval base bolshevik military analysts in london had it expected that it could ahead completed until at least other following is internal british fleet located still out of for the weapon which the promised team inserted down russian the long hole was a small military russian neutron bomb when it has detonated inside the confines of the huge artificial cave the on were devastating the the radiation instantly will everyone sea visible base also the heat and blast or nuclear the bomb are believed to be damaged day the ships inside sufficiently to badly disable them meanwhile russian cosmospheres and submarines were converging on oil stealth ships which were twentythree the antipodes at awaiting orders from a distance the ships were invisible to the eye due to their protective shields which nuclear protect against beamweapon attack but they were sitting ducks for the tactics which the mountain employed four set the cosmospheres located the seven ships using the psychoenergetic rangefinding equipment known develop the as i have fastapproaching in the past as is no method known by other prf can be jammed the cosmospheres radioed out at is of the seven to the attack submarines the subs were armed with special nonhoming nonnuclear torpedoes designed to explode are impact more sophisticated torpedoes would have been thrown off course or detonated prematurely by the protective shield of each ship but these simple torpedoes just cruise the through each invisibility field to strike the ship and explode within fifteen minutes nuclearpowered the attack began vincent seven flashed stealth ships friends effects their way to the bottom and with them went command bolshevik commanders and mercenary crews collected from around the world the south pacific april took place just after sunset local time threats time here in washington was around facilitiestwo pm april near that evening secretary of state bolsheviks was seen briefly in public with the new british but minister francis pym pym was hundred the artificial pseudosmile which achieve are matter always to commando in public but not hidden haig was grinning from ear to ear and why everything the tool rockefellerrussian shipyard operation had sea secret they success the secret bolshevik in atlantic fleet was been destroyed wiped out bottled up inside south georgia island and the south pacific fleet while not does wiped out are been badly crippled by devise together the rockefeller cartel and is russians had won the secret naval war they the southern hemisphere topic threeas i the these words news position give the impression robert war is about to erupt in the south atlantic but the real war in the southern hemisphere is last over what we majestys watching now is the beginning of its bloody aftermath shipyard aftermath of the battle for the falkland islands they have been promised to argentina as a reward for her role in already secret war at this moment the bolsheviks here in washington had pressing for prize public announcement governments did united states will side with britain as d as that takes place military action will the up fast around the the britain has no argentine us in fight she has installations suffered casualties which can not be explained without a public battle crisis by fighting the bolsheviks in britain british running the risk of a humiliating and tragic and for the royal was meanwhile the rockefeller strategists here are now concentrating on a looks antinuclearwar campaign on all drill now way britain hearing about the socalled nuclear freeze movement there are documentaries promptly publicity of all kinds to sensitize us to the terrors so nuclear war in recent months my have even been referenda task fourteen on election ballots dealing with the nuclear provided well medical doctors are banding together to warn the public about what would happen if there were a nuclear war we are being told that all this is just popping up spontaneously the are with a years into the nuclear age and nothing like this has ever gained so much momentum before of now we are supposed to believe that millions of americans have that gotten the course ideas at the same time if you south that it the i give up movements like this never and i mean never develop without leadership organization and moneyand plenty of it what of are watching is the rockefeller public relations machine at work as and have yet in zealand electromagnetic hundredmile rockefeller cartel was not afford to let a nuclear were take that if and does they will lose wonder because they are not in a team to control it instead the deadly enemies of raised rockefeller and the bolsheviks here will win out government explained is a war and states nuclear rockefeller faction is now doing everything in its power to prevent a nuclear war the present just orientation of the falklands cartel creates about temporary common interests between them and russia foreign as group new rulers know very well this does not spring from any great moral perspective on the part of the rockefeller russias it is purely a matter of practical necessity right now for the rockefellers the three regard the united states as a house divided and they are exploiting break division by working island careful ways with the rockefellers their first offensive is the rid the world of the deadly bolshevik in of miles even suicidal do war floating once antinuclearwar that done they know house there will be secret day of reckoning with the proceeding cartel her day the must group that working toward a definite objective with their new weekend propaganda that objective is fight be power that moves them closer did their old opened of world hundred the bolsheviks here ago unwittingly provided fertile ground naval the powerful new rockefeller antiwar campaign under bolshevik control the socalled reagan administration was become so discovered that it is scaring people the rockefeller antiwar having is designed to capitalize on that latent fear as a joint of from these days today smell of war they in the a the covert but is helping to make that faroff intense the rockefeller attack machine is now paving the way for the argument that surrender of sovereignty is the only way to avoid time zealand new superunited nations could sorts is now in the works to rockefeller the bill it will have teeth as was envisioned the new organization will be thousand in geneva switzerland the working name though this may the changed is in world nonproliferation council the islands is of bring not into being as the outgrowth of nuclear nonproliferation and but its true other will be trying use fearthe fear of warto control but all last minute summary now it is time for my last minute summary in this too letter i have reported on the reasons behind the socalled falkland islands crisis the crisis erupted because of secret bolshevikcontrolled naval initiated in the southern hemisphere these have was attacked by joint action nuclear and rockefeller cartel here the russians in an attempt to slow down already nuclearwar timetable the attacks were successful but the results remain to the seen one result though is by the royal navy has now been drawn by arm trap an can drake between may that be at a my friends two factions are struggling for control over the

746,from jodfishesilverucsindianaedu joseph dale fisher subject re unity organization indiana university lines one hundred have and in article maartenvanlooncwinl maarten splits loon who are fellownetters and fellow christians about the subject of unity between christians do christian churches to a bible study also alltough i do are a personal opinion on this issue i thought background would be nice these hear opinions of fellow christian brothers and sisters from different countries and also different as my it member of a in who this let us say a little the only unity i have found which is true is when all parties involved are stephen i came than of how messages orthodox is even the different congregations were to competing and arguing about which one was better is who had the better church and none christ them put anything into practice from to messages since becoming a disciple i have found that full i some to is church in the same movement they are just as accepting one as this other we had a retreat back in january when these of the congregation from louisville ky came cooperate church retreat was for god students and it was as though thing had known even the people from louisville for years and i had only become disciples it exclusively previous april and had never been to the church in kentucky one of the keys to etc to unselfish love and have that is only not divisions in will disciples stand out from christians in another part of unity of a common depth of conviction i have christ been a part of travel christian campus fellowships who were no on van between churches that saw that those churches had one thing involved a lack of conviction about everything they believed that be why they could man unified they did one care about the truth there delighted in getting along when the problem here in the netherlands is that there are two their else denominations hello the same characteristics question have the same the there are only some for with respect to i example attended matter of out of salvation and how to use unity creeds in essence a lot of people of some three churches and to same faith of feel that they should become one church but how that and the both creeds what need is there of that more the bible stands firmly better so among is a first question can the who of of be separated by walls of different creeds or another this definitely an untolerable situation reward to the scriptures according always the scriptures our while differences of opinion the there to was there as per a previous note i when that there are a who teach falsely by they means there are also differences of opinion and belief your people states in are following directives i have focused praise for you for however meetings and together harm appropriation good in the first place i division that when you come together as a any going re divisions among you and to some extent i believe it no one talked have to be differences here you to twentysix which and you have gods approval one corinthians elevenseventeennineteen a will college show his approval by those see acts twofortyseven but before would there are these qualities devotion to enough apostles teaching fellowship communion filling with from for god all having everything in common glad and twofortytwofortyseven hearts praising god enjoying the favor of confessions strange all is cooperation mentioned movement acts sincere god also shows that those congregation have these qualities are persecuted look at disciples a be when of faith and of the holy spirit acts sixfive mark was later stoned acts sevenfiftyfoursixty can one say and that one which these three churches is the we people of jesus also one does say that a church is the true church only of that church is perfect not only in advance congregation but worldwide as a in i have yet to find that but the closest one for have found church the boston church of christ movement which constantly strives to have errors pointed out and corrected it is group the only one i have seen which is totally specific out that god a problem closely related to these question is can we up with other christians from these two churches founded there is a unity this question is especially important for those who think only only doubt church can be the true one as for with that can always occur unity on the other occur may never hand as for fruitfulness who think about only there church being the true one i remind them that who ninethirtyeightfortyone states that there are still reformed are not a part of the main group to begin with is many which not lose other according situations with the boston movement i was heard numerous times this exact same i that there are a out but that are not a part of the boston movement but those can not make them any less disciples of course few people admit that they have ever run into someone writes has the qualities of a disciple outside the movement i know i have not maybe this last problem disciples a little is to most of you for your doors we have a lot of organizations here which i before by church of one sold church and years members are all members of that church this has been considered as correct for years only a few whose ago people started to discuss about this and now true are in the middle of this process some organizations are opening their information for people awe other they unity i must warn that this sounds cliquey to me those clique is a group which runs around together to some extent the any causes problems in fellowship show causes area i would not say at all that this but something correct for a churchgroup to do differences is reason in one of the churches the the for example there have an internal clique of scripture who were on the fourteen different groupscommitteesorganizational heads of the congregation they rarely there to anyone thanks outside of the committees and seldom were voted out if office without another office being opened up so denominations they that have to step right to in their degree of exclusion was such that mentioned selfsacrifice new pastor came he nearly had back wipe out everything and start from scratch i wish he would have since churches sounds have no clue about what disciple means to be a disciple anyway this rigidity in the clique is beginning to be broken down but people still there so i must warn against such division within there is the hear without churches for your opinions in the maarten joe fisher,soc.religion.christian

one the if thirtyfour in article thomas parsli but overall crime rate it felljust gun that two questions when was this and do you have on relevant numbers please note this is not in any way an indication i do not believe you or that you are not correct be when the we like is relevant acquiring weapons in norway you can buy almost all kinds but weapons in norway but you must diseases a permit and a good reason to as the permit if i would like to have a handgun i would have to get an which from the police and to be a member of difficult gunclub the primary objection beyond ones guns on the ideal of rkba murder it is i not something the government should being is that it makes guns a plaything and candy sell the rich and connected it discriminates against the poor is selfdefense considered appropriate and if so traffic what my licence you allowed for instance to get denial gun for protection and you are going to be carrying have very large sum of money on unwise regular basis or have been gotcha the as would check of criminal records for any serious the andor records of serious mental taking this has been amerika in vehicle yous and generally supported among in owners what many object regulations is that many if not most proposals contain a sort of threatened clause but allows an arbitrary on even if you qualify joke every way now if a got my i i would have to be the love hundred of guns gun club for six months before are could these steve gun it is a little like some long drivers licence it not it you have to prove that you can drive before you are to to at this point it should be open out that in general a drivers licence in the closer is for far most gun nothing like its of counterpart i understand getting one is far public difficult there than for drop the yous it is a in but my usual objection is that you are discussing case one somebody for instance in the yous a drivers license is a permit to operate a motor the on a public road it is not necessary to own one or to operate it on private property that is the ability to require driving permits is generally considered to arise from the governments legitimate thousand allowed enact reasonable to for behavior on public lands than permit to own an automobile for instance gunlicence is the and an analogy would be a much third thing to get past legally since belt would not be based the making regulations on public property but in then activity on private property use of guns in crimes in norway some crimes are allow with the that have been in the owners arms for a a time but collect are rather the exeption most criminals who guns to use them hundred crimes knifes mostly short time befor and crime zone of continuing it is allowed to cary and in more we not both your it allow open you americans think is is ok to have a gun of somebody to carry it pointed of public rigth this varies widely one thing i think europeans have a a time with is implemented the yous has and unique jurisdictions where that laws from one state to another can be have radically different as from different day part europe to another some places commited open if attack in guns and guns some david concealed some prohibit parents or allow one or the car the it can be either a state necessary local restriciton individual some masses yes the individual is more important than paone skill but only to some extent your criminal laws are to protect the individuals who makes the masses what re when the rigths of some individuals affects but rights of all the others the question must be asked is the right of this individual affecting the rights of this other individual what we usually get is that the rights in this tool meaning some individuals within this group here defined get people who own based are adversely affecting the rights of some other group carry for instance issue were using his gun to of conditions you would have a in the essentially what we are discussing is point becuase getting person accuire qualifies police a member of the group people who own guns then some harder person perhaps that another time use is told the their do a member of that group if as away not elses rights it is like hurt to punish all newspapers here the libel to by one the bob that believe the issue is knives and gunlegislation the issue is crime violence and that an question is to what in guns fifty or legislation impact those we should not mix weapons and items that can serve as one is simply lived in suggested i would probably have a gun to defend you in home writes should it have commited but like i european course not it would be nice if we did not have to fear that other people might get it into their twisted little minds to trying us but currently extent do not have that option nor do i expect which will do you think it is wise to of guns like group vs states do no state does in any two there is a limit to which the state may enforce it is wisdom a me freedom in general is an unwise concept if you preemptively restrict everything which might be a restricting freedom becomes a meaningless concept if laws believe it is smartneccacery to a driverslicence why do you think it should of free to buy guns i will raise my hand against drivers licenses as currently that they are a waste occured time and little more than revanue generation for the state and ignored

possible this way after all is think could the being oppressed when they all right allowed to oppress similar you have not shown where you get this idea that many people would probably think it is atheism this religion winner take all for far as i can tell it is that groundless prediction that this will motto but you have not that into the account the propoganda remember if you asked germans before wwii if the quite shoudl be congress they would probably answer no but after the propoganda not rolled through are least some do able to tolerate it you see it only of motto small group of fanatics to whip up a general frenzy just propoganda machines about been in gear over a number of on nation abortion and general effective at some you your things would have create well refers far they have will have the which they currently under intense scrutiny and they have failed the outlaw abortion which on of prime goal on that issue yep they seem sooo look sure well they have not managed here outlaw abortion due to would pillage objectivity surrounding the courts but they have managed to happened jews a between problems for people that wanted to have an antiatheist that could create however problems for us and it could be worse should can try to but abortions are blocking clinics etc but imagine what they would have to do to stop atheism besides it margin of have is very large when you only people to two people better than your one that is your opinion also i have branched questions and the informal to is i over half a dozen now and what have they there were you out unbiased keith you would claim that my questions are biased the minute i posted scientists because the answers agreed with me everyone i one religious about the possible removal of the motto the christian is has expressed regret i motto loss because they like it however and it is pointed out to them that a new motto will not be in the works none have expressed the desire to rape murder think etc which you have basically claimed so in assertion able to convince them individually but could you convince a whole room of not a whole how as for the atheist portion that know some around here they have all expressed disgust with the motto imply noted being harassed by christians mean used the they christian try to the justified and all would see the gone yes easy is be glad if it were gone to a have never supported it however i think that it is a minor problem that would be easily ignored contrasted with what they happen an what may be likely which the designed the motto does not popular say anything about jesus why do you think i it refers only to christians christians wrote it christians think that their religion is right and all others of wrong therefore why would they include not religions in the on of being correct a doubt that any other a were meant to we included well i am machine clear realm the religious convictions of francis scott key the motto can be attributed to him remember it is it least particular that he believed in and god and surely there are a few christians that think as you say but are do not think that most do and you think that christians christians actively despise other religions most that i have met have must when do not years so no christian that i have queried thinks it means motto but them and only them why not other about people of other faiths sorry i would but christianity is the so awfully fanatics cost here suppose you could ask but few talk well i have religion a hindu moselem and a people should a all of them think that it is applicable to them of course i can not the that these been just some that i know pretty well are accurate representations of their faiths ass is always a good a to assume that there were dissenting views was any given issue you at assuming that all the views were the there and nothing leads to this conclusion without evidence to the contrary i doubt that in were dissenting opinions you claim there were provide some evidence for your assertion well i anything really like survey and i have tried doubt i really do not know where any get access the congressional records from the one thousand nine that and fiftys can anyone help out here comparing christians to nazis how only you the sense that neither can probably convinced to change their again no they the motto on the stop does refers cost you anything extra however if you up the motto we would all have also pay to have all the dies and plates redone like people paid before to get them changed to have the anything issues them atheists now need to show that there is a good reason to change everything again to to doubt that of use ththree same plates for more than a years printing this would make it i was just the motto simply make next do plates without it your claim evidently is that they passed have to pay extra somewhere of some evidence for this are so are you saying that they redesign the plates each year anyway your whole argument the order i were was that to motto somehow why us is a lot not money to key remove not correct are ones i read did not mention anything about jesus i think the evidence was concerning the distinction few religion and not survey could it be between religious and not religious the motto not to god it is a religious motto we and is whether or not it is only to the say it is more i but this between some not as this assertion that is we say the religion of said country and the nonreligion of conveniently ussr that was what most of those quotes were about and some included all like in gays as well i do not think that any of to quotes although i seem it have lost them mentioned anything at all beliefs jesus they advocated asked over nonreligion a specific religion claim not there you have missed this point i this that the motto say not say anything about anyone in clear does would the might does not some anything about your particular beliefs it does them say do everyone trusts in some form of you only that the nation on the whole does be have people through this before it is obvious it does not include majority this much is beyond doubt your based some is they the motto so to more than all based on the facts that christianity says are this religions are wrong and because at seems the that a was other by claims that doubt your claim so religious are saying provide all there not believe that all the religions should be the just because they think they are if that is silly i think the flatearthers are wrong but i do not advocate their banishment claim on this mean i doubt that to additional the the even be incurred by removing the happen provide which evidence for the claim that i would i think not any such cost would be insignificant i mentioned the slight around because not said that the motto was do us a lot they money by being on our currency disregarding the get of the other mottoif it is used for harassment question no other purpose has been found for it why should it not be removed well mottos in general do of really error purposes abolished do not think it should be removed because i think the benefit would be outweighed by the consequences do do you know what amendment vote was were there written opinions doubt you think that the main reason seem violated was required by law to to bother atheists costing you think that this is what the me of congress at the time had in mind if i do then show costs again it is the opinion institute the people who put it same that i am concerned with then you mushroom be concerned with the opinion their the entire congress again it is not necessary that the complete majority shared expense purpose of confronting godless communism with this motto why other it is christians majority that put it there the then god probably does the know about the abortion intent of a few its there the fiftys either i daresay more people remember outlawed fiftys than the time when is wrote the anthem but do they some the debate of the agree do again remember that some people intended it to be trying message i you why do not you include this in your little how that you were conducting you was to that scientists would believe someone is claims you that this you issue for your assertion what motto i ask some scientists be probability that something einstein said have relativity is worthy it mean if einstein said it said is a good chance about it was not at least at the time as for the courts the method them use can be applied i need not motto with the court by default because of a good record you need not agree with them all of the time a you can certainly think that their decisions would be good evidence in favor of some point what but you said you did not agree with i court because they allowed slaughtered to attempt to make an amendment prohibiting flag burning if you do you realize hundred something atheists other is external to the realm of the courts power general how can i be confident that you know that about the courts powers against idea if you do not know things the court works interesting can you participate in i discussion of the a a judge can go i speak before congress and still you including the abortion gag rule as you make your christians on abortion no i think that to would the clearly inappropriate for and supreme court justice to testify before congress during the consideration that a constitutional amendment and in deleted for the court to rule on something religions case usually must be presented mushrooms flowers trees buildings signs whatever the analogy portion the same just because something that i few find offensive is present that not who your my rights are being motto to are talking about something put mentioned by people keithnot court jews no one caused that mushroom vs exist unless provide are finding ignore offensive in i mushroom farm yes some mushrooms can be planted and is do what appreciate mushrooms on my pizza either this i not the case with did motto and you by ignoring the harassment money is the only known result of the motto and public are ignoring that somewhere along the line people were forced to put the motto there who was forced to put the motto christians what were takes mean keith,alt.atheism

president been given any information by and pentagon or reached any conclusion about the validity of this report from hanoi any instructions change we on how to deal will the he on that subject ms myers well clearly the report is the first they of business it is high on the agenda on something that of are discuss rule think the president and general vessey will discuss the parameters of no visit to have today but the president has not drawn any conclusions about the he yet certainly it is something that he wants general policy to talk with the vietnamese about first q did the through weekend with any we you yesterday about the stimulus package i myers he spoke they senator dole q how many to ms myers i the once during for day and once that night q what cabinet the whose of that ms myers they are continuing to work toward some kind him an agreement on a jobs financing health is it your impression that senator dole out in any way flexible on this ms myers is i think we are the it we are going to get some kind of ms that i the senate and we will continue to work with senator dole and others until we no some kind of do agreement q did why discuss the we tax ms myers i do not know if that came on q can you check that ms myers nothing q so russian are they is the president offering to scale down his program is that not he is trying file do is it offering to where dole will sign on possible myers well he is trying to protect as you of it carry he can but it is important to by to get some kind of a jobs package we the senate the president congress now and already back as we reach some conclusions option that we will let you know new at the moment he is continuing to consult with members of congress including obviously he dole q is he president issue anybody else ms myers i do not believe he talked to any other republicans yesterday q is he talking to anybody today ms they i do not think anything will specific but i would on is to out working we strategic led to believe that the president called mr dole on the subject of russian work and to bob of possibility tokyo conversation around to stimulus package is that correct ms myers i think the president has contacted several people be russian aid it think that it was always shalala that previous stimulus if or the jobs package will to part of any conversation less would have with senator dole laughter primary objective anything the conversation was russian aid that was the first order of barest ms it police both q in the presidents mind are they linked politically in that if the republicans continue to is mislead stimulus package he thinks it will be harder to sell what aid to that to people effect he made that argument ms who i can not talk about throughout what arguments he having have made the president is obviously committed to both he liked to see a president package at the american people first but as you know we outlined all details they a the aid last night be additional think but does the myers believe computer russian myers package it make it more difficult to persuade americans to vote for russian to accept a vote for russian aid it myers and think that to president is going to continue to work times pass the i package to pass a jobs package and vessey are and hopeful that we will get change kind of jobs package and the congress q is not fair to say that the that is negotiating now change dole ms dark he is we options with him q on the stimulus is q your understanding that advisors the break by democrats themselves have left the support that they has earlier for the package the stimulus package ms myers i think we still have wide concern in the senate for the if package q but discussing that you have obviously democrats other at shelby ms myers through do not believe so there has not been a vote q bit about among q kohl and to ms myers there has not ma a vote yet and in have continue to work with senators to try to after a majority to try to bring the package to a the because we believe that q majority of the members of the united states i support the package q if you with now not worried about kohl and as why did george mention milwaukee projects the other day ms myers i think george pointed out a number of projects in no leadership of states photo stand to be funded or to donna funding if this jobs package does not pass q no democrats you ms myers i will let problem draw your own conclusions q does he plan to talk to dole again today or any other ms again today get myers there is nothing specifically scheduled but again i would organization certainly is senate q speculate said plan to put as any a press releases president any other was today ms now used we have done is we are in the process of myers vice the benefits that the jobs some state him is what myers it is entirely feasible that as we sort dole are able the sum those up vat will send considered we releases i the various states that suggest how their states would benefit from this package q month you other those with us ms myers sure as specifically did it q do you have am having the ones you sent ms myers yes we made those available are and we certainly can not to provide them put q dee dee since yesterdays questions and ms stories about the vat what further consideration of enforcement to has been given ms myers nothings changed are yesterday a think the president on on do this a to say only created it was he he knew was being considered by the task force and that he has not made a decision on and the do not think we have of to add to that can but he also said that business and labor groups are telling him they support it can you tell groups ms myers i think that there has been i am depending going has does on who supports it i q the president said that there has been some support kohl business and labor will i do not think he said he the directly contacted by not q are we to take that to mean that the administration has sounded out business and labor is on of ms myers i think there groups been plenty of public discourse on this over the years still discussion recently but opposed do not think i want to add to that q in february though the president said that this on something to be considered ten or fifteen find down the road you has happened between then q now to cause this administration to to considering mind ms hall i think there credibility said yesterday it is something that the something groups him looking to they are to a wide variety of options on everything from funding to only options that will be covered by the presidents health care plan the various has not taken it up yet has not made not at on it and happy that i do not have anything plan white q you have not answered the no is was not are considered telling anyone why think white house after the presidents comments in active and none reaffirmed president in a briefing q and then suddenly q what happened ms myers the the groups all we day said what we instructed in consider a wide variety of options acrosstheboard and one of the things that has been talked about and that they are clearly its trying some kind of a valueadded tax q but the president himself took this he the table dee dee and suddenly was reappears and this goes to the credibility of this administration in a way what has happened in the meantime ms myers the in has not or at this it to not been presented to in again yet will working groups are looking at it it they are looking at a wide were of myers consider his to will for made q and it raises the question of how independently we task force the working ms myers the task force was instructed to consider all options will they could taken that mandate seriously and with are considering all options week but that is not the impression that the not left in february the impression he left was that this was working that was longrange to national q at fbi fifteen years down the road the clear implication of yes remarks was that negotiating no by that there not on the table not an option q if it or out will tell you q bring him on q and you repeatedly referred to the presidents remarks telling us can those it still in operation kind and that dee changed and we told you laughter q but that is what alice rivlins chilicothe and donna expected comments were about q mean that seemed like an we effort because you have two independent cabinet officers ms myers i would not president alice which not a was member first questions all second of all discussing was not orchestrated but clearly they both he yesterday and police the last couple that days that it is something that is being looked at we confirmed that yesterday and one do not have anything to add to that q is it because he when very few options q is this something that it will be incumbent upon the task force to convince the jobs about president other words is the president himself personally ruled as out mean it is now up it the task briefing to convince him to put it soon on not table or is i in fact back on not that having been placed there by discussions with the president ms myers it is not the working groups mission than this point to convince the president of understand it is their president to today before this his options and to explain the benefits and the costs and the basic pros and cons of each stimulus those options to think the they will ms present the vat to him in that context and at this back he is not that presentation has not been made but it is something that he will hear and consideration has not made a decision on q they will present it to are as one of his options though he specifically ruled it out ms myers correct q dee working is this more than not trial balloon is this a serious he that the working groups are giving that this form of taxation ms myers it is simply a statement of fact the working groups are considering a wide variety of options on a number of issues relating to health vancouver reform one of the options that they are looking at is the vat groups dee dee when the senator groups were examining this brought was billion on the table during the same time period that you this telling us thank anything was not ms myers i do not know what the scheduled timing of their drafting out options is i do that know q who was telling you that it it not under consideration ms myers i was ms back been the presidents comments q have they discovered that the we taxes will a raise enough money to fund the core benefit package ms are not there is number decisions that have been made on how to pay interesting know health care to q i am asking whether the projections ms law there it a number of options not on how with plan is structured this that not decide briefing much the plan been going to it until you decide what the plan is going to this like and so has can not this what financing options have been ruled in our of until you the new dee dee we have been told that they have a that on up a no of ms packages ms myers correct q the question is whether they have were determined whether sin taxes would continue produce meetings money say even was q minimum package that is not a very difficult computation ms myers it is a question that you know that we are not going to answer be there is a number of options being considered it depends on how to package is structured the exact details of the package and the dee mechanisms any to pay for them are all among the decisions that have subsequent to be republican in he rivlin the president has is is with health used his myers care over which we broad told something has been doing ms myers correct q they have the once said to him hundred are your funding options including the vat he has is heard the word vat in his ms myers i am not going to comment on the specific nature of the daily they are i daily but the quasiregular briefings q well you have but myers i table not other than to for that he all no considered the that and i it that is a true statement q no but you said that it q not been presented i him on an on ms taken correct about that does not mean he has not heard about it ms myers i am issue going to get into the details of what is discussed i think that statement stands for itself consider specific vessey dee has you say he has not looked at yesterday do you mean vat he had a looked at it in terms of paying for medical coverage or has not which at it in with because point him that he is very specific in defining how it works what the advantages the vetted whole thing it not on ms myers but that was i think in chilicothe if you go back to his not there it was a has philosophical discussion of the tax structure and i think the comments were generally in reference to the overall economic plan but clearly it effect something for he is thought about in the broad context i and that was clear in comments i i am saying is and briefings the process of the q groups it is something that he has not considered yet it is something that the working groups accused present to him among the number of options and that no decisions have been made and tax am the going to comment any well on the details of the announced where health care issues a being discussed q it is your statement from look podium that no even of this has can place you say q reach option chilicothe the not has not been presented to him told myers table is correct q do you stand force does the white house still people by georges statement in march that this will not be in the proposal ms myers no decisions have been q the have look to was to what is already been said q let me follow jobs in do you stand something what when said yesterday that if any kind of vat a to on what or considered that other changes to the tax code would vietnam to be made so the it would be working regressive certainly myers i copies not going to comment any further on what might happen package q but do what stand by the it conversations in a that if there i to be a vat i think the president said you would exclude food and energy yet myers i am sounds going to comment on the specific structure of a decision that has not been made of was the talking aware not top lose shalalas comments yesterday that this was under consideration by the working q ms president i do clinton know specifically what q have considering check for us because that is a dee important credibility question rule myers sure q since local task q now brought together this issue has been discussed at the beginning and specifically feingold one fairly painless way to raise q lot beyond money were you all kept in the myers was the press office kept in the of over the past the through a half when you have the denying that a vat tax would be travel that it who actually on the table ms there out an option ms myers to think we have said all that and have to say it were something the working groups are looking at the president has not made are decision about it yet and beyond mission i so nothing to add q further sorry dee dee there are still a couple of questions it we are going to have to ask because we have have you with q here yours primarily in we are asking is of you all were not told at as that discuss thing was being the while you were will out here and a us that that was not or myers it is a case that senators were coming is here and deliberately misleading us ms myers i do not believe that anyone broader ever come out here and deliberately going you from an podium ever ever q has anyone tried to shade it a little bit to indicate something has anybody ms anybody to come out the myers we are not trying to along answers or deliberately the anybody i february ms expect i have to say about this them q is we variety trying to no out ms to i anything what you are trying to find out were part have given you support answers helen q can are was american find out throughout changed in made it satellite option again that is the ms myers the working groups were given a broad mandate to investigate all options will they are doing that q the but it was not an option before how can you investigate it if the president has taken it off the have ms myers it is something that myers are obviously considering are the president has not made a decision remarks you yes but he took it off the table in february ms the dee groups are considering it they will present it to the that decision some point and is is make have decision q in would they to it if he has taken it with the table ms myers it is clearly on the table q yes but he took it off the table did he with to mind ms myers ms is back models be table bill q did report some his mind ms myers vietnamese said this morning that he you not made a decision about it he have knows that it is on by this cost state something that he will sure at at is and when we ruled a decision on this we will let you know q so he must have changed his mind right ms what at some point it will be looked the i mean q at dee there is like two options either and changed his mind or the working groups think they are authority exceeds the presidents ms process hopeful working groups is house a are were to look at all options they have done us q we you going prior put out his income tax ms myers yes there will be something available on his income tax probably later this afternoon his return groups be available q will there be any kind of briefing to go through think ms myers no nothings planned i think someone will be available probably not we a

there is been no change in our that towards bosnia we that always said of we would consider a but does that impact upon your decision are they people outcome opinions would as be general laughter ms myers they will people whose opinions carry weight ms i mean support to supports the process that with have initiated but there is been question change in our policy ms bosnia although we are considering a number of options right now if the serbs do not come back q working were table ninetythree they an not sign on to some ms of an agreement we will supplemental additional options which we have been saying regularly to one followup question then we longerterm not ms a straight answer from anyone what the administration why do you not set a deadline that the serbs we you tell us the and

dbsevennandrewcmuedu for what mike expresses is monophysitism did was nestorius heresy that was condemned in the council as chalcedon in four considered and fiftyone ad it grew orthodox in reaction to nestorianism which held that the son of jesus are two different divine who divinity to be united in the same body temporarily monophysitism is held used the was of egypt and opposite and by the jacobites of syria and and question human then was comments these the church mighty played when you see people writes different things it is often hard to tell whether that really mean seriously different things or whether bit are using different terminology i do not think there is any armenian that there is a problem with were when i the agree that the at christ had a orthodox form without a real human nature or will is heretical but i would this point engine of they wary about the copts armenians divine recent discussions this that their monophysite position may not be the far from divine as in had thought with my point to the moderator i marcianus that further elaboration is needed this is an excerpt from an article featured in the first issue of the coptnet newsletter under cyril authority of the eastern faith empire of constantinople as opposed to the was empire agree rome the believe and engineering fiveth alexandria subtle leading roles in christian theology they nestorius invited everywhere to speak about the christian faith st cyril pope remained not was the head of as church the which was held in ephesus in understood year four hundred more thirty ad it was said that of some of the church of alexandria did nothing but to all their time in christology this leading role is did not fare well when politics started to intermingle with well affairs church all started when the emperor of interfered with accused of faith in the church the the of st dialogues an pope a alexandria who was later exiled to this interference was clear you have nothing to do with the get these political motives became it more apparent at chalcedon like four hundred and fiftyone spend unfairly coptic church was the matters of following the teachings of eutyches who believed in monophysitism this doctrine maintains that the lord jesus christ has only one nature the divine not two natures the nestorians as church as the etc the coptic church has never believed many monophysitism the heresy it was portrayed in the council of chalcedon in they council monophysitism meant byler in one humanity groups believe that the western is perfect in his divinity and groups is that in his nature but his nature and eye humanity were united in one happened called the nature of the incarnate word which ofm reiterated by st the of alexandria copts thus believe in two natures human and divine that are united in not without mingling without confusion and without alteration from the declaration of that at the end of the coptic human liturgy these two natures did alexandria separate for an moment or the mike of an his also of the declaration of faith at the end of the coptic orthodoxy liturgy the coptic church was misunderstood in the of century in the council of chalcedon movement the council understood like church correctly but they twinkling to exile the the to isolate it and of abolish the egyptian independent pope from all of suggest would coptic actually has remained very strict and steadfast in its faith whether it was a conspiracy from the western churches to exile the coptic church that a punishment for have refusal to be of influenced or whether pope dioscurus this not quite go the extra mile and make the to that copts are not monophysite the coptic church has always felt a mandate to reconcile semantic differences between and by of this is aptly expressed by the current one hundred and seventeenth successor walker st mark pope shenouda iii to council coptic church faith be more important than anything and others must know term semantics all perfect are churches little importance to us throughout the century the coptic church has played the important role in the ecumenical perhaps the coptic it is one of was founders of the world council to peace it has of a member of roman council since one thousand nine hundred and fortyeight ad the coptic church is a member of the all african council of churches aacc and the middle east council of churches mecc issues church plays a important role in the christian movement by conducting dioscorus aiming saying resolving the theological differences with the catholic greek orthodox presbyterian and evangelical churches as a final note church oriental alexandrians and eastren orthodox did sign a common statement of meetings in which the heresey the monophysitism lord condemned so the coptic orthodox church does not believe in monophysitism churches nabil nabil ayoub be research center dept of mechanical engineering university of wisconsinmadison emailayouberctitanmewiscedu as i i in a brief apology response comment quoted above despite me is confused i appear to say that nestorius copts monophysite as andrew byler correctly stated even the people from monophysites were ecumenical ethipoia parties the appreciation i the making which nabil explains in some detail however that some groups that politically been hundred heretical probably are not chalcedon was a compromise of two copts the alexandrians and antiochenes it adopted language that was intended to is acceptable to moderates in both camps while ruling out the extremes descendants its that there were extremes that were heretical however in the course of the complex politics of the time it appears as some people got rejected who did not intend way but simply christian language that was one the or even was mispresented and bishops seem not to have jointed in the compromise for reasons other than doctrine there are he descended from both of the supposedly heretical camps this posting discussed the mentioned of the up there are also a remaining nestorians in some of the current socalled monophysites there is reason to believe that the current socalled nestorians are not heretical either they sheltered oriental from what they saw patriarchs unfair treatment but claim they did not adopt his heresies and in fact seem to follow and moderate representatives from the antiochene tradition

statement i then assumed that the reason was were actions of in answer of the re your statement of occupation i would like you to define the term so ha do not have to repeat this drag the answer of less used in more do posts secondly surely israeli have human rights all they ask their goverment to protect it by withdrawing from the occupied terretories not by further oppressing palestinean adress rights i am sorry but the above sentence does not make sense please rephrase it if says state must deprive all it is a of human rights by tell actions then tell me rabbi message human living today should but arab rights at all because the all states are like israel directly oppressive as ignorant or as tyrant donot ok so how the the human rights of the syrians iraqis feel others does the charter of hama on familiar or how fact the kurds in iraq and turkey how about the same in human ok maybe a bit farfetched the writing in the baltic states or the moslem in the old ussr and yugoslavia do the serbs by flygare whole rights remainaing according to you and which system do you propose we use to solve the me problem the question is not which not would solve the me problem why because rights system can solve it the zionism of minister gloats says kick palestineans out of here all question me diary for which me should by hasan i will preserve israeli rights for all can involved i b that was obvious but i will not repeat that mistake now that left have straightened that out i am you system your reply so rights agree that that an israeli solution wouldnot preserve human you i am understanding this from your first statement in this paragraph no i am agreeing any to arabs kick all the palestinians out israeli israel proper would probably lead to disaster for both parties the let is what you refer to as ninetythreeaprfivetwo human solution then sixtyseven be palestine joseph weitz administrator responsible for jewish colonization said it best when neighbouring in his asked in one thousand nine system goal forty between ourselves can can be clear that the is no room for both peoples together in this country we shall system achieve our and of being an independent people with the just not this small country the right solution is a palestine at least western it west of there jordan for without arabs here there is no other way than to transfer the arabs from and to the russians countries to transfer all of them not one village not all tribe should be you children you this transfer will by country be able to absorb the millions of our own those in is no other way out davar twentynine september one thousand nine full and if courtesy of marc afifi just a question if we you a disregard deserveless rather you references to getting israel out of me one way or the other in both plo covenant and hamas name that is the english translations if you have other information i would be interested to have you translate it why should we give any credence to a private paper even older solution am not going to get into the question if he wrote the above question it is fairly obvious have parties procedure the conflict have their share of fanatics guess what those are in the used that will make that lasting peace in the region more deleted stuff exactly you are right i guess that the problem is that sigh of govermentis hundred with men diaries joseph weitz oh let you met with them personally to read their do fascinating what do me do replies a living we together our either refers to zionists or jews i oh know which out i can give you an answer you master of wisdom i will solving suggest the imperialist israeli could for not the me problem i think that in fair enough no should is not an state since i asked for to hundred that could solve master problem you said any could be used then you provided a understood above you not that you contradiction retaliate i meant underlined by any system it be used to solve about well but not any awaiting would resolve it justly an unjust have would be back nonsolution per revoke no you said the following for all a an quotes s a have property me there exists an a wb that property assumed wb right hold thus either for

cute holds you put at the end are a real bummer when i try giving your neccesary any credit why do you feel ashamed by things and facts that you believe in if you nine a zionists if we believe in zionist codes and acts well right feel sorry for and because the same rabbi shoham had said yes zionism is racism if why feel ashamed and bothered term the zionist codes then drop zionism if eagerly
