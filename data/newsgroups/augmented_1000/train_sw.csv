yes defragger is come from norton
if you have norton utility do not bother


     do not bother if you have cpbackup or fastback  they all offer options

hi

in canada any gun that enters a national park must be sealed i think it is a
small metal tag that is placed over the trigger  the net result of this is
that you cant use a gun to protect yourself from bears or psychos in the
national parks  instead one has to be sensitive to the dangers and annoyances
of hiking in bear country and take the appropriate precautions

i think this policy makes the users of the national parks feel a little closer
to nature that they are a part of nature and as such have to deal with
nature on it is own terms

 but what came out in much lower profile reporting was that the
 victim was a prostitute and the man had not paid her  hence the
 false accusation

 there was no evidence the woman in question was a prostitute the
 defense merely alledged that she was

the fact that she was wearing a miniskirt with no underwear was
presented as evidence that she was a prostitute and the court
apparently found this compelling

 even clayton knows the difference  err perhaps clayton does not know
 the difference

clayton does indeed know the difference  greg apparently does not

 the judge found that there was some credible evidence that the marines
 were engaged in selfdefense

 no the judge found that the prosecution did not carry out the burder
 on proof

because the judge found that there was some credible evidence that the
marines were engaged in selfdefense  got it knucklehead

 a small clipping from clarinews under fair use guidelines 

    new hanover district court judge jacqueline morrisgoodson ruled in
    the benchtrial that the state failed to carry its burden in proving
    the marines acted to cause injury

because in part repeat after me the judge found that there was
some credible evidence that the marines were engaged in selfdefense
hopefully one of these days you will understand

 interesting that in two of the three cases clayton does what he accuses
 others of doing

with respect to credibility i would rate clayton cramer an order of
magnitude higher than a the news media and b homosexuals

subject re the arrogance of christians
organization nottingham university

in article  you wrote

 the genius of science is that it discovered that enormous progress 
 in knowledge could be made by isolating the study of physical 
 interactions for the more general areas of study and proceeding
 not by logical argument but by experiment the scientific method
 is hypothesize attempt to disprove the hypothesis if you fail 
 publish if others fail to disprove your hypothesis accept it
 as a working theory and move on this method is suitable only
 for the study of objects without will objects which do not
 take an interest in the experiment

science does not progress via experimentation but by philosophising  one
aim of experiments is to investigate the validity of the hyptheses
resulting from the models produced by this thinking process

 the arrogance of science is the assumption many advocates of 
 science make that the scientific method is the only method of
 serious study the only one leading to knowledge rather than
 belief 

science has one advantage of all other approaches to explaining the world
it is objective

 its further arrogance is the assumption which arises
 that since science is the only valid method of thought everything
 which exists must be the sort of thing which the scientific 
 method can study and that if the scientific method cannot 
 study it it either does not exist or cannot in any way be known

anything which affects the physical world can be studied  for example
since we are part of the physical world anything including spirits which
affects our behaviour can be observed  science does not make any claims
about the existence or nonexistence of objects which do not affect the
physical world

 since these asumptions about the nature of the world cannot
 themselves be made the subject of experiment it is bad science
 to believe them as well as arrogance illogic and just plain
 sloppy thinking

the purpose of science is to produce a model of the physical world  the
model must be able to explain all past observations and predict the outcome
of future observations  one of the aims of experiments is to carry out
well defined observations which are objective

ideally scientist will except the model which best describes the world and
the model which realises on the minimal number of assumptions  at the
moment models which do not rely on the assumption of some spiritual world
existing are equally powerful to ones which assume the assumption of a
spiritual world  as the nonspiritual models has fewer assumptions it
should be the currently accepted models

the scientific process never assumes that its present models are the
correct ones whereas many religions claim to represent the truth  the
arrogance of many theists is that they claim to represent the truth this
cannot be said of scientists

wales conference adams division semifinal
boston vs buffalo
the bruins are playing some excellent hockey and with cam neely back
and moog his old self again this should be a cakewalk  bruins in five

i am hoping for a fuhr miracle but i agree that boston will likely win the
series  goaltending is about equal top offensive players are about equal
mogilnylafontaine vs oatesjuneau but buffalo has no answer to neely
not to imply that neely is not a top offensive player by the way in fact he is one
of my favourites even though he is a damn bruin    and the rest of the
matchup wrt lineup favours boston anyway  but i think it will go six

quebec vs montreal
this one is very tough to call montreal certainly has the experience
factor but quebec is more talented imho it will come down to the
goalies  i will go with experience and roy canadiens in seven

agreed herebut montreal will be pushed to the limit  is it just me or
does everything montreal does in the playoffs come down to roy  go habs

final
boston vs montreal
will bruin domination continue in this rivalry yes moog has
consistently outperformed roy in the playoffs after one thousand nine hundred and eightysixother stuff
 bruins in five

i cannot predict a montreal victory because i have been watching them play for
six weeks and i am going to they severly need some tougher players especially to play
in the garden  last time they beat the bs fivetwo but boston had a clear
territorial advantage the victory was roys  at the same time i cannot
bring myself to predict the possibility of a loss so i will just say i will
not be putting money on this series 

patrick division semifinal

pittsburgh vs ny islanders
what can i say the pens are flying high and have the most talent in
the league 

agreed  ny does not have the goaltending to stop the onslaught independent
of the trouble they have given pittsburgh this year  pens in five which is
credit to ny

washington vs new jersey
capitals in five

agreed here too but i think it will go at least six  jersey has a decent
team and washington has done poorly against the division this year

pittsburgh vs washington
if the caps had bill ranford i might see an upset but don beaupre
just does not inspire my hopes  penguins in six

i think they will use tabaracci more after beaupre gets shelled  i do not
think it will go six eithermaybe five

conference final
pittsburgh vs boston
a replay of last year the penguins are just as good as twelve months ago
and the bruins are much improved but penguins in six

if pittsburgh plays boston i am going to they win in likely five possibly six  they
own the bruins  if they play montreal i think it will go to seven and once
again i will not be putting money on the seventh game  i say seven because the
habs have played pittsburgh very tough this season

campbell conference norris division semifinal

chicago vs st louis or minnesota
 blackhawks in five

chicago will win but i think in at least six  chicago is not that good
i am going to  and remember that they take ridiculous numbers of penalties

detroit vs toronto
the leafs have had an excellent season but they have been playing
playoff hockey all year  the habs under burns were the same way and
always wilted in the playoffs  red wings in five

very true  the leafs have much to be proud of but they will soon find out
why montreal did so lousy in the playoffs  toronto might win two or three 
at mlg though  wings in six maybe even seven

final
chicago vs detroit
 this will be a war fedorov will win it in ot red wings in seven

it will be a warpossibly the most intense playoff series of them all 
and yes i think detroit will win  probert will have to come up big though

smythe division semifinals

vancouver vs winnipeg
 canucks in seven

our first disagreement  canucks are playing like shit  they do not use their
size at all which may explain why they get hammered eightone by a team
chasing them calgarywinnipeg in six

calgary vs los angeles
this would have been tough to call except for three things one the
kings do not have a goalie two gary roberts will be back three the kings
shot themselves in the foot by trading a proven winner paul coffey
for a proven loser jimmy carson gretzky is just too weary to carry
this group flames in five

this is also tough for me to call because i have not seen the smythe enough 
i do not think roberts will be well enough to figure in coffey is a
nonissue who cares what carson has done before and never underestimate
gretzky  la in six

final
vancouver vs calgary
 flames in six

if it is these two calgary will not need six games  but i think it will be
lawinnipeg anyway and la in seven because of home ice

coference final
detroit vs calgary
 red wings in seven

wow must have been tough to go against your team  but let us see i picked
ladetroit  detroit will win probably in six

stanley cup final
pittsburgh vs detroit
three in a row and official dynasty status for the pens or can the
wings complete a dream season well the wings are better in goal not
sufficiently so though imho and have better dmen however mario and
the boys can sure score look for jagr to shine in the playoffs
though i sure would love to see probert beat some sense into him the
pens are just too much especially since detroit will have a tougher
battle to get here penguins in five

if pittsburgh plays detroit it will go longer than five and i would not bet
against the wings  they are very strong i am going to and nobody knows how strong
because they have been underachieving most of the year  if forced to choose
though i would have to take the penguins

a side note  vlad last week you said that selanne was a better player than
gilmour  no way  he is a more talented pure goal scorerbut aside from
the age difference there is no way i would take him over gilmour on my team
i am not asking for flames either by the wayi have spent more than enough time
arguing on behalf of selanne and i still say he is a great player  but while
he and gilmour are both dangerous offensively give teemu an edge
gilmour does it all  i know a lot of gilmourbashing goes on esp
from flame fans  but i am going to you guys are letting your dislike of gilmour cloud
your judgement when it comes to his skill  he is easily one of the best
allround players in the nhl

      do not buy one that is the best way to avoid tickets
      i used to have one and whenever a cop would pull me over see
      the thing give me a ticket  one time my sister was driving
      and had it in the glove compartment it was broken and she
      got a ticket  in one thousand nine hundred and eightyseven i had received four tickets because of
      it one for my sister so a total of five

      that was five years ago now i do not have one and have not

      drastically  only two days ago i was going seventyseven mph on highway
      with fiftyfive mph limit cop saw me i break a little nothing
      happened i was driving a minivan with my family in it
      otherwise i have cutlass supreme  which i do seventy most of the
      times on the highway

      so basically my opnion is not to get one if you do get pulled
      over the cop will hear your excuse but if you have a radar
      detecter he will not again this has been my experienc


just get a remote model that is not visible to the cop  but be sure to get
front and rear sensors

you can also just put the detector off to the side on the dash so the cop
does not see it right awayvalentine is the best detector by far as stated
by car and driver and even tells you what direction the radar is coming from
 it also gives the amount of threats it is picking up so if you go through
 the same place everyday and it always goes off there you can glance at the
 number of threats the valentine is detecting to see if it is a genuine cop
  it is about three hundred and you can only get it factory directone problem

umm when i was doing sound reinforcement for a living i used to get direct boxes which convert
unbalanced onefour jacks to balanced xlrs for about twentyfive each or a little more for higher
quality you will need two for a stereo signal of course and a little adapter thingy from 
radio sht to convert from rca to onefour total cost should be around fifty you can also buy
transformers for quite a bit less and wire them yourself total cost there should be under thirty
you can get all this stuff from any pro music shop that sells sound reinforcement gear
the benefit no noise that you can hear will be generated in the cables going to the component
with the balanced inputs even when you run them in bad places like next to power lines

i have not been following the previous hrs  but there are two that i saw
live that would have to be up there up where there  
one rick mondays hr to bury the expos in the nl championship in one thousand nine hundred and eightyone
it was hit off steve rogers who is a rhp and primarily a starter
why was he used as a reliever when the spos had reardon and billlee
warming up in the bullpen  considering monday could not touch lhp
lee would have been a safe bet  he was not even doing any drugs at that
time or so he told me and around fifty others on a recent venture into 
montreal  the blast was not the important aspect  it was the timing
seventh game a tie game and in the top of the nineth  the expos almost
came back though
two mike schmidt hit one that killed the expos in one thousand nine hundred and eighty  so close yet so
far
and
three strawberry killed a pitch on the second day of the season a couple of
years ago  it went off the technical ring in the big o  it almost left
the stadium  that was hit hard

my guess of how part of a session might look

question do you approve of clintons performance

conclusion clinton has a low approval rating because he is not moving

reaching the speed of light lightship altares the fourman crew 
eventually journeyed into a black hole and ended up on the far side of the

satisfied in those days

wow  i was beginning to think that i had made that up  i remember that
movie it was about onefive hours long  i do not think they ended up anywhere
in the known universe  

i remember they got a message halfway out to proxima centauri that earth
transmitted a day after they launched timed to catch up with them at the
halfway point  i thought it was neat i think i was all of ten at the time

does anyone know if into infinity has been released on video i have some
spaceone thousand nine hundred and ninetynine shows on vhs and know that thunderbirds etc also are available in
england
 
spaceone thousand nine hundred and ninetynine has just come out with four episodes released in american stores

me
what seems to be happening here is the situation getting totally blown out of
proportion  in my post i was referring to your regular patrolman in a car
cruising around the city vs gang members  of course the police have access
to the things that you mentioned but do they use tanks and such all of the
time  of course they do not and that is the point i was trying to make  every
day when i go out to lunch i always see cops coming in  the majority that i
see are still carrying revolvers  not that there is anything wrong with a
revolver but if you are a cop that is up against some gang member with a
couple
of automatics in his coat i mean semiauto handguns you are going to be at a
disadvantage even with training

david

      this is the arms race fallacy  that somehow bigger guns make an
individual safer  the problem is that for each corresponding level of
offensive power the is not an automatic level of defense increase  the
problem is that there is a sort of lethality threshold that once you get
past you are only talking about a metter of degree

      regardless of what cops are up against there is really no reason
for the average beat cop to have anything bigger than a pistol on him
as a personal weapon and maybe a rifle and a shotgun in the cruiser

      i mean think about it  carrying a monster pistol or submachinegun
does not make the cop any less wounded if somebody shoots him  a lot
of police departenments have switched to semiautomatics as better
more reliable weapons and more stopping power but there is a point
of diminishing returns

this is a very very good point  who cares what kind of gun you have got if
you are lying on the ground dead

      and as far as automatics go any gang member carrying around a
couple of automatics an incredible rarity is going to be far more of
a menace to himself and innocent bystanders than anything he might be
tryinh to aim at  one auto is hard enough to control  anybody who
could control two is going to get the police officer regardless of
what the police officer is armed with

more stuff deleted  mostly mine
        my question is this  what would a police officer gain from
having a submachinegun or similar personal weapon that he already
does not have with a ninemm or tenmm semiautomatic pistol  i do not see
as how the police should be hosing around fullauto fire nor has
my experience with police officers or the stats regarding how many
police officers get killed by other cops made me feel such would be a
good idea  precise fire is far more preferable  nor should they using
bigger guns  most standard sidearms have more then sufficient
stopping power when properly applied  all more powerful weapons would
do is make the likelihood of death higher without really giving police
significantly more options

another very good point that is well taken  it seems that when lots of lead
is flying either the cops or the gangs someone innocent always gets caught
in the crossfire

paone hundred and fortysix thousand and eightutkvmoneutkedu  i still remember the way you laughed the day
your pushed me down the elevator shaft  i am beginning to think you do not
love me anymore  weird al

all points made above are well taken  i guess i am in the mindset of
having more makes it better which is obviously not the correct mindset
to take in this discussion  now that i think about the situation a
little more carefully i see your point exactly david and i
wholeheartedly sp agree  like i said i am just assuming that more
bullets andor bigger bullets is better  once again though i want to
state that i am a progun individual and do not believe that gun control
is really a viable option here in the united states regardless of the drivel

hi there

does anyone know why apple has an ambiguous message for
csix hundred and fifty regarding fpu  in all mac price lists i have seen every csix hundred and fifty
has the message fpu optional  i know from what we have discussed in this
newsgroup that all csix hundred and fifty have the fpu built in except the foureighty
configuration  why would they be so unclear about this issue in their
price list
i am planning to buy the csix hundred and fifty eighttwo hundred and thirtycd pretty soon but i am now getting
confused with whether it comes with fpu or not
why say optional if it is built in
please anybody help me understand this game

regards

thian

if you get the centris six hundred and fifty with cd configuration you are getting a mac with
a sixtyeightrcforty processor that has builtin math coprocessor support  my 
understanding is that the optional fpu refers to your option of purchasing
the centris six hundred and fifty foureighty without fpu or one of the other configurations with fpu

apple does not offer an upgrade from the nonfpu system to become an fpu
system  and it is unclear whether the forty processor on the nonfpu system
a sixtyeightlcforty can be replaced with a sixtyeightrcforty supplied by another vendor
apple did send a memo out at one point sating that the centris six hundred and ten which only
comes with a nonfpu sixtyeightlcforty processor cannot be upgraded to support an fpu 
the pin configurations of the two chips apparently do not match so you cannot
swap one for another again according to apples memo

hope that helps

of course the list has to agree with the nickname laws laid down by the
gipu almost two thousand years ago you know the nine of them that were written on
the iron tablets that melted once and had to be reinscribed  since i am
a prophet of the gipu i decree that you should post the whole list of
nicknames for the frequent posters here

if the first rule of humor is never having to say you are sorry then the 
second rule must be never having to explain yourself  few things are 
worse that a joke explained  in spite of this and because of requests
for me to post my list of nicknames i must admit that no such list
exists  it was simply a plot device along with me being the keeper
of the list to make the obvious play on the last name of fuller and to
advance the idea that such a list should be made

i assumed that the old timers would recognize it for what it is  
nevertheless how about a list of nicknames for altatheism posters
if you think of a good one just post it and see if others like it
we could start with those posters who annoy us the most like bobby or

 how about people who are not religous  take the inner city  there are
 many people that care little for religion  lot of crime  lot of
 murder  this is the other end lack of religion that allows wrong to
 happen

i lived in tokyo for a year and a half and one of the many reasons why
i intend to go back indefinitely is the freedom one enjoys when one can
walk anywhere and i mean anywhere at any time of day or night and not
feel uneasy even if ones from an ethnic minority as i was

clues for bobby why do i bother i tokyo is a city and inner tokyo
is an inner city ii there is a negligible level of violent crime and
a street murder will be a lead item on national tv news iii the
population is almost universally atheistic

next time i go for a stroll around beirut at night i will let you know how
it compares

hi

while running the ms quick c compiler in a dos window under windows threeone 
this evening i got a program has violated system integrity close all 
applications exit windows and restart your computer error

i started to do this when i immediately got a serious disk error message
from windows  hit return to retry  i did that about five times and then
rebooted to find that quite a few files have been corrupted somehow
i am including the chkdsk output below

questions

one  is there an easy way to restore everything to working order
what might be some better approaches

two  what might have caused this  does the smartdrv cache make me more
vulnerable  i am suspicious of hard drive caches especially when they
cache data writing

the straightforward approach would be to run chkdsk with the f option to 
fix the disk and then it looks like i would probably have to reinstall windows
and a few other things

thanks for your comments and suggestions

more now then ever if they blast away a few good fokes then that is

with the arms build up in waco they needed to hit that compound with

i hope this is a joke if not here is my response

the batf has a history of noknock raids with poor evidence often resulting in
innocent people being killed or suffering injury to person or property  i will
not support the batf until they clean up their act maybe  as to equipment
the batf has damn near anything it wants  their faults were in intelligence
military and civilian definitions apply tactics attacking during daylight methodology the fbi stated that it is against government policy to assault
a position where there are noncombatantspotential hostages without attempting
negotiations first and legality  the batfs jurisdiction is taxes on firearms
and tobacco  they are a branch of the department of the treasury  they have
very curiously backed away from their claims of illegal weaponry to push the
childabuse charges the batf has no jurisdiction over nonfirearmstobacco
issues and the charges of childabuse had been investigated in the past with
no violence and no validation  this was a clear case of first the batf then
the fbi having watched too many rambo movies  my opinion is that the agent
in charge should be charged with executing an illegal raid criminal negligence
murder civil rights violations and breaking hisher oath to uphold and defend
the constitution of the us  the warrant should be unsealed to reveal to the 
public what justification the batf thought it had in committing an armed assault
on american citizens  and while on the issue of investigating this issue
the randy weaver case and the johnny lawmaster case should be investigated for
batf wrongdoing

what gives isreal the right to keep jeruseleum  it is the home of

	israel has a right to keep jerusalem for many reasons  they
include the fact that the majority of the citizens are israeli the
fact that israel maintains religious freedom for all people and the
historical connection of judaism to jerusalem

	when jerusalem was devided by a jordanian invasion in one thousand nine hundred and fortyeight
the cease fire agreement included the right of individuals to visit
religious shrines  this cease fire agreement was violated by jordan
who did not allow jews to visit holy sites under their control  the
jordanians also bulldozed every synagoge in the city  they turned a
jewish cemetary into a hotel and used the gravestones in their
latrines

	israel has allowed individuals of all religions into
jerusalem protected holy sites and demonstrated its fitness to
control the city

	also i should point out that islam is not centered in
jerusalem but has holy sites there  the home of islam is mecca
where all muslims should make a pilgramage the hajj  unlike israeli

andysailstanfordedu andy freeman says

clue  kratz position is not a defense against inaccuracy

i oppose gun control because it does not work  if it did i would support
it  in fact i supported gun control before i did my homework

there is no demand for progun people who do not know what they are
talking about  in fact they would be much better off if they did not say
anything

and why is this freeman  even if a progun person does not know what they are
talking about there is always the possibility that they will learn a thing or
two  i am and will continue to post even if people get angry with what i have
to say  i have several good sources of material now that i know where to look
so calm down

there is lots of information flowing on tpg for those interested in
learning  one can participate in those discussions without ranting
inaccurately  failure to do so has consequences

ah freeman seems to forget from my statement that i am learning  i have also
asked several of the notsohostile folks on this group for sources of
information to read  do you think freeman that maybe this means i am
interested in learning  i think it does because as you said people who do not
know anything will not be good for the progun because

another good habit to get into is to go readonly for a while to take
the time to figure out how things work

another good habit to get into is to realize that not everyone is you freeman
and accept mistakes  sure maybe it could have been some type of
misinformation being slung by some antigun nut but it was not  i made my
statement to inform everyone of this and everyone who replied said do not worry
about it but also to learn as much as you can  they accepted my mistake and
gave me sources of information and told me to read as much as possible  i have
read several posts of yours and have found them informative  why do not you
give me the same chance

another if the other party can decrypt it does not that mean that someone
else could also i assume that if everyone has a different key the only use

if the penguins get out of the patrick they will win the

i am sure that washington will most definitly throw a rench into the
penguin plans  i am a canucks fan not that i think much of their
chances this year but it seems to me like washington is the only
team that can stop the penguins from winning their next stanley cup

a friend of mine was a regular volunteer blood donor  during surgery he
was given five units of blood and after a suitable recovery time he went
to donate blood at a bloodmobile he was hiv and did not know it

the red cross notified him with a registered letter  that is all  no
counselling no nothing  he died two years ago this week  he left behind

how long ago was this  when i said you would get counselling i meant if
you did it now  long ago practices varied and agencies had to gear
up to provide the counselling

a wife and a fouryearold son  many people have suggested that his wife
should sue the red cross but she would not  she says that without the
blood transfusions he would have died during the surgery


good for her  what we do not need is everyone suing community service
agencies that provide blood that people need  testing is not fool proof
the fact that he got aids from a transfusion if he really did does
not mean the red cross screwed up  prior to one thousand nine hundred and eightythree or so there was not
a good test and a lot of bad blood got through  this was not the fault
of the red cross  when did he get the transfusions

what is new in my opinion friday sixteen april one thousand nine hundred and ninetythree  washington dc

one space billboards is this one the spinoffs we were promised
in one thousand nine hundred and fifty science fiction writer robert heinlein published the
man who sold the moon which involved a dispute over the sale of
rights to the moon for use as billboard nasa has taken the firsteps toward this
 hideous vision of the future  observers were
startled this spring when a nasa launch vehicle arrived at the
pad with schwarzenegger painted in huge block letters on the
side of the booster rockets  space marketing inc had arranged
for the ad to promote arnolds latest movie now space marketing
is working with university of colorado and livermore engineers on
a plan to place a milelong inflatable billboard in lowearth
orbit  nasa would provide contractual launch services however
since nasa bases its charge on seriously flawed cost estimates
wn twentysix mar ninetythree the taxpayers would bear most of the expense this
may look like environmental vandalism but mike lawson ceo of
space marketing told us yesterday that the real purpose of the
project is to help the environment the platform will carry ozone
monitors he explainedadvertising is just to help defray costs


what do you think of this revolting and hideous attempt to vandalize
the night sky it is not even april one anymore
what about light pollution in observations i read somewhere else that
it might even be visible during the day leave alone at night
is nasa really supporting this junk

here is another way of looking at it

when we die we are released from the arc of time and able
to comprehend our lives in toto  to visit each moment in
time sequentially or all at once but not able to alter the
actions thoughts or feelings we hadhavewill have in this 
life

from that perspective i posit that all will have direct knowledge
of god and be able to recognize at each moment of time wether
we were doing what we ought  that the experience of having
lived a life far from god will be an eternal torment  that 
having lived a life of grace will be an eternal joy  that the 
resurrection of the body comes not from any physical reconstitution
of our present forms but knowledge of our present forms by our
fully cognizant souls

as an aside  if we were to be restricted for all time to

on the seventyeightth commemorative anniversary of the turkish genocide of the armenians
we remember those whose only crime was to be armenian in the shadow of an 
emerging turkish protofascist state in their names we demand justice

in april one thousand nine hundred and fifteen the turkish government began a systematically executed 
depopulation of the eastern anatolian homeland of the armenians through a 
genocidal extermination this genocide was to insure that turks exclusively
ruled over the geographic area today called the republic of turkey the 
result onefive million murdered thirty billion dollars of armenian property stolen
and plundered this genocide ended nearly threezero years of armenian civilization
on those lands today the turkish government continues to scrape clean any
vestige of a prior armenian existence on those lands todays turkish
governmental policy is to rewrite the history of the era to manufacture
distortion and generate excuses for their genocide of the armenian people in 
the face of refutation ad nauseam the turkish historical society and cronies 
shamelessly continue to deny that any such genocide occurred this policy 
merely demonstrates that in the modern era genocide is an effective state 
policy when it remains unredressed and unpunished a crime unpunished is a 
crime encouraged adolf hitler took this cue less than twentyfive years after the 
successful genocide of the armenians

hi there

i have made a vga mode thirteenh graphics library available via ftp  i originally
wrote the routines as a kind of exercise for myself but perhaps someone
here will find them useful  they are certainly useable as they are but
are missing some higherlevel functionality  they are intended more as an
intro to mode thirteenh programming a starting point

 the library assumes a three hundred and eightysix processor but it is trivial to modify it
 for a two hundred and eightysix  if enough people ask i will make the mods and repost it as a
 different version

the routines are written in assembly tasm and are callable from c  they
are fairly simple but i have found them to be very fast for my purposes
anyway  routines are included to enter and exit mode thirteenh define a
virtual screen put and get pixels put a pixmap rectangular image with
no transparent spots put a sprite image with seethru areas copy
areas of the virtual screen into video memory etc  i have also included a
simple c routine to draw a line as well as a c routine to load a two hundred and fiftysix
color gif image into a buffer  i also wrote a quickndirtytm demo program
that bounces a bunch of sprites around behind three windows

the whole package is available on spangcamosunbecauseca in pubdosvglzip 
it is zipped with pkzip twofourg

it is completely in the public domain as far as i am concerned  do with
it whatever you like  however it would be nice to get credit where it is due

during the nuclear fission reaction the uranium fuel can get hot enough
to melt when this happens the liquid uranium is pumped to the cooling
tower where it is sprayed into the air 

	nonsense  first the uranium fuel is sealed in zirconium
alloy cylinders which do not melt in any circumstances short of 
major failure of the power plant  second the primary water
that circulates inside the reactor core is never pumped into the
cooling tower it is the secondary water cycle that goes 
through the cooling tower  third liquid uranium would burst
into flame on contact with air

contact with the cool outside air
will condense the mist and it will fall back to the cooling tower floor
there it is collected by a cleaning crew using shop vacs and is then
reformed into pellets for reactor use the next day

	cleaning crew working in a mist of uranium  this is a
toxic heavy metal even if it were not radioactive  should not there
be some smileys here  or frowneys

message is common in many food we eat including chinese though some oriental
restaurants might put a tad too much in them  i have noticed that when i
go out and eat in most of the chinese food restaurants i will usually get
a slight headache and an ununsual thirst afterwards  this happens to many
of my friends and relatives too  and heh we eat chinese food all the
time at home  but we do not use message when we are cooking for ourselves

so when we put one and one together it can be safely assumed that
message may cause some allergic reactions in some people

stick with natural things  message does not do body any good and possibly
harms for that matter  so why bother with it  taste food as it should
be tasted and do not cloud the flavor with an imaginary cloak of message

as i understood it message is natural  is not it found in 
tomatoes

anyway lots of people are terribly allergic to lots of natural
things peanuts onions tomatoes milk etc  just because something
is natural does not mean it will not because problems with some folks

as for how foods taste  if i am not allergic to message and i like
the taste of it why should not i use it  saying i should not use
it is like saying i should not eat spicy food because my neighbor
has an ulcer

people have long modified the taste of food by additives whether
they be chiles black pepper salt cream sauces etc  all of these
things cloud the flavor of the food  why do we bother with them
how should food be tasted  is not it better left to the diner

i have found jewish people very imagentative and creative jewish religion was the foundation for christianity and
islam  in other words judaism has fathered both religions now islam has turned against its father i may say
it is ironic that after communizem threat is almost gone religion wars are going to be on the raise 
i thought the idea of believing on one god was to unite all man kind how come both jews and islam which believe
on the same god the god of ebrahim are killing each other is this like dr frankenstiens story
how are you going to stop this from happening how are you going to deal with so many muslims nuking them 
would distroy the whole world would god get mad since you have killed his followers you believe on the same
god same heaven and the same hell after all what is the peacefull way of ending this saga


man kind needs religion since it sets up the rules and the regulations which keeps the society in a healthy state
a religion is mostly a sets of rules which people have experienced and know it works for the society
the praying keeps the sole healthy and meditates it god does not care for man kinds pray but man kind hopes
that god will help him when he prays
religion works mostly on the moral issues and trys to put away the materialistic things in the life but the 
religious leaders need to make a living through religion so they  may corrupt it or turn it to their own way to
make their living ie muslims have to pay  twenty percent of their income to the mullahs i guess the rabie  gets his
cut too 

is in it that religion should be such that everybody on planet earth respects each other be good toward each other
helps one another respect the mother nature is in that heaven and hell are created on earth through the acts 
that we take today  is in it that within every man there is good and bad he could choose either one then he will
see the outcome of his choice  how can we prevent man kind from going crazy over religion how can we stop
another religious killing field under poor gods name what are your thoughts do you think man kind would
to come its senses before it is too late


ps on the side

do you think that moses saw the god on mount sina why would god go to top of the mountain he created
the earth he could have been anywhere why on top the mountain was it because people thought to see god
you have to reach to the skiesheavens why god kept coming back to middle east was it because they created
god through their imagination  is that why jewish people were told by god they were the chosen ones

profit mohammad was married to khadijeh she was a jewish she taught him how to trade she probably taught
him about judaism quran is mostly copy right of taurah sp old testement do you think god wrote quran
makeh was a trade city before islam do you think it was made to be the center of islamic world because mohammad
wanted to expand his trade business is that why  god has put his house in there 

i think this religious stuff has gone too far all man kind are going to hurt from it if they do not wise up
look at david koresh how that turned out i am afraid in the bigger scale the jews and the muslims will
have the same ending

religion is needed in the sense to keep people in harmony and keep them doing good things rather than
plotting each others distruction  there is one earth one life and one god let us all man kind be good toward
each other

god help us all

   the original question was about who started the fire and whether the 
    madmen were inside or outside the compound  to which i replied on 
    the possible sanity level of those inside and outside

was that your argument  well you did not make it very well  you started 
from the questionable premise that the fire was necessarily an act of
insanity rather than an act of negligence or an accident  recall one
survivor claims that the fire started when a tank knocked over a kerosene 
lamp  kind of makes arguments regarding relative sanity somewhat moot no

and another survivor claims he heard someone shouting the fires started
odd terminology  that is what one says when you know a fire is planned not 
when one occurs by accident  we will have to wait and see what the evidence 
shows assuming one is willing to believe any evidence offered by the 
distrustful ones

  according to an australian documentary made in the year before the stand off 
  began koresh and his followers all believed he was christ  koresh 
  had sex with children and women married to other men in the compound  
  these were the perfect children resulting from the great seed of 
  his magnified horn  exmembers describe him in ways not dissimilar 
  to the way jim jones has been described
 
 point noted  have you submitted your faith and sex life for batf clearance
 better hurry i believe the deadline was april fifteen
 
 i paid my taxes  there was no reference to sex or religion on the form
 the comments above and below were meant to address who might be unstable 
 enough to keep children in a building with tear gas or start a fire

nice evasive maneuver mr chekov but they are still on our tail

let me ask it more plainly  which of the above complaints about david 
koreshs religious or sexual proclivities justified an armed raid by the 
bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms

neither  again i was merely addressing the sanity level of the players  
i agree that the batf handled the affair badly from day one  by the way i heard 
on the news today that the affadavit behind the noknock warrant was unsealed 
today  grenade launcher was the only thing on the list that i found 
unusual

  two of the nine who escaped the compound said the fire was deliberately set 
  by cult members

  so when they talk to the news reporters directly and relate the same details 
  will you believe them

 believe them  i will not even recognize them  and neither will anyone else
 who does not know them personally

 do you believe they would put impostors before the national tv cameras

it is not entirely farfetched  nobody outside the compound would know 
everybody inside the compound  do not forget the batf admits having 
agents inside the compound in any case

ambitious news reporters could use the documentary filmed by an australian 
in one thousand nine hundred and ninetytwo on the compound grounds to help identify survivors  i for one 
will check their stories for consistency with what i learned in a long 
news story about that documentary

 at this point we are getting conflicting reports from the survivors
 best wait til more light is she would upon them  of course this is no 
 good if you believe in eternal darkness

i am simply being the devils advocate  there is reasonable doubt by the
boatload standing in the way of anybody totally swallowing the official 
government story on waco

certainly there is some room for doubt  i certainly reserve the right 
to change my opinions when new evidence warrants such a change  if i 
were conspiratorially minded however i would never be able to change 
my mind because any evidence i disliked would have to be a lie 
fabricated by the distrustful ones

the package for only fifteen  also consider offering an inexpensive

very similar in the approach  send in your money and you get 
documentation and a free upgrade to the latest version  perhaps even 
support of some small degree  whatever you want to offer that is better 
than the circulating version

you are lucky if only twenty of the instances of your program in use

it does not really hurt legit users  shareware is still much cheaper than

 swatikas were also common in american indian markingspainted walls etc  is
 it the swastika that is bad  
 
 just want to back this up with a personal anecdote  my grandparents
 have a navajo rug made in the one thousand nine hundred and twentys which they received in trade 
 from the weaver while living in flagstaff arizona  the decorative motif
 consists of four large black swastikas one in each corner  what is more the
 color scheme is black white and red  to the casual glance it would
 undoubtedly appear to be a nazi relic of some kind  yet they owned it
 ten years before hitler and the national socialists came to power  
 
 as i recall they took it down in the thirtys and did not feel quite right
 about putting it back up until the sixtys  it still draws comments from 
 those who do not know what it is

having lived played and worked on and near the navajo reservation
for a number of years i can confirm this is an ancient pattern
found in petroglyphs dated eight hundred to one thousand two hundred years old

also the indians never stopped making rugs with this pattern  they
just stopped selling them after the nazis preempted the swastika

note also that the indian versions use both clockwise and
counterclockwise swastikas

ob guns  it is the rare navaho family that does not own a rifle 
they remember being relocated by the us army and do not intend to
do it again  the hopi on the other hand have a dislike for
weapons from my experience  perhaps they just hide them better
from strangers

i would like to digitize the output of a squid magnetometer range ten v
to ten v and do digital signal processing in a computer say a macintosh
ii or a four hundred and eightysix pc  i would like a good sixteen bit adc with good linearity and a
high conversion speed at least fifty khz preferably two hundred khz  other concerns

two  must i use an adc external to my computer to avoid digital noise
     feedback into my sensitive squid electronics

might be a good idea  the resolution you requested is about zerothreemv
in order to get what you have paid for noise level better be lower than
that  it is kind of hard to do it in a noisy box like you can expect
inside a pc

before you pay  for a pc card test it out by sampling a low
distortion sine wave i think there is a sine wave on a cd  digital
domain   there are possibly other low thd sources  run the digitized
waveform through a fft transform and take alook at the noise floor on
the spectrum  that is should give you a good indication of the design
that is what i am doing to test a data acquistion system i have designed
 i got the idea from maxim data sheet

if you can live with fourteen bit resolution i would recommend looking at
the maxone hundred and twentyone from maxim  it is a high speed three hundred and eightkhz complete
sampling ad with dsp interface  the input range is  fivev and it
uses a serial interface which can easily be optically isolated
from the computer to elinimate a major noise source  the analog design
guide i got from them shows a one hundreddb noise level  they claim a seventysevendb
max eightyfive typ thd  looks pretty good for the twelve  one thousand pieces

a evaluation kit is available  might want to give these nice folks a
call  oneeight hundrednine hundred and ninetyeighteight thousand eight hundred or fax four hundred and eightseven hundred and thirtysevenseven thousand one hundred and ninetyfour and four hundred and eight seven hundred and thirtysevenseven thousand six hundred extfour thousand
for application assistance

this assumes that you can build your own das and write your own software
hey you can get the maxone hundred and twentyone as a free sample just by calling the oneeight hundred 

i would appreciate discussion of your personal experience with a mac or pc
based adc system

i would recommend you to find out the resolution that can be gotten out
of your system by looking at the noise level otherwise you might be
throwing out your money

we here at utah state university cooperative extension have been using
wfourwg for a while now  we wanted to talk to the internet with the mail
package so we got the smtp gateway  you also need a tcpip transport
package on top of that which is utterly stupid but that is what they
require to get the smtp gateway to work  you need a dedicated pc
for the gateway and if you are looking at remote access you need another
dedicated pc for the remote mail stuff  we do not have the remote mail
going but you indicate that that is what you want to do  

there is a glitch somewhere in the system though  i do not know if it
is ms mail the gateway or the vax here on campus that is choking in the
mail that is sent  the scenario is this  the outgoing mail goes to a
unix system which then routes the mail where it needs to go  if that mail
is routed to the vax the vax has problems some times receiving the mail
most messages do get through this way except if someone has there mail
on the vax forwarded to some other location  that is the main gotcha
where ever the mail is forwarded to that person gets a message header
then a message saying boudary error garbage code stuff  if you
can stay away from sending to a vax you are ok  the system people
of course say that the vax is not the problem the gateway is probably
the problem  if anyone wants to get help it is only one hundred and seventyfivezero for one
support call until problem is worked out  phooey to that i say  i
am looking vigorously for a better idea  

if you go forward on any of this and find out anything knew  please

add to this the outrageous cost of putting someone to death special cell
block years of court costs extra guards and the benefits of the death
penalty entirely disappear
 
 that is because of your earlier claim that the one innocent death
 overrides the benefit of all the others  obviously it is tragic  but
 it is no argument for doing away with the death penalty  if we went
 to war and worried about accidentally killing civilians all of the time
 because our determination of who the enemy really is is imperfect then
 there is no way to win the war
 
 yes  fortunately we have rightthinking folks like your good self in power
 and it was therefore deemed acceptable to slaughter tens or even hundreds of
 thousands of iraqis in order to liberate oilhhhkuwait  we won the war
 hurrah hurrah

the number of civilian iraqi deaths were way overexaggerated and 
exploited for antiwar emotionalism by the liberal news media  the
facts are that less iraqis died in the gulf war than did civilians 
in any other war of comparable size this century  this was due mostly
to the short duration coupled with precise surgical bombing techniques
which were technically possible only recently

the idea that hundreds of thousands of iraqi citizens died is
ludicrous  not even hundreds of thousands of iraqi soldiers died
and they were the ones being targeted  or do you think that the us
and its allies were specifically out to kill and maim iraqi civilians
either the smart bombs did not hit their targets and we know they did
or they were targeting civilian targets  which is hardly condusive to
destroying iraqs military potential  the military mission planners are
not fools they know they have to hit military targets to win a war
hitting civilian targets does nothing but unite the people against you
not a laudable goal if one wants the people to rise up against their
tyrantdictator 
 
 ok so some innocent people died  yes maybe the unarmed civilians fleeing
 along that road did not need to be bombed to bits  perhaps that kid with half
 his face burned off and the little girl with the mangled legs were not
 entirely guilty  but it is worth the death of a few innocents to save the
 oilhhhlives of the kuwaiti people is not it  after all the iraqis may
 not have had a chance to vote for saddam but they showed their acceptance of
 his regime by not assassinating him right  all that surrendering and
 fleeing along open roads was just a devious ploy  we were entirely within
 our rights to bomb them just in case without finding out if they were
 soldiers

how about all the innocent people who died in blanketbombing in wwtwo
i do not hear you bemoaning them  war is never an exact science but
with smart bombs it is becoming more exact with a smaller percentage
of civilian casualties  sometimes mistakes are made targets are
misidentified innocents die  that is war the way it really is
but the alternative to allow tyrannical dictators to treat the earth
like it is one big rummage sale grabbing everything they can get is
worse  like patrick henry said some two hundred and seventeen years ago i know not what
course others may take  but as for me give me liberty or give me
death  war is always the price one must be willing to pay if one
wishes to stay free   

 
 the death penalty was conceived as a deterrent to crime  but the legal
 shenanigans that have been added automatic appeals lengthy court
 battles etc have relegated that purpose to a very small part of what
 it should be  hence the question is  do we instate the death penalty as
 it was meant to be and see if that deters crime or do we get rid of
 it entirely
 
 yes let us reinstate the death penalty the way it ought to be  all that shit
 about fair trials and a court of appeals just gets in the way of justice 
 let us give the police the absolute right to gun down the guilty and save
 ourselves the expense of all those lawyers
 
 think of the knockon benefits too  la would never have had to spend so
 much money cleaning up after riots and holding showcase trials if the cops
 had been allowed to do their job properly  a quick bullet through the head
 of rodney king and another for the cameraman and everyone would have been
 saved a great deal of unnecessary paperwork and expense
 
 after all if the police decide a mans guilty that ought to be enough  the
 fact that the death penalty has been shown not to have any deterrent effect
 over imprisonment well that is entirely irrelevant
 
 
 mathew
  

mathew your sarcasm is noted but you are completely offbase here
you come off sounding like a complete peacenik idiot although i
feel sure that was not your intent

so the iraqi war was wrong eh  i am sure that appeasement would have
worked better than war just like it did in wwtwo eh  i guess we
should not have fought wwtwo either  just think of all those innocent
german civilians killed in dresden and hamburg  how about all the poor 
french who died in the crossfire because we invaded the continent  we 
should have just let hitler take over europe and you would be speaking
german instead of english right now

tyrants like hussein have to be stopped  his kind do not understand
diplomacy they only understand the point of a gun  my only regret is
that bush wimped out and did not have the military roll into baghdad so
now hussein is still in power and the iraqi peoples sacrifice not to
mention the three hundred and fiftyseven americans who died was for naught  liberating kuwait 
was a good thing but wiping hussein off the map would have been better

and as for poor poor rodney king  did you ever stop and think why
the jury in the first trial brought back a verdict of not guilty
those who have been foaming at the mouth for the blood of those
policemen certainly have looked no further than the video tape
but the jury looked at all the evidence evidence which you and i
have not seen  when one makes a judgment without the benefit of a
trial where evidence can be presented on both sides one has simply
lowered himself to the level of vigilante justice a stateofmind
which your sarcasm above seemingly spoke against but instead tends
to support in the case against the policemen  

law in this country is intended to protect the rights of the accused
whether they be criminals or cops  one is not found guilty if there is
a reasonable doubt of ones guilt and only the jury is in a position
to assess the evidence and render a verdict  anyone else is simply
succumbing to verbal vigilantism

i experienced a sudden numbness in my left arm this morning  just after
i completed my fourth set of deep squats  today was my weight training
day and i was just beginning my routine  all of a sudden at the end of
the fourth set my arm felt like it had gone to sleep  it was cold turned pale
and lost sixty of its strength  the weight i used for squats was not that
heavy i was working hard but not at one hundred effort  i waited for a few 
minutes trying to shake the arm back to life and then continued with
chest exercises flyes with lighter dumbells than i normally use  but
i dropped the left dumbell during the first set and experienced continued
arm weakness into the second  so i quit training and decided not to do my
usual hour on the ski machine either  i will take it easy for the rest of
the day

my arm is still somewhat numb and significantly weaker than normal 
my hand still tingles a bit down to the thumb color has returned to normal
and it is no longer cold 

horrid thoughts of chunks of plaque blocking a major artery course through
my brain  i am thirtyfour vegetarian and pretty fit from my daily exercise
regimen  so that cannot be it  could a pinched nerve from the bar
because these symptoms i hope

it likely has nothing to do with chunks of plaque but it sounds like
you may have a neurovascular compromise to your arm and you need medical
attention before doing any more weight lifting

   actually i must also ask the faqs one most popular reason why graphics
   do not show up do you wait for an expose event before drawing your
   rectangle

suppose you have an idle app with a realized and mapped window that contains
xlib graphics  a button widget when pressed will cause a new item
to be drawn in the window  this action clearly should not call xcopyarea 
or equiv directly instead it should register the existence of the new
item in a memory structure and let the expose event handler take care
of rendering the image because at that time it is guaranteed that the
window is mapped

the problem of course is that no expose event is generated if the window
is visible and mapped  do you know the best way to tickle a window so
that the expose event handler will be invoked to draw this new item


what does this have to do with my original question  i previously
stated that i did an xcopyarea of the deptheight pixmap to the screen
just to make sure that my image had data and it did  this is not
a problem with expose events it has to do with xcopyplane not
working

does anyone have a code fragment they could send demonstrating that
xcopyplane works  this would be very helpful

 what are you talking about  the rabin government has clearly
 indicated its interest in a territorial compromise that would leave
 the vast majority of the arabs in judea samaria and gaza outside
 israeli control

just an interrupting comment here since early one thousand nine hundred and eightys  israelis said they are 
willing to give up the adminstration rule of the occupied terretories to
palestineans palestineans refused and will refuse such settlement that denies
them their right of selfdetermination period

 i know i was just pointing out that not compromising may be a bad idea and
 there are in israel voices against negotiations and i think there are many
 among palestineans also against any negociations 
 
 just an opinion

 dorin

ok i donot know why there are israeli voices against negotiations however
i would guess that is because they refuse giving back a land for those who
have the right for it

as for the arabian and palestinean voices that are against the
current negotiations and the socalled peace process they
are not against peace per se but rather for their wellfounded predictions
that israel would not give an inch of the west bank and most probably the same
for golan heights back to the arabs an eighteen months of negotiations in madrid
and washington proved these predictions now many will jump on me saying why
are you blaming israelis for noresult negotiations
i would say why would the arabs stall the negotiations what do they have to
loose 

arabs feel that the current negotiations is only for legitimizing the current
statusquo and for opening the doors of the arab markets for israeli trade and
oranges that is simply unacceptable and would be revoked

subject re there is a good deal more confusion here   you started off with the 
assertion that there was some objective morality and as you admit
here you finished up with a recursive definition   murder is 
objectively immoral but eactly what is murder and what is not itself
requires an appeal to morality

yes

now you have switch targets a little but only a little   now you are
asking what is the goal   what do you mean by goal   are you
suggesting that there is some objective goal out there somewhere
and we form our morals to achieve it

well for example the goal of natural morality is the survival and
propogation of the species  another example of a moral system is
presented within the declaration of independence which states that we
should be guaranteed life liberty and the pursuit of happiness  you see
to have a moral system we must define the purpose of the system  that is
we shall be moral unto what end

murder is certainly a violation of the golden rule  and i thought i had
defined murder as an intentional killing of a nonmurderer against his will
and you responded to this by asking whether or not the execution of an
innocent person under our system of capital punishment was a murder or not
i fail to see what this has to do with anything  i never claimed that our
system of morality was an objective one
i thought that was your very first claim   that there was
some kind of objective morality and that an example of that was
that murder is wrong   if you do not want to claim that any more
that is fine

well murder violates the golen rule which is certainly a pillar of most
every moral system  however i am not assuming that our current system
and the manner of its implementation are objectively moral  i think that
it is a very good approximation but we cannot be perfect

and by the way you do not seem to understand the difference between
arbitrary and objective   if keith schneider defines murder
to be this that and the other that is arbitrary   jon livesey may
still say well according to my personal system of morality all
killing of humans against their will is murder and wrong and what
the legal definition of murder may be in the usa kuweit saudi
arabia or the prc may be matters not a whit to me

well objective would assume a system based on clear and fundamental
concepts while arbitary implies no clear line of reasoning

hello  i am currently designing the architecture of a chip which is
intended to help speed up common operations on a windowing system such as
x  a friend and i are designing the chip as the final course project for
an advanced computer architecture course taught by dr fred brooks at
uncchapel hill  while we feel that we have got a pretty solid design
currently we would really like to get ahold of some frequency data from an
xwindows server so that we can make the most effective use of our bit
budget  

unfortunately i have been unable to find anything of this sort in the
various x faqs or x manuals that i have seen  does anyone have some type of
frequency data like how many copyrectangle operations vs drawlines and
things of that sort  or barring that a program that records requests to
the server into a logfile that i can munge on myself

any and all help would be very appreciated

many thanks

you will notice that i did not mention sweep wings even though the

dirctly from the germans  the difference is that swept wings do not
change their angle of sweep sweep wings do  perhaps the similarity

phil a lot of this was also done by the military

after nasa aerodynamicists proposed them and nasa test teams
demonstrated them  richard whitcomb and rt jones at langley
research center were giants in the field

dryden was involved in the flight testing of winglets and area
ruling in the seventys and fiftys respectively  it is true that we
used military aircraft as the testbeds kcone hundred and thirtyfive and yfone hundred and two but
that had more to do with availability and need than with military
involvement  the yfone hundred and two was completely ours and the kcone hundred and thirtyfive was
bailed to us  the air force of course was interested in our
results and supportive of our efforts

dryden flew the first digital fly by wire aircraft in the seventys no
mechnaical or analog backup to show you how confident we were
general dynamics decided to make the fsixteen flybywire when they saw how
successful we were  mind you the avro arrow and the xfifteen were both
flybywire aircraft much earlier but analog

phil egad i am disagreeing with mary shafer  

the nasa habit of acquiring secondhand military aircraft and using
them for testbeds can make things kind of confusing  on the other
hand all those secondhand navy planes give our test pilots a chance

talk about adding insult to injury  
 
i for one believe that the use of civil forfeiture should be abolished by
a decent administration not continued  instead it looks like that
illgotten gain will be used to help pay for wiretap equipment

i wholeheartedly agree  knowing that we have let our law enforcement agencies
seize our property against the fifth amendment of our constitution tells me that
we are absolving ourselves of our responsibility for selfgovernance  we have
to take our government back from the selfserving politicians who create laws
and rules only to better their positions within the government  we have allowed
them to take too much power from the people of this nation  that situation has
to be changed

allowing the law enforcement agencies to use the seized property to payoff drug
informants who lie and continue to deal in drugs is tantamount to making a pact
with the devil himself  it is a vicious cycle  the law enforcement agencies are
motivated to seize property to fund their own activities  and having no easy
way for the citizen to regain the property intact once taken gives even more
incentive for the agencies to take property

it is also interesting to note that two months ago rush limbaugh said that
clinton would have the plumbers out in force shortly  clinton and his
henchmen firmly believe in strong ubiquitous government control  anytime a
leader believes in that the leader will use every means possible to retain that
control and take more

we have to take our government back  otherwise we will end up living in the
equivalent of a hightech third world dictatorship  we have to take
responsibility for ourselves our personal welfare and our actions

i am posting to this group in hopes of finding someone out there in
network newsland who has heard of something similar to what i am going
to describe here  i have a fourteen year old daugter who experienced
a seizure on november three one thousand nine hundred and ninetytwo at sixfortyfiveam after eating kellogs frosted
flakes  she is perfectly healthy had never experienced anything like
this before and there is no history of seizures in either side of the
family  all the tests eeg mri ekg came out negative so the decision
was made to do nothing and just wait to see if it happened again

well we were going along fine and the other morning april five she had
a bowl of another kellogs frosted kind of cereal fruit loops i am
embarrassed to admit that i even bought that junk but every once
in a while so i pour it in her bowl and think oh oh this is the
same kind of junk she was eating when she had that seizure  ten 
minutes later she had a full blown seizures this was her first exposure
to a sugar coated cereal since the last seizure

when i mentioned what she ate the first time as a possible reason for
the seizure the neurologist basically negated that as an idea  now
after this second episode so similar in nature to the first even
he is scratching his head  once again her eeg looks normal which i
understand can happen even when a person has a seizure

once again we are waiting i have been thinking that it would be good
to get to as large a group as possible to see if anyone has any
experience with this kind of thing  i know that members of the medical
community are sometimes loathe to admit the importance that diet and
foods play in our general health and wellbeing  anyway as you can
guess i am worried sick about this and would appreciate any ideas
anyone out there has  sorry to be so wordy but i wanted to really get

 what is cryptology cryptography plaintext ciphertext encryption key

  the story begins when julius caesar sent messages to his trusted
  acquaintances he did not trust the messengers so he replaced every a
  by a c every b by a d and so on through the alphabet only someone
  who knew the shift by two rule could decipher his messages

  a cryptosystem or cipher system is a method of disguising messages so
  that only certain people can see through the disguise cryptography is
  the art of creating and using cryptosystems cryptanalysis is the art
  of breaking cryptosystemsseeing through the disguise even when
  you are not supposed to be able to cryptology is the study of both
  cryptography and cryptanalysis

  the original message is called a plaintext the disguised message is
  called a ciphertext encryption means any procedure to convert
  plaintext into ciphertext decryption means any procedure to convert
  ciphertext into plaintext

  a cryptosystem is usually a whole collection of algorithms the
  algorithms are labelled the labels are called keys for instance
  caesar probably used shift by n encryption for several different
  values of n it is natural to say that n is the key here

  the people who are supposed to be able to see through the disguise are
  called recipients other people are enemies opponents interlopers
  eavesdroppers or third parties

 what references can i start with to learn cryptology

  for an introduction to technical matter the survey articles given
  in part ten are the best place to begin as they are in general
  concise authored by competent people and well written however
  these articles are mostly concerned with cryptology as it has
  developed in the last fifty years or so and are more abstract and
  mathematical than historical the codebreakers by kahn kahsixtyseven is
  encyclopedic in its history and technical detail of cryptology up
  to the midsixtys

  introductory cryptanalysis can be learned from gaines gaifortyfour or
  sinkov sinsixtysix this is recommended especially for people who want
  to devise their own encryption algorithms since it is a common
  mistake to try to make a system before knowing how to break one

  the selection of an algorithm for the des drew the attention of
  many public researchers to problems in cryptology consequently
  several textbooks and books to serve as texts have appeared the
  book of denning deneightytwo gives a good introduction to a broad range
  of security including encryption algorithms database security
  access control and formal models of security similar comments
  apply to the books of price  davies prieightyfour and pfleeger pfleightynine

  the books of konheim koneightyone and meyer  matyas meyeightytwo are quite
  technical books both konheim and meyer were directly involved in
  the development of des and both books give a thorough analysis of
  des konheims book is quite mathematical with detailed analyses
  of many classical cryptosystems meyer and matyas concentrate on
  modern cryptographic methods especially pertaining to key management
  and the integration of security facilities into computer systems and
  networks

  the books of rueppel rueeightysix and koblitz kobeightynine concentrate on
  the application of number theory and algebra to cryptography

 how does one go about cryptanalysis

  classical cryptanalysis involves an interesting combination of
  analytical reasoning application of mathematical tools pattern
  finding patience determination and luck the best available
  textbooks on the subject are the military cryptanalytics series
  frieone it is clear that proficiency in cryptanalysis is for
  the most part gained through the attempted solution of given
  systems such experience is considered so valuable that some of the
  cryptanalyses performed during wwii by the allies are still
  classified

  modern publickey cryptanalysis may consist of factoring an integer
  or taking a discrete logarithm these are not the traditional fare
  of the cryptanalyst computational number theorists are some of the
  most successful cryptanalysts against public key systems

 what is a bruteforce search and what is its cryptographic relevance

  in a nutshell if fx  y and you know y and can compute f you can
  find x by trying every possible x that is bruteforce search

  example say a cryptanalyst has found a plaintext and a corresponding
  ciphertext but does not know the key he can simply try encrypting the
  plaintext using each possible key until the ciphertext matchesor
  decrypting the ciphertext to match the plaintext whichever is faster
  every welldesigned cryptosystem has such a large key space that this
  bruteforce search is impractical
    
  advances in technology sometimes change what is considered
  practical for example des which has been in use for over ten years
  now has twofiftysix or about tenseventeen possible keys a computation with
  this many operations was certainly unlikely for most users in the
  midseventys the situation is very different today given the dramatic
  decrease in cost per processor operation massively parallel
  machines threaten the security of des against brute force search
  some scenarios are described by garron and outerbridge garninetyone

  one phase of a more sophisticated cryptanalysis may involve a
  bruteforce search of some manageably small space of possibilities

 what are some properties satisfied by every strong cryptosystem

  the security of a strong system resides with the secrecy of the key
  rather than with an attempt to keep the algorithm itself secret

  a strong cryptosystem has a large keyspace as mentioned above  the
  unicity distance is a measure which gives the minimum amount of
  ciphertext that must be intercepted to uniquely identify the key and
  if for some key the unicity distance is much longer than the amount
  of ciphertext you intend to encrypt under that key the system is
  probably strong

  a strong cryptosystem will certainly produce ciphertext which appears
  random to all standard statistical tests see for example caeninety
    
  a strong cryptosystem will resist all known previous attacks a
  system which has never been subjected to scrutiny is suspect

  if a system passes all the tests mentioned above is it necessarily
  strong certainly not many weak cryptosystems looked good at first
  however sometimes it is possible to show that a cryptosystem is
  strong by mathematical proof if joe can break this system then
  he can also solve the wellknown difficult problem of factoring
  integers see part six  failing that it is a crap shoot

 if a cryptosystem is theoretically unbreakable then is it
  guaranteed analysisproof in practice

  cryptanalytic methods include what is known as practical
  cryptanalysis the enemy does not have to just stare at your
  ciphertext until he figures out the plaintext for instance he might
  assume cribsstretches of probable plaintext if the crib is
  correct then he might be able to deduce the key and then decipher the
  rest of the message or he might exploit isologsthe same
  plaintext enciphered in several cryptosystems or several keys thus
  he might obtain solutions even when cryptanalytic theory says he
  does not have a chance

  sometimes cryptosystems malfunction or are misused the onetime pad
  for example loses all security if it is used more than once even
  chosenplaintext attacks where the enemy somehow feeds plaintext into
  the encryptor until he can deduce the key have been employed see
  kahsixtyseven
  
 why are many people still using cryptosystems that are
  relatively easy to break

  some do not know any better often amateurs think they can design
  secure systems and are not aware of what an expert cryptanalyst
  could do and sometimes there is insufficient motivation for anybody
  to invest the work needed to crack a system

furthermore the big bucks approach to science promotes what i think is
one of the most significant errors in science  choosing to investigate
questions because they can be readily handled by the currently
fashionable methodology or because one can readily get institutional
or corporate sponsorship for them instead of directing attention to
those questions which seem to have fundamental significance

shades of james watson  that is exactly the way many workers have described
their misgivings about the human genome project  if you take a rigid 
definition of scientific research the mere accumulation of data is not 
doing science  one of the early arguments against the project were that the 
resources would be better used to focus on specific geneticsrelated 
problems rather than just going off and collecting maps and sequence  
the project cannot be so narrowly defined or easily described now though

subject re is key escrow enough
lines twentyfour

	  the points raised about checking what is actually in the chip as
	opposed to what is allegedly programmed therein raise yet another trust
	issue  even if we assume that these trusted agents are really entering
	a wide range of sone and stwo seeds rather than using the same one all the
	time to reduce the key search space to thirty bits i assume they are not
	doing so by picking up an iron filing and poking it into the circuitry
	at carefully selected points to encode data  they would presumably be
	punching numbers into a computer which for all they know could program
	the chips in a manner completely independent of the sone and stwo values they
	are feeding into the system

sone and stwo are clearly the backdoor  we should assume they are all
compromised  if they are not compromisable why the hell not use a
hardware true random number source  there is not a random number
source anywhere in this proposal  the whole thing is deterministic
from the day the serial number is stamped on the chip

nope it cannot be trusted  this is all about two levels of access 
the possibly honest key escrow that police forces have to use and
ostensibly the fbi and the back door that let us the nsa decode everything
on the fly  and maybe some backhanders to the fbi when they want a
warrantless tab in exchange for favours

  here is how i talk to nonchristians who are complaining about hell

me	do you believe you are going to heaven
him	i do not believe in heaven
me	so are you going there
him	if there was a heaven i would
me	but since there is not a heaven you are not going there are you
him	no

  the point is that heaven is based on faithif you do not believe in heaven
there is no way you are going to be in it

    hmmm people in the americas before the time of christ children who
die young etc 


  of course the next step is i do not believe in hell either so why will i
be there  it seems to me that hell is eternal death and seperation from god


   but of course the popular conception of hell correct or incorrect is
something akin to eternal perpetuation of consciousness at the very least


most atheists do believe that when they die they will die forever and never
see godso they do in fact believe that they are going to hell

   i think a good number of atheists believe there is nothing beyond 
bodily death but it is simply an abuse of language to say they believe
they are going to hell they believe they are going to die understand
that you have turned hell into a verb using the same logic it also follows
that all animals are going to hell are you sure this is what you want
to say presumably animals do not have the opportunity to get to heaven
but this still does not change the fact that they are going to hell die
a final death

   i do not claim to know whether or not there is an afterlife of some
sort but if hell is as you described final death and
not eternal perpetuation of consciousness it will be true that
there will never be a moment when i am aware of my nonexistence 
assuming i go to hell and not to heaven in other words i will
never know i am dead hmmm 


  hell does not have to be worse than earth to be hellbecause it is eternal

    ever hear people say of a loved one who was ill and has died
 at least she is not suffering any more she is in heaven now 

    consider the following statement
 at least she is not suffering any more she is in hell now

    the above statement sounds odd but according to your definition of hell 
it would be a true statement the person in hell would not be suffering 
granted they would not be anything would not be having any
conscious experience whatsoever 

    you say hell death is eternal however this loses its meaning 
to a dead person and to me it seems that the threat of some sort 
of eternal punishment only makes sensehas force if one expects to
be conscious throughout this eternity 

    many atheists believe that the thirst for an afterlife is simply the
product of propaganda friend do you want the free gift of eternal life
it is my understanding that the early jews did not believe in an afterlife
can anyone back me up on this combined with the survival instinct all
animals share the difference is we have consciousness and once we get the
idea of eternal life drilled into our brains we then desire a sort of
supersurvival 

 
and it is a lot worse than heaven  that is the only comparison that matters

    that would depend on what heaven is like if god is a king and 
an eternity in heaven consists of giving thanks and praise to the king
i might opt for hell i read a lovely account of a missionary trying to
convert eskimos to christianity in the book the illusion of immortality
by corliss lamont the missionary started to speak about heaven 
are there seals in heaven will we be able to go hunting asked an
eskimo the missionary said no the group of eskimos then said something
to the effect of well what good is your heaven if there is no hunting
scram i highly recommend the above book ioi to anyone who wants an
account of the other side of the immortality coin that there is no 
immortality

a lot of stuff deleted

      for that matter stay biblical and call it omar rasheet the feast of
 first fruits  torah commands that this be observed on the day following
 the sabbath of passover week  sunday by any other name in modern
 parlance  why is there so much objection to observing the resurrection
 on the onest day of the week on which it actually occured  why jump it all
 over the calendar the way easter does  why not just go with the sunday
 following passover the way the bible has it  why seek after unbiblical
 methods
  
in fact that is the reason easter jumps all over the calendar passsover
itself is a lunar holiday not a solar one and thus falls over a wide
possible span of times  the few times that easter does not fall during or
after passover are because easter is further linked to the vernal equinox
the beginning of spring

more deletions
  
       so what does this question have to do with easter the whore
 goddess  i am all for celebrating the resurrection  just keep that
 whore out of the discussion
  
your obsession with the term whore clouds your argument  whore is
a value judgement not a descriptive term

more deletions

overall this argument is an illustration of the etymological fallacy
see jp louw semantics of nt greek  that is the idea that the true
meaning of a word lies in its origins and linguistic form  in fact our
own experience demonstrates that the meaning of a word is bound up with
how it is used not where it came from  very few modern people would
make any connection whatsoever between easter and ishtar  if daniel
seagard does then for him it has that meaning  but that is a highly
idiosyncratic meaning and not one that needs much refutation

hello mr au

i have to disagree regarding your assessment of macintosh in hong kong the mac has a sizeable share of the typesetting market as in the yous a local magazine next magazine similar to newsweek here uses the mac extensively i have seen sir speedy and other franchises in hong kong equipped with macbased systems true the discount is not as steep as here because customers in hong kong cannot buy from gray market nor are mac being sold thru mass merchandisers like apple does here with the performa lin


e at this point the sale of mac is handled by one exclusive distributor on the other hand you can always get a pc clone or in the earlier days illegal clones of the apple iie

your perception of the mac not being too popular in hong kong is simply because most hobbyists and users find it much cheaper to go to one of those basement stores that sell pc clones with probably illegal copies of bios than to pay for a mac

similarly you cannot say lotus onetwothree surely is not well accepted in hong kong because the sale is so low may be it is because of all those places in kowloon where illegal copies of lotus onetwothree can be bought for twenty and ten for a professional looking but illegal copies of the manuals

hey ed you did not give me the chance  sheesh

the answer is absolutely as ed so eloquently describes

edone who knows what he is doing and why that will be faster  it may
edbe possible to improve your technique if you have no idea what it is
edthrough trial and error but it is not very effective methodology

herein lies the key to this thread

kindly note the difference in the responses  ed and i are talking
about knowing riding technique while mike is arguing knowing the physics
behind it  it is possible to be taught the technique of countersteering
ie push the bar on the inside of the turn to go that way without
having to learn all the fizziks about gyroscopes and ice cream cones
and such as seen in the parallel thread  that stuff is mainly of interest
to technomotorcycle geeks like the readers of recmotorcycles  
but does not need to be taught to the average student learning csteering
mike does not seem to be able to make the distinction  i know people
who can carve circles around me who could not tell you who newton was
on the other hand i know very intelligent welleducated people who
think that you steer a motorcycle by either one leaning two steering
a la bicycles or three a combination of one and two  knowledge of physics
does not get you squat  knowledge of technique does

subject re ford probe  opinions centered around the gt
organization the santa cruz operation
lines one hundred and twentyseven


jeremy g mereness  says

can anyone offer any opinions of the ford probe ala how they do in
the long run repair records reliability mileage etc

i am fixing to buy a car in the next few months aiming toward something
a little bigger than a typical small car and with a little more power i
am considering the mxsix probe accord corolla and the two hundred and fortysx 

the probe is the youngest of the bunch thus my interest in opinions
but every magazine and ratings book places it as an excellent value
by the way the two hundred and fortysx is rearwheel drive and is due for a redesign for one thousand nine hundred and ninetyfour 

thanks in advance

while i do not read normally read this group i was looking for valentine radar
information sigh maybe in the faq and came across your posting

i bought a ninetythree probe gt with the pep two hundred and sixtythreea last july now at nine thousand five hundred miles
after debating over the sentra sernxtwo thousand mxsix mrtwo stealth prelude 
and celica

check this months consumer reports for previous probe records  

my criteria a fun car with abs airbag over one hundred and thirtyhp and less than twentyfivek
i thought about a turbo but checking with insurance people ruled that out
the tristar cars eclipsetalonetc were out since they do not have an air bag
ditto for the mustangalso no abs
the sernxtwo thousandmtwenty fell into the pocketrocket category  a good used car buy
the mxsix was almost there but rolled more than i liked  
i did not like the prelude dashinstrumentation at all  too weird for me
the mrtwo has a much smaller nonpassenger space than i needed so out that went
the celica was ok but underpowered when loaded with options and somewhat
overpriced too in nonturbo form
i never considered the two hundred and fortysx since it did not have an airbag  i did look at it
for its rwd virtues but that is it  the corolla never entered my mind
i should have looked at the mitsubishi vrfourdodge stealth more
since my list was exhausted i bought the probe  

the car design is different than earlier years so it is too early to see its
reliability so far  for what it is worth my comments

my dislikes
shutting door with windows up from inside rarely makes good wind seal
headlights have stuck up a few times weather
air conditioning broke four thousand miles pressure cycling switch
condensation around rear washer fluid container does not drain completely
crammed engine little hope for doityourselfers typical
parts somewhat more expensive than normal ford parts
underside plastic does not like sharp driveways and speedbumps typical
assembly gripes tape on radiator screw fell out of dash seat seams not 
stitched properly  hopefully just a fluke
ford only gives one key with the car  cmon ford spend an extra few pennies
rear hatch has no padding on corners when up  i am waiting for the day when
i bash my head on the corner
horn buttons behind air bag in spokes and not in center personal preference
tires fling dirtmud onto side of car 

my likes
engine designvalvessoundssmoothnesspowermileagetorque  definitely one
handling very good for fwd understeer only at limits
transmission the five speed is a must
usable instrumentation lovely readable analog everywhere
very little torque steer at full power much better than the ninety sho i drive
stability at one hundredmph high gearing though
low cowl good visibility in front
heated outside mirrors nice in fog never tested in freezing weather
absair bag see above
rear seats fold down i have few rear seat passengers so a trunk not important
no shakerattle noises when going over bumpspotholes still
tires two hundred and twentyfivefiftyfivevrsixteen goodyear eagles seventy left hoping for thirtyk 

as you can see i am primarily interested in the engine  while it does not
have the uummmph of a bigliter car or the turbo rush the big selling
point for me was the allaluminum twentyfour value twofive liter engine  

the overall car is a good buy for the money  that market segment has not changed
much since july prelude vtec honda del sol  i drive it to and from work
each day on relatively smooth roads and most noticable thing is that the
probes suspension does not like potholes  when you test drive one find a 
potholed road somewhere around town and see if the jarring you get is tolerable
if you have three passengers by all means bring them along too  they will find
that they have no room in the back and you will find that the car rides
differently if that is better is up to you  also there is a lot of glass
around you which i was not expecting the temperature inside the car gets pretty
hot in the summer  my back seat passengers now very few complain about
the lack of ventilation you may want to consider that when combined with
the heat  i have heard that the exhaust system has trouble but mine works fine
leather and the keyless entry system were not available when i got the car so
i cannot comment on them i got the car before it was officially announced  
i prefer cloth to leather anyway  

i would not want this car in the snow  the suspension is too rough for the
inevitable surprise potholes tires are not meant for snow and the seats assume
that you are not wearing lots of thick clothing  rain is much better  water 
generally beads off the windshield at freeway speed the windshield wiper
controls are easy and understandable and i barely hydroplaned once with the
eagles and i was really trying  
there is also a definite lack of cup holdersmall storage places  the gt
has map holders below the speakers in the door but they are rigid plastic
that could fit two cassettes or cds max  the center consolestorage binarm
rest has one cup holder and the back of the front seats have a cloth pouch
but that is it  no change holders  quite a letdown from the sho
and the probe is definitely not a peoplemover car or an econobox car

lastly do not store wet car covers in the back  the foam will soak the 
water up and the result will not smell pleasant

subject sharks review part two defensemen twonineteen
organization computer science department stanford university
lines ninetytwo

i finally got it back with great thanks to mark spiegel for saving and sending
it



two	rob zettler		season	fourth
acquired	ninetyoneninetytwo from minnesota in dispersal draft
grade		cc

zettler gave the sharks every bit he is got this year unfortunately this still
was not enough to make him any more than a marginal nhler if that  he works
hard for sure but is no better than average on defense and is prone to
costly penalties and defensive lapses at times while being basically an
offensive zero zero goal and seven assists in seventynine games  he would be hardpressed
to make the team next year

three	david williams		season twond
acquired	ninetyoneninetytwo free agent from new jersey
grade		cc

i am going to williams was the most valuable defenseman for the sharks in ninetyoneninetytwo
playing a combination of good offense three goals and twentyfive assists in fiftysix games and
good defense  but he playing the first part of this season in kansas city
was good neither offensively nor defensively this year it then appears that
ninetyoneninetytwo was a fluke  although he improved towards the end of the season he
was prone to being out of position defensively and did not demonstrate the
playmaking skills that made him the teams leading scorer among defensemen last
year  he would also be hardpressed to make the team next year

four	jayson more		season twond
acquired	ninetyoneninetytwo from montreal in expansion draft
grade		b

after being touted as the teams top defensive prospects in training camp
before ninetyoneninetytwo more had a rather disappointing ninetyoneninetytwo as he was not
particularly good defensively and had just seventeen points in fortysix games  he then
proceeded to improve his game massively this season becoming the teams most
reliable defenseman whom the team can count on night in and night out to play
steady defense and providing occasional but only occasional offensive flash
offensively he was even more disappointing than last year eleven points in seventythree
games but his defense improved tremendously  he is probably best as the
defensive part of a defense combination with an offensive defenseman

five	neil wilkinson		season fourth
acquired	ninetyoneninetytwo from minnesota in dispersal draft
grade		b

wilkinson was probably the teams top defensive defenseman in ninetyoneninetytwo  however
partially because of injuries he was not the same this year as he missed twentyfive
games total due to nagging knee and back injuries and seemed to be slowed
even when playing  he then had often to be saved by his defensive partners
that is if they are there at all  but he also had some solid games and if
he can be complete healthy he can still be a force

six	sandis ozolinsh		season onest
acquired	ninetyoneninetytwo twond round pick in entry draft
grade		i a

at the time of his injury december thirty against the philadelphia flyers
ozolinsh was well on track to be i am going to the teams mvp  a serious knee injury
in that game though forced him to miss the rest of the season fortyseven games
but he still finished as the teams top scorer among defensemen twentythree points
which of course tells more about the lack of offense the sharks had from
their defensemen but it also tells of ozolinshs abilities  at the time he
was playing very good defense along with excellent offense he was still
susceptible to socalled rookie mistakes but was probably the defenseman who
made the least of them on the team rookie or veteran  if he can come back
from his injuries he is ready to be a star

nineteen	doug zmolek		season onest
acquired	ninetyoneninetytwo from minnesota in dispersal draft
grade		b

zmolek had basically a solid and durable year being one of the only two sharks
to play in all eightyfour games of the season  he was solid on defense but
after being billed as an offensive defenseman he did not show it fifteen points
he was also prone to penalties and his two hundred and twentynine penalty minutes was second on the
team however that was also an indication that he was fearly when facing tough
physical opponents and he was at his best when playing physically  but to
become a fixture in this league he needs to improve both offensively and
defensively and cut down on the number of powerplays he gives to opponents

could we plase cease this discussion  i fail to see why people feel the need 
to expound upon this issue for days and days on end  these areas are not
 meant for this type of discussion  if you feel the need to do such things
 please take your thought elsewhere  thanks
 
i just want to second this request i value this net group as one where people
focus on solving problems and go out of their way to be respectful of
differences the hostility expressed in the original posting feels like an
assault 
 
thanks
jan 
 

   exactly my point  there is a lot of hostility to and from teenagers

   look i sent these posts here to altparentsteens with a copy to
 recautos since you people in this group may have the best advice for
 and experience with troubled teenagers

   if you follow the news for the northwest usa you will have heard that a
 group of twentyyear old boys barely out of the teens certainly their outlook
 was developed during their teens just shot and killed an innocent little
 girl riding in a car in the seattle area when her mother who was driving
 honked her horn at the car with the boys in it  this is really upsetting
 and makes my stomach turn as it would any parents   does not your heart
 just go out to that poor mother


yes fred my heart and prayers go out to the mother and others who have 
been victims of these and other senseless crimes

   you folks in this group have a responsibility to offer any good advice
 that you may have  i suspect lots of people all over the world will read
 and appreciate your comments


however i feel that you have missed the point of the previous postings see 
top  your statement of responsibility is felt as an attack towards the 
members of this group  you are attempting to make the members of this group
be required to answer  the only people who should make a statement are people
who have experienced the problem and found a workable solution

   teenagers both drive cars and are involved in automotive vandalism and
 crime  maybe someone on this newsgroup has had specific experience in
 dealing with violent teenage offenders like these kids are  at the same
 time maybe you would have some good advice for those hostile people who
 sense that are now the potential victims  maybe you would have some good
 advice for them on how not to pay back andor not make the situation worse  
 maybe you have some good advice for local authorities or schools where
 this problem is prevalent  but then again maybe you are not interested 

many people are interested but have no input  i will restate that your last
sentence here is seen as an attack on the members of this group  if people have
input they will give it  if they do not you should not make them feel 
compelled sp to respond  

if you wish to continue this conversation please send email  do not repost or
attempt to bait me i will not make another post and may i make the same a
suggestion to other group members on this matter



   thanks in advance for your help if we get any


by the way your welcome

fcushealth eight myths about national health insurance pt ii

    an office visit that is fiftytwo in seattle is eighteen in vancouver
    canada  that is because among other things they have given their
    government power to bargain with doctors and hospitals over fees

the difference in the litigation environment is reflected in the fees

lack of defensive medicine and nearabsence of malpractice is really
why we spend less using the most expensive approach of pure insurance
in canada along with france and germany without hmos  the nyt
has admitted that malpractice insurance fees are an order of magnitude
lower in canada but doctors takehome pay is almost equal to american
doctors also minimal bureaucracy cos the system is sooo simple
early march

part of the deal for using the allinsurance approach like the french
and germans do hey why do not they criticize france and germany  is
it because too many people take french and german in college to make
the accusations stick  was to preserve the doctors independance
since the provincial wings of the cma are the ones that go to bat when
the fee schedule hikes are presented the politicallybent doctors
were just cackling when they realized the cma would grow in strength
rather than diminish especially when unopposed unlike in socialized
medicine approaches like britains national health service

you have got to remember you have got a waiting list as well but it is  
not as obvious if you are poor and you do not have insurance you do not  
    go to a surgeon in the states you ration by ability to pay  

for nonlife threatening things market arguments adequately cover why
certain procedures are in scarcer demand  i have md friends who cannot
make a living as specialists back in manitoba not due to the insurance
rates but because they will not get enough customers  the cma medical
monopolys grip on doctors licencing as in the us aside  so they
must move to larger places  however this does not refute debunking
of waiting lines for urgent and routine care as has been done in the
yous by consumers reports health policy studies cited by prof dennis
e shea on usenet cnn nyt etc

doug fierro has posted a nyt article from three weeks ago about canadas
health insurance approach on talkpoliticsmedicine  there is one
small error in the article not all of our hospitals are private

would not national health insurance mean that americans who are now  
fully insured might have to settle for less  

in canada provincial insurance covers all health costs except dental  
care eyeglasses prescription drugs ambulance service and private  
hospital rooms  so many canadians do end up buying some private  
insurance a policy to cover all of these things runs about forty to forty  
a month  

of course the one thing to note is that in the canadafrancegermany
case private insurance offloaded the basic coverage to the public
sector  they realized they were keeping lowriskhighprofit extra
insurance for things like privatesemiprivate rooms vs ward
accomodation dental glasses etc for corporate or personal
benefits they will have nothing to do with you if you want to be
covered for basic care

at that point they would not even consider a voucher approach
to broker the universal coverage and sell policies to make up
the difference in the federal guidelines and market stuff

  

would not free care encourage people to run to the doctor for every  
ache and pain  

people who get free treatment do go to the doctor and hospital about  
a third more often than those who have to pay a share of their medical  
bills  

still canadians  who pay nothing at the doctors  have a lower  
perperson health bill than we do

it is free in that there are no deductibles nor copayments two
things which i advocate to make the canadian insurance look more like
real health insurance  which actually it is  i know that when
working in alberta ontario and quebec i was aware that i was paying
for health insurance  eg in toronto ohip fees were listed on my
pay stub manitoba did not collect at paycheque time but only
annually at income tax time built into the tax rate  only fiscal
naifs will proclaim that it is free along with the canadian left for
that is part of their brainwashing agenda

the french do have copayments though  france magazines summer 
one thousand nine hundred and ninetytwo edition has a fantastic presentation of their basic insurance
coverage including a sample chart of copayment percentages  for 
onethirty days you are covered for eighty of the public hospital rate one hundred
afterward  with extra private insurance you can get into a private
hospital and be covered for any differences beyond the public hospital
rate  the public insurance covers one hundred beyond thirty days or the same
cash amount for a private hospital and the difference is paid
outofpocket or according to your supplementary private insurance
over twothreerds of french have some form of extra private insurance  so
the other thirty of health costs in europe are out of private funds not
gleaned from other taxes  the gdp figures are combined public and
private expenditures for total outlay using the same methods that
yield the thirteenfourteen figure for the yous

is not the private health insurance industry just too big  
and powerful to kill  

dismantling the health segment of our insurance industry would be  
politically thorny in the quiet words of one advocate for a  
national plan some onetwo hundred firms now sell more than one hundred and ninetytwo billion in  
health insurance they would put up a hard fight not only has the industry  
grown eightfold since canada shut down its own health insurers but 
our government leaves politicians more open to lobbyists than does  
canadas parliamentary system

health insurance does exist in canada and in western europe its
just that it does not cover basic care  you can opt out in canada
and germany but you will have to go uninsured as a result because
there are too few other people that do so  ie no market

when private insurance realized how much money they would make without the
risks involved in basic insurance eg neurosurgery versus deluxe
amenities eg having to call granada tv to replace a rental set on
the fritz in someone is private hospital room they started to pat
themselves on the back for their social responsibility  in quebec
last spring a consortium of private insurers publicly warned against
any thoughts of privatizing routine low cost parts of that provinces
public health insurance plan

i would like to know if there is any new information out there about the
subject or any new studies being conducted  i am confident in my
pediatrician and her communication with the people in chapel hill but
since this is a lifelong disorder and genetically transferred i would
like keep current  i do realize that since this is a relatively new
disorder first documented in one thousand nine hundred and seventyfour in a fertility clinic in scandanavia
and is therefore controversial

i do not know a lot about this except from seeing one patient with
kartageners syndrome which is a form of immotile cilia syndrome
in which there is situs inversus bronchiectasis and chronic
infections situs inversus means that organs are on the wrong
side of the body and can be complete or partial it is interesting
medically because the normal location of organs is caused in part
by the normal rotation associated with ciliary motion so that in
absence of this laterality can be random people with situs
inversus are quite popular at medical schools because of their
rarity and the fact that most doctors get a bit upset when they
cannot find the patients heart sounds because they are on the wrong
side 

according to harrisons immotile cilia syndrom is an autosomal
recessive which should imply that on average one child in four
in a family would be affected but there may be much more current
information on this and as usual in medicine we may be talking
about more than one conditiion i would suggest that you ask your
pediatrician about contacting a medical geneticics specialist of
which there is probably one at ncsu

what is wrong with the above observation is that it explicitly gives the
impression and you may not in fact hold this view that the common perhaps
even the correct approach for a scientist to follow is to sit around
having flights of fancy and scheming on the basis of his jealousies and
petty hatreds

flights of fancy and other irrational approaches are common  the crucial
thing is not to sit around just having fantasies they are not of any use
unless they make you do some experiments  i have known a lot of scientists
whose fantasies lead them on to creative work usually they will not admit
out loud what the fantasy was prior to the consumption of a few beers

the danger in philosophizing about science is that theory and generalization 
can end up being far removed from the actual daytoday of the grunt at the
bench  yes its great to be involved in a process were i can walk into the
lab after a heavy night of dreaming and just do something for the hell of it
as long as my advisor does not catch me  which is easy enough to do but 
stamping out such behavior seems to be the purpose in life of grant review 
committees and the peer review process in general  in todays world that is 
what determines what science is what gets funded  and a damn good thing to
flights of fantasy just do not have much chance of producing anything at 
least not in biomedical research  the surest way for a graduate student to
ruin their life is to work in a lab where the boss is more concerned with 
fleshing out hisher fantasies than with having the student work on a project
that actually has a good chance of producing some results  mds seem to 
be particularly prone to this aberrant behavior  

simple example warren jelinek noticed an extremely heavy band on a dna
electrophoresis gel of human alu fragments  he got very excited hoping that
he would seen some essential part of the control mechanism for eukaryotic
genes  this fantasy led him to sequence samples of the band and carry out
binding assays  the result was a wellconserved four hundred or so bp sequence
that occurs about five hundredzero times in the human genome  unfortunately for
warrens fantasy it turns out to be a transposon that is present in
so many copies because it replicates itself and copies itself back into
the genome  on the other hand the characteristics of transposons were
much elucidated the necessity of a cellular reverse transcriptase was
recognized and the standard method of recognizing human dna was created
other species have different sets of transposons  fortunately for me
warren and i used to eat dinner at tgi fridays all the time

i have to agree with gary merrills response to this  i have read alot of the
alu and middle repetitive sequence work and it is really very interesting 
good work with implications for many fields in molecular genetics  it is 
really an example of how a well reasoned project turned up interesting 
results that were unexpected

 on february twentyfiveth the new jersey assembly voted to overturn the assault weapon
 ban in that state it looked like it might be a tight vote but the senate
 in nj was going to vote to overturn the ban it would not sit well to have
 an eastern state overturn an assault weapon ban given clintons stated
 agenda on gun control i suspect clinton gave the order to get someone or
 some group with assualt weapons and have the press present they were
 initially
 at the incident in waco to record the event for the tv audience the agent 
 on street stories reported that a supervisor was urging them all to get 
 ready fast as they know we are coming i believe this attack continued 
 even though the probablility of failure was high  because it came from the top 
 down after the nj assembly vote the atf had a limited amount of time to
 come up with something and the wackos in waco fit the bill nicely

for cites on message look up almost anything by john w olney a
toxicologist who has studied the effects of message on the brain and on
development  it is undisputed in the literature that message is an
excitotoxic food additive and that its major constituent glutamate
is essentially the premierie neurotransmitter in the mammalian brain
humans included  too much in the diet and the system gets thrown
off  glutamate and aspartate also an excitotoxin are necessary in
small amounts and are freely available in many foods but the amounts
added by industry are far above the amounts that would normally be
encountered in a ny single food  by eating lots of junk food
packaged soups and diet soft drinks it is possible to jack your
blood levels so high that anyone with a sensitivity to these
compounds will suffer numerous real physininelogical effects 
read olneys review paper in prog brain res one thousand nine hundred and eightyeight and check his
sources they are impecable there is no dispute

                    dianne murray    wcsbeauccscarletonca

in order to excitotoxin effects of message message that in blood must go through 
bloodbrain barrier that i am not sure message can go through or not

elevated levels of glu and asp in the blood are able to bypass the
bloodbrain barrier through the circumventricular organs or cvo in
particular the adeno and neurohypophysis pituitary gland areas  the
arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus and the median eminence regions
are particularly effected  cvo areas are not subject to the
bloodbrain barrier these areas control the release of gonadotropin
which controls the release and flux of steroids governing development
especially sexual development changes in adult rats which are less
sensitive to glu than humans have been observed after ingesting glu
on a chronic basis cycles of several steroids are disrupted blood
levels of somatostatin are significantly reduced and cyclic release
of steroids becomes flattened

                    hope this helps

can someone out there tell me how to switch windows screen resolution
quickly and easily  i know that i can go back into install to do it
but what i would really like is to have is the ability to just change a
couple of startup or configuration files and have the resolution
changed  i already have both video drivers that i need on my system

the subject line says it all  is it terribly difficult to get tickets
to penguins games especially now that they are in the playoffs  would
it be easy to find scalpers outside of the igloo selling tickets

there are always scalpers with tickets outside the arena  you might have
to pay a few bucks extra but you can always find them  look on the
street under the message board or out on the street in front of the hyatt
or even around gate one  the later you buy them the less money you will pay
and during the regular season you could usually find some for near face
value or below if you wait until game time  might be better to pick them
up earlier now though

 the biggest hurdle for automatics imho is not shifting speed
 per se but rather the transmissions reaction speed when you
 try to force it to shift manually  
 

i rented an oldsmobile achieva is that a yuppie name or what and a
nissan stanza  they both had automatics  i am a manual transmission
bigot but i have to admit that the transmissions on these cars were
better shifters than i am  and yes they responded very quickly to
kickdown requests  the nissan had a tachometer so i was able to figure
out which gear i was in  the olds may have also but i do not
remember  i believe it shifted all the way down to second at about fifty
mph when my foot told it no i really want to accelerate quickly

i would still prefer a manual but i will not delude myself into thinking
that i can outaccelerate a modern automatic  and i am very smooth at
shifting but certainly not as good as an automatic

i am not a lawyer so correct me if i am wrong but doing that could be
considered obstruction of justice which could land you in prison for
quite a while

the thing that is great about the secret key is it is idea encrypted so
even if the fbi do get the key they are sol unless they know the magic
word  if they try to force you to give them your pass phrase just say
oops i forgot  since the burden of proof is still on the prosecution
in this country if you keep your mouth shut how can they prove that you
did not forget your pass phrase


well i am no lawyer but i will supply some ancedotal evidence which may
change your mind   note  i do not agree at all with what went on in
this case and neither will most of you  that does not change the fact 
that it did happen  right here in america even

about three or four years ago there was a rather nasty custody case in
or around washington dc  the upshot was an exhusband was suing for 
visitation rights which were granted  the woman believed that the man
had been sexually molesting her children  much like allenfarrow but
not as famous  anyhows she spirits away the kids and refuses to tell the
court where they are and denies him visitation rights

she keeps her mouth shut and what happens  she sits in jail for almost
a year on contempt of court until the legislature passes a special law
limiting the time a person can be held  if they had not passed the law she would
most likely still be there  the kids were in new zealand i belive

now story finished commetary starting  imho the only reason the
legislature moved was because there was an outpouring of public sympathy
for this woman  most people believed she was right and were outraged
not likely to happen for joe random drug dealer child molester or perfectly
innocent privacy lover who might have something
to hide  innocent until proven guilty does not mean you get to walk out
of court humming a happy tune because the fbi cannot read your disk  just
ask those held for contempt those who cannot make bail etc etc

again i disagree totally with the concept of holding someone based
on suspicion but people who keep thinking that it will not happen are bound
to get a rude shock when it does
 

 also not a lawyer etc but if i remember correctly the contempt of court
business is used in order to compel cooperation with what is perhaps
questionably different issue the legitimate business of that court quite
literally the party is found guilty of holding the court in contempt now
the original scheme as suggested here would be to have the key disappear if
certain threatening conditions are met once the key is gone there is no
question of contempt of court as there is nothing to compell the key is no
longer there to be produced

  obstruction of justice would be a different issue but if the suspect in
question would have some legitmate reason to protect his data from prying eyes
however extenuated i think that this charge would be a hard nut to make 

  perhaps it is time for a lawyer to step in and clear this all up

  from graydon 

 if all of these things have been detected in space has anyone
 looked into possible problems with the detectors

 that is is there some mechanism cosmic rays whatever that
 could cause the dector to think it was seeing one of these
 things

 graydon

that would not explain why widely separated detectors such as on ulysses
and pvo and ginga et al would see a burst at the same time  in fact be
fore batse having this widely separated interplanetary network was the
only sure way to locate a random burst  with only one detector one cannot
locate a burst except to say it is somewhere in the field of view  with
two detectors one can use the time that the burst is seen in each detector
to narrow the location to a thin annulus on the sky  with three detectors
one gets intersecting annuli giving two possible locations  if one of these
locations is impossible because say the earth blocked that part of the 
sky voila you have an error box

batse by having eight detectors of its own can do its own location determination
but only to within about three degrees would someone at gsfc like david like
to comment on the current state of location determination  having inde
pendent sightings by other detectors helps drive down the uncertainty

you did touch on something that you did not mean to though  some believe
in a reference that i have somewhere that absorptionlike features seen
in a fraction of grbs can actually be caused by the detector  it would be
a mean nasty god though that would have a nai crystal act like a tentwelve gauss

i was my understanding that the purpose of those removeablefrontpanels
were to make the radio useless and thus discourage theft that is if the 
cover were removed by the owner and taken along whenever the car was left

if those covers were sold for anything remarkably less than the radio 
originally costs or even sold at all
then the above discouragement would not be so great

i personally would be unhappy if i bought a radio like that thinking that 
removing the cover greatly depreciated the radios value and the covers were

brettharpercimlinccom


just a thought on resources  it is very important if you do use a
multiplatform toolkit to check on how it uses resources  i have
used glockenspeil commonview under motif and ostwo  i wrote a resource
converter from ostwo to motif but it really was not too easy especially
the naming scheme in motif you cannot rename controlswidgets
with windows you can call the ok button idok in every instance
this does not work for motif you would have to call it dialogoneok
and motif expects a text string rather than a number  so 
your constructor should know how to convert a define into the
proper resource identifier
i would check on how the toolkit expects names and that if it does
use resources that is uses resources for all platforms you intend to
port to  by the way i would never use commonview or glockenspiel
for anything

the event

 the joliet mud turtles a chicago land four wheel drive club is

 for those who ask what is an onoff road rally well

  an onoff road rally consists of the following

   one an ontheroad rally where participants are given a set of
      directions and clues guiding participates around the 
      jolietplainfield area  the object is to navigate a course
      based on a set of directions and clues  participants will
      be given a set of questions pertaining to the course which
      they must answer along the way  points are awarded for the
      number of correct answers given  directions will ultimately 
      lead to an offroad area where a fourwheel drive course is 
      setup  at various locations in the onroad course checkpoints
      will be setup where participants will be asked other questions
      or requested to perform some activity eg tire roll truck tow
      basketball freethrow etc for additional points

   two an optional offroad four wheel drive course where participants

i live at sealevel and am calledupon to travel to highaltitude cities
quite frequently on business  the cities in question are at seven thousand to nine thousand
feet of altitude  one of them especially is very polluted

often i feel faint the first two or three days  i feel lightheaded and
my heart seems to pound a lot more than at sealevel  also it is very
dry in these cities so i will tend to drink a lot of water and keep
away from dehydrating drinks such as those containing caffeine or alcohol

thing is i still have symptoms  how can i ensure that my short trips there
no i do not usually have a week to acclimatize are as comfortable as possible
is there something else that i could do

a long time ago possibly two years ago there was a discussion here about
altitude adjustment  has anyone saved the messages

    i think you are proposal would work to get an extra one maybe two extra
bits of color resolution  however if you had a display that chould do only
zero or full intensity for each primary i do not think you would get great
equivalent twentyfourbit photographs

i have not suggested to do so i wrote about problems and the problem
were clearly visible with seven bit bw images not to mention twentyfour bit images

 description of experiment deleted 

if the one bit images are viewed quickly and in sync with screen
then one hundred intensities could be better than we have  i do not know

 more deleted 

in any case getting black color with slow machines is problem
i could try it on our eight bit screens but i do not know how to
render pixels with x in constant time i recall our double buffer
has other image color and one bw  that does not help either
maybe i should dump photos to screen with low level code how

a few years ago a friend and i took some two hundred and fiftysix greylevel photos from
a one bit mac plus screen using this method displaying all two hundred and fiftysix levels
synchronized to the sixtyhz display took about ten seconds after
experimenting with different aperture settings and screen
brightnesses we found a range that worked well giving respectable
contrast the quality of the images was pretty good there were no
visible contrast bands

to minimize the exposure time the display program built two hundred and fiftyfive
different one bit frames the first contained a dot only for pixels
that had value two hundred and fiftyfive the second only for pixels that had value two hundred and fiftyfour
etc these frames were stored using a sparse data structure that was
very fast to or onto the screen in sequence creating these
frames sometimes took fiveten minutes on that old mac but the camera
shutter was closed during that time anyway and yes we wrote
directly to the screen memory mea culpa

our biggest problem was that small images were displayed in the
top left corner of the screen instead of the center it took
an extra week to have the film developed and printed because the
processors took the trouble to manually move the all images into
the center of the print who would have guessed

in reference to the limits of acceleration with guns launching solid
rockets as payloads  thiokol provided me with samples and data on
a reinforcement to solid motor grains for high accelerations  solid
motor propellants usually have a substantial percentage of 
aluminum in the mix  for example the space shuttle srbs are sixteen percent
aluminum  the technique is to use a foamed aluminum structure
the structure looks like the inverse of a set of bubbles an i suspect
some bubbling process is used to form it  in other words if you made
a bunch of bubbles in molten aluminum then froze it this is what
you get  it forms a strong network of effectively aluminum wires in
all directions  the remaining solid fuel mix is infiltrated into
the voids and you get aluminumreinforced solid propellant  the
foamedaluminum makes up about six percent of the total propellant
so there is still aluminum particles in the bulk grain  the major
improvement is the higher resistance to grain cracking which is the
principal failure mode for solid propellant

bradley center in milwaukee is home to the milwaukee admirals minor leauge
hockey team  the owner of the admirals sorry i cannot remember his name
either owns or at least shelled out the majority of the funds to build the
bradley center

lloyd pettit married into allenbradley corp abcom family and owns the
admirals  he donated the bradley center and the new pettit national ice
center

supposedly he was approached by the nhl about an expansion franchise but 
turned it down because he thought the franchise fee of fifty million was too
high

this is not the way i have heard it  see lloyd as he is affectionately
referred to by milwaukeeans and bob uecker bought the bradley center to get
the nhl to come here

like i said i do not know whether this story is true or just a rumor but if
it is true do not look for an nhl team in milwaukee anytime soon  the admirals
are not going to be forced out of the building and you will not see an nhl club
and a minor league club in the same building especially since the nbas

  if we are interested of real allround players the power play stats
  should be considered too because the power play is also one aspect

i am going to any good player should score on power plays because of the man
advantage  very good power play scorers tend to become overrated
because their point totals are inflated by power play points
 tends to expose these overrated players such as brett hull

given the opportunity to play power play consistently any player can

i am not saying that conflicts started with that it is only
not one side being the aggressive and the ither always suffering
it is sad that we both still are not trying to compromise
i remember the action of the turkish government by removing the
visa requirement for greeks to come to turkey i thought it
was a positive attempt to make the relations better

 i thought it was a smart move to receive more money from greek tourists
 i bet that this week there should be about two hundredzero tourists from greece
 in turkey  each one will leave at least onezero so go and figure what this
 means to your economy  if you had kept the visa requirement how many
 greeks would bother to visit turkey

smart indeed  if what you are saying is true greeks who visit are happy
the turkish merchants are happy who is harmed  no one  so not only was
it a smart move it was also a good move for it adds to the happiness of
two hundredzero greeks per week and however many turkish merchants they interact with
one simple move in the paperwork arena  lotsa happy people of both 
nationalities  just and observation

this is the dr beter audio letterr one thousand six hundred and twentynine k st nw washington
dc  twenty thousand and six

   hello my friends this is dr beter  today is april thirty
one thousand nine hundred and eightytwo and this is my audio letterr no seventyfour

  it is now been almost one month since war broke out in the south
atlantic  on the surface it seems that it is only a dispute
between argentina and great britain over the barren windswept
falkland islands and south georgia island  in reality it is far
more than that

   the socalled falklands crisis is just the visible tip of a
giant military operation  during this month of april one thousand nine hundred and eightytwo
fierce naval battles have taken placenot only in the south
atlantic but also in the south pacific  up to now most of the
hostilities have been kept under wraps by wartime censorship on
all sides  but as i say these words the naval war in the
southern hemisphere is about to come to the surface

   beginning today april thirty a total naval and air blockade of
the falklands by the royal navy has begun  at the same time a
counterblockade has been declared by argentina in the same area

   to be effective a blockade must be imposed over a period of
time but the royal navy does not have that much time  winter is
coming on in the south atlantic and the british supply lines are
overextended  having come this far her majestys navy cannot
simply drop the blockade and sail away in a few weeks time
without drawing blood from argentina  as a result the british
will be forced to undertake military operations very soon no
matter how risky they may be

   there is also another reason why the royal navy now has no
choice but to engage the argentine forces in combat  that
reason my friends is that the royal navy has already suffered
losses in secret combat this month  up to this moment there will
be no way to explain away the damage which has been sustained by
the british fleet  only when publicly admitted fighting erupts
will the british dare to admit that they have suffered battle
losses  to obtain that cover story the british have no choice
but to sail into combat but in doing so they will be risking
even heavier losses on top of those already sustained  in short
my friends her majestys navy has sailed into a trap

   the events now unfolding in the south atlantic carry strange
ironic echoes of the past  for weeks now we have been hearing
countless commentators referring to the british task force as an
armada quote  the british of all people ought to be very
uneasy with that description  the original spanish armada four hundred
years ago was renowned as a seemingly invincible fighting force
but it came to grief in a naval disaster so complete that it
changed the course of historyand it was none other than the
english navy that destroyed the spanish armada

   the original spanish armada put to sea in one thousand five hundred and eightyeight during the
reign of englands queen elizabeth i  the armada was an invasion
fleet carrying thousands of crack fighting men to invade england 
they were met by the daring sea dogs of sir francis drake  drake
and his small fast ships turned the tables on the spanish armada
by changing the rules of battle  the english fleet was equipped
with new longerrange guns and it stayed upwind and out of
reach  from there the english pounded smashed and shattered
the big ships of the mighty armada  when it was all over barely
half the spanish fleet was left to limp back to port  drakes
defeat of the spanish armada was a shock to the world  it opened
the door for england under queen elizabeth i to start its
expansion into a truly global empire

   today four hundred years later history seems to have come full
circle  queen elizabeth ii is witnessing the dismantling of the
world empire whose heyday began under queen elizabeth i and now
the cultures of england and of spain are once again in
confrontation  once again a socalled armada is preparing for
invasion but this time the armada is british not spanish  four
hundred years ago sir francis drake was the hero of the day
today the ghost of francis drake is once again on the scene

   the south atlantic war zone is at the eastern end of the drake
passage around the southern tip of south america  the defeat of
the spanish armada four centuries ago broke the back of spains
naval supremacy and now the defeat of the new british armada may
well break the back of what remains of the once glorious royal
navy

   my three special topics for this audio letter are

topic onethe military secret of south georgia island
topic twothe secret naval war of the southern hemisphere
topic threethe rockefeller fear campaign against nuclear war

topic onewhen the falkland islands crisis began early this month
it looked at first like a tempest in a teapot  for a century and
a half since one thousand eight hundred and thirtythree the islands have been controlled by great
britain  during that entire time british sovereignty over the
falklands has been disputed by argentina  there have been
countless threats by argentina to seize the islands which it
calls the malvinas but the threats have always come to nothing
in the past and britain has never even gotten very worried about
them

   the islands are four times as distant from argentina as cuba
is from the united states and they are not much of a prize 
after one hundred and fifty years of occupancy the falklands are home to fewer
than twozero british settlers and a lot of sheep  in short the
remote falkland islands hardly look like something to fight over
and yet here we are watching another crisis take place  we are
watching as war erupts between great britain and argentina

   the thatcher government is acting as if it has forgotten all
about its usual preoccupation with the soviet threat at natos
doorstep  instead britain is throwing almost everything it is
got at argentinaaircraft carriers cruisers destroyers
submarines assault shipsyou name it  luxury cruise ships have
even been commissioned and turned into troop carriers overnight 
wave after wave of additional assault troops have been activated
and sent to join the fleet even after it sailed  ships and
submarines have been pulled off station from normal nato duty and
sent to reinforce the task force  the initial fortyship force has
grown steadily over the past several weeks into an armada
numbering over seventy  over twothirds of the entire royal navy has
already been deployed to the south atlantic off argentina

   watching all this a lot of people are asking what is this
fight really all about  the most popular answer suggested in the
major media is oil  vast deposits of oil are known to exist
under the continental shelf between argentina and the falklands
but that has been known for nearly ten years  in no way does it
explain the timing of the sudden military offensive by argentina
this month and oil explains even less about the argentine
seizure of south georgia island

   south georgia island is eight hundred miles east of the falklands with
no known oil deposits anywhere near it and compared to south
georgia the falklands are an island paradise  south georgia
island is covered with rugged mountains treacherous valleys
glaciers and semipermanent snow  most of it is uninhabitable 
on top of all that argentina has absolutely no legal or
historical claim to south georgia island  in that respect it
stands in sharp contrast to the falklands

   in the early one thousand eight hundred and thirtys the falklands were occupied for a while by
argentine colonists  in one thousand eight hundred and thirtythree the british expelled them and took
over the island  for that and other historical reasons
argentina argues that the falklands really belong to argentina
not britain

   but no such argument is possible for south georgia island  it
has always been controlled by britain never by argentina or
spain  the argentine seizure of south georgia island looks even
more unreasonable from a military point of view  argentinas
leaders are military men and they think in military terms  they
were well aware ahead of time that faroff south georgia island
could not possibly be held for long  by seizing it they were
setting themselves up to absorb a military defeat as the island
was retaken by britain  so the question is why did argentinas
military junta bother with the seemingly worthless south georgia
island at all

   my friends the answers to all these questions are military
not political or economic  south georgia island possesses an
enormous military secret  it is a giant underground installation
buried under the mountains at the northwest end of the island 
the real reason for the socalled falkland crisis is this secret
installation together with two other similar installations which
i will describe shortly

   the secret military complexes have been in existence for many
years they are not new  what is new is the accelerated nuclear
war timetable of the american bolshevik war planners here in
washington  for the past two months i have been reporting the
details of this new war plan to you as quickly as i can obtain
and verify them

   the plan calls for nuclear war one to erupt by september of
this year one thousand nine hundred and eightytwo  it is this fastapproaching nuclear war threat
that caused the socalled falklands crisis to erupt now

   what is going on now is a coordinated effort to spoil part of
the bolshevik grand strategy for the coming nuclear war  the
mutual enemies of the american bolsheviks herenamely the
rockefeller carteland russias new rulers in the kremlin are
behind the present crisis  they are trying to ruin phase three of
the project z war plan which i revealed last month  that phase
is to be world domination by the american bolsheviks after both
russia and the united states have been destroyed in nuclear war
one  as i mentioned last month the key to this plan is the
existence of secret weapons stockpiles in various places around
the world

   the american bolshevik military planners here in america are
working with other bolshevik agents in key military positions of
other countries to set off war  having done that they intend to
ride out the nuclear holocaust they have caused safe and cozy in
government war bunkers  when the warring nations finally lie
smoldering and exhausted the bolsheviks will leave the shattered
remains of their host countries  they will rendezvous at the
secret weapons installations and bring their weapons into the
open  they will confront the world with the only remaining
fresh uptodate powerful military force on earth and using
that military power they will become the undisputed rulers of
the worldthat is they plan to do all this and they plan to
pave the way for world domination very soon by setting off
nuclear war one in a matter of months  the rockefeller cartel
and russias new antibolshevik rulers are working together in a
race against time to try to head off the bolshevik war plan

   last month i mentioned that the bolsheviks here are
benefitting from war preparations which were started by the
rockefellers long ago  it has only been about three years since
the rockefellers were dislodged as the prime movers of the united
states government by the bolsheviks  since that time the united
states government has been a house divided torn by internal
power struggles between rival bolshevik and rockefeller factions 
but before that the united states had been dominated for decades
both economically and politically by the four rockefeller
brothers

   in one thousand nine hundred and sixtyone the brothers launched a new longrange plan for world
domination  it was a twoprong strategy half visible and half
secret which i first described long ago in audio letter no twentyeight 
it was a plan for the united states to arm to the teeth in secret
while appearing to disarm gradually  without repeating all the
details the basic idea was grandiose yet simple  by
deliberately appearing weak the rockefellercontrolled united
states would maneuver itself into a nuclear war with russia 
then the secret weapons including superweapons would be
unleashed to smash russia and take over the world

   when they set the grand plan in motion in one thousand nine hundred and sixtyone the
rockefeller brothers were looking ahead to a nuclear war by the
late one thousand nine hundred and seventys  their military analysts concluded very early that
the war being planned would have very different effects on the
northern and southern hemispheres  both superpowers the united
states and the soviet union are located well up in the northern
hemisphere so are the other fullfledged nuclear powersgreat
britain france red china and india  by contrast the
strategic targets for nuclear war in the southern hemisphere are
relatively few and far between  in other words it was expected
that the coming nuclear war would be essentially a northern
hemisphere war

   in an allout nuclear holocaust it is known that serious
radioactive fallout will gradually spread to affect even areas
not initially hit by war  but there are limits to how far the
war clouds can spread  it was discovered long ago that there is
very little mixing between the air of the northern and southern
hemispheres  in the northern half of our planet cold air from
the north pole works its way southward towards the equator then
it works its way back to the north as warm air  a mirror image
of this process takes up the southern half of the planet 
northern and southern hemisphere air meet in the equatorial zone
but very little of the air changes places

   the military conclusion my friends is this the coming
nuclear war could ruin large areas of the northern hemisphere for
generations to come but if the calculations are right the
southern hemisphere could escape virtually unaffected by the war 
this was music to the ears of the four rockefeller brothers  a
quick look at the globe of the world shows why  the rockefeller
cartel has dominated latin america ever since world war ii  as i
discussed in my very first monthly audio letter nelson
rockefeller solidified the cartel grip on latin america during
the war  he accomplished this as socalled coordinator of
hemispheric defense for thenpresident franklin d roosevelt 
so that takes care of the south american continent and its
natural resources

   then there is the african continent  there too rockefeller
control was already in effect over wide areas of black africa
especially south of the equator  all this was thanks to the
efforts of john d rockefeller iii as i detailed in audio letter
no thirtysix

   looking around the globe the most important remaining land
masses from the standpoint of world domination are australia and
new zealand  thanks to world war ii both were wide open to the
rockefellers

   the rockefeller brothers decided to establish secret military
installations in the southern hemisphere for use after the coming
war  by this means they expected to become the masters of the
surviving southern half of planet earth after the northern
hemisphere war  then as the northern hemisphere gradually
recovered from the nuclear holocaust the rockefeller empire
would be able to pick up the pieces  in this way the third
generation rockefeller brothers expected their family dynasty to
inherit the earth

   in order to control the southern hemisphere militarily after
the war some means would have to be available to project
military power onto any land mass  for example revolts against
rockefeller domination would require troopsnot a blast from the
beam weapons on the moon  the most critical factor for postwar
military domination of the world was found to be a navy  a
minimum of two secret naval fleets would be requiredone based
in the south atlantic the other in the south pacific  since the
reserve naval fleets were to be kept secret until after the
northern hemisphere nuclear war they could not be built in
existing shipyards  new construction facilities had to be built
and they had to be hidden  to hide an entire shipyard is no
small task they take up a lot of space  on top of that it was
essential that the ships remain hidden after they were built 
the best way to achieve that was to combine the shipyard and
naval base into one overall secret installation  finally the
secret naval installation had to be invulnerable to nuclear
attack otherwise if its existence were ever discovered
prematurely the secret navy might be wiped out

   the combined requirements for secrecy space and protection
against attack were formidable but one day in one thousand nine hundred and fiftynine while all
these plans were still in the early stages of development the
answer presented itself  during a socalled banking trip to
sweden david rockefeller was given a tour of a unique hidden
naval port  the port is hollowed out from solid granite cliffs
which come right down to the water  the entrance to the port is
a gigantic hole in the side of the cliff which can be sealed off
with enormous steel doors  inside this big doorway on the water
a huge cavity has been hollowed out to accommodate ships

   the rockefeller brothers and their military adviser decided
that a bigger more secret better protected version of the
swedish hidden port was just what they wanted  a survey of
candidate sites was then initiated  the site survey covered
coastal areas throughout the southern hemisphere  many areas
were rejected very quickly because the topography was wrong 
other areas were rejected because they were too close to the
equator  still others had to be ruled out because there were too
many people living nearby making the desired level of secrecy
impossible  finally it was essential that the sites chosen for
the secret naval installations be totally secure politically

   at last the sites for the secret naval installations were
selected  in the south pacific extreme southern new zealand was
selected  this is what i was alluding to in audio letter no seventyone
three months ago when i called attention to new zealands extreme
importance in the coming war

   in order to obtain the necessary space the secret new zealand
naval installation had to be divided up into two sites located
close together  one is at the extreme southwest tip of south
island where the mountain range known as the southern alps comes
down virtually to the waters edge  the other part of the
installation is built into the northwest tip of stewart island
which is off the tip of south island  the stewart island
facility is hollowed out within a rise known as mt anglem

   the new zealand location met all the requirements  ever since
world war ii the government of new zealand has been tied even
closer to the united states than to great britain  the location
is far from the equator and the installations are buried deep
under mountains protected from nuclear attack  they are also
too deep to be reached by particlebeam attacks and the new
zealand site is well situated to command the entire south
pacific

   in the south atlantic an even more perfect site was found 
that site my friends is south georgia island  it is located
perfectly for naval domination of the entire south atlantic  the
tall rugged mountains provided a perfect location for the secret
installation at the northwest tip of the one hundredmile long island 
it is controlled by great britain whose government like that of
new zealand was willing to cooperate and south georgia island
was virtually uninhabited except for a whaling station on the
northeast coast  the whaling station was some fifty miles away from
the secret new installation which was being built but britain
took no chances  in one thousand nine hundred and sixtyfive the whaling station was closed down 
since that time there have been no inhabitants on south georgia
island except for a few dozen alleged antarctic scientists

   construction of the secret naval facilitiestwo in new
zealand one on south georgia islandbegan in the early one thousand nine hundred and sixtys 
the techniques were adapted from those used previously to build
other large underground facilities such as the norad
installation inside cheyenne mountain colorado however these
techniques were adapted in radically new ways to achieve
construction access directly from the sea instead of overland 
in this way the sheltering mountain was left undisturbed in
appearance both during and after construction

   the cuts in the mountain side which were necessary to let
ships in and out were kept as small as possible and were well
camouflaged  like the swedish hidden naval port arrangement the
entrances to the secret installations can be sealed up  when
sealed the entrance is virtually impossible to detect unless you
know exactly where it is and unlike most large construction
projects there are no tailings or piles of leftover rock lying
around to attract attention  the manmade caverns which house
the secret naval installations are enormous but all the rock and
debris was disposed of at sea

   once the secret naval facilities were built they had to be
outfitted for ship construction and docksite storage  the fake
disarmament of the united states during the one thousand nine hundred and sixtys contributed
greatly to this task  from one thousand nine hundred and sixtyone to one thousand nine hundred and sixtyeight one man played a pivotal
role in this elaborate rockefeller scheme  he was thensecretary
of defense robert mcnamara  all through the sixtys mcnamara
presided over the public paring back of americas visible
military power  this included the closing down and dismantling
of entire shipyards  what we were not told was where all that
shipyard equipment went afterwards  where it went my friends
was to the new secret installations which were being outfitted in
new zealand and south georgia island

   the secret naval installations have been used as duplication
facilities to reproduce certain ships and submarines designed and
built here in the united states  as defense secretary caspar
weinberger told congress recently it is cheaper to build two
ships at a time  that is especially true if the second ship is
an exact duplicate of the first  this has become even more true
in recent years through the use of computerized manufacturing
techniques

   the secret naval fleets which have been built at the secret
installations are made up of duplicatesexact duplicates of
certain other ships and submarines  they are all nuclear
powerednuclear subs nuclear cruisers nuclear destroyers
and yes nuclear aircraft carriers three of them  a secret twin
was built for the youss nimitz for the youss eisenhower and
for the newlylaunched youss carl vincent  all have been
financed through the gigantic cost overruns so called that we
constantly hear about in the defense department and all three
carriers have been provided with a full complement of aircraft
whose manufacture was financed the same way

   the ships of the secret american bolshevik naval fleets are
all duplicates of other nuclearpowered vessels  even so the
secret naval ships possess one key difference

   last month i revealed that the socalled stealth program has
succeeded in developing a kind of electromagnetic invisibility
shield  this technique makes an object invisible from a distance
by distorting light waves in its vicinity

   a whole new fleet of phantom warplanes are now going into
crash production that use this principle and my friends all of
the secret american bolshevik navy ships have already been
outfitted with similar stealthfield equipment  the stealth
principle is actually easier to apply to ships than to airplanes
because there is more room for the powerful equipment that
generates the field

   after nuclear war one the secret stealth navy of the american
bolsheviks would be light years ahead of any other navy left on
earth  it would be perfect for the intended role of world
domination  the rockefellers set it all in motion long ago my
friends but three years ago they lost control of the united
states military  now it is the american bolsheviks who are in
control and they are bent on war

   these secret naval installations have precipitated what is
being called the falklands crisis

topic twoin audio letterr no seventythree last month i described
project z the new bolshevik threephase strategy for nuclear
war one

   an elite group of american bolshevik military planners here
are flushing out the plan right now at a secret warroom here in
washington  it is a plan by which the united states will strike
the first nuclear blow followed by allout thermonuclear war
with russia

   having set off the holocaust the bolsheviks here and in
certain other countries plan to rise it out safe in comfortable
war bunkers  finally after nuclear war one fizzles out in
stalemate they plan to leave behind the ashes of the united
states and her allies  activating phase three of their grand
strategy they plan to unveil their secret weapons especially
their secret naval fleets  with these they plan to conquer and
rule what is left of the world  the united states as we know it
will be dead and gone but in the eyes of the bolsheviks
themselves this outcome will constitute victory

   up to now the nuclear war timetable which i first revealed two
months ago is still on track  they are still shooting for
nuclear war to begin by september of this year one thousand nine hundred and eightytwo  time is
fast running out

   the bolsheviks here are sprinting as fast as they can toward
war but my friends the bolsheviks are not the only runners in
this race  they have two deadly enemies both of whom are
equally determined to trip up the bolsheviks  one enemy of the
bolsheviks here is the rockefeller cartel the other enemy is the
new antibolshevik ruling clique in russia and now these two
mutual enemies of the bolsheviks are pooling their efforts in
certain ways

   in audio letter no seventyone three months ago i reported that a
limited new antibolshevik coalition was in the works between
the rockefeller cartel and the russians  the january twentysix meeting
between haig and gromyko in geneva switzerland was a turning
point in the formation of this coalition  it is now a reality
and is responsible for the socalled falkland crisis now
dominating the headlines  it should be emphasized that this new
relationship between the rockefeller cartel and russia falls far
short of a true alliance  they have very major disputes to be
settled between them but for the time being they have called a
truce between themselves to deal with their mutual deadly
enemythe bolsheviks here in america

   the first priority of the russians and the rockefellers is to
slow down the bolshevik preparations for imminent nuclear war 
if they can do that time is on the side of the rockefeller
cartel in certain political movements which i discussed last
summer in audio letter no sixtyseven  a slowdown in the nuclear war
timetable will also give more breathing space for additional
antibolshevik actions to be implemented

   the joint rockefellerrussian planners decided by midfebruary
that military action against the bolsheviks was essential very
quickly  no other type of action had any hope of taking effect
fast enough to prevent nuclear war by the end of this summer

   the exact details of the project z war plan are not known to
either the rockefellers or the russians but the general outlines
are known to be as i described last month

   it was decided that military action should be devised that
would undermine phase three of the bolshevik war planthat is the
bolshevikcontrolled secret naval installations and fleets in the
southern hemisphere should be attacked and crippled  by working
together the rockefeller cartel and the russians were able to
devise an attack plan which neither could have carried out alone 
the rockefeller group who built and originally controlled these
bases provided detailed intelligence about the best way to
attack them  the russians with their enormous military machine
provided the muscle to actually carry out the attack

   it was essential to devise a scheme that would enable both
secret fleets in the south atlantic and south pacific to be
attacked  survival intact of either fleet would leave the
bolshevik war plan still workable

   military analysts concluded very quickly that a direct assault
on the new zealand facilities was out of the question  there was
no combination of commandos frogmen or other military force
which could possibly keep an attack secret from the outside
world  any attack on the new zealand bases would set off the
very war which the rockefellers and russians want to prevent

   but the situation in the south atlantic was a different
matter  in a way the greatest asset of south georgia island was
also its achilles heel  the extreme isolation which protected
the secrecy of the south georgia base also made a covert military
assault feasible  the key lay with argentina and her
longstanding claims to the falkland islands

   as i mentioned in topic one the rockefeller cartel has
dominated all of latin america for decades  cartel operatives
were sent to argentina to work out a deal with the government
military junta there  the historic dispute over the falkland
islands was to be used to provide a ruse a military cover to
enable the south georgia base to be attacked  the argentine
generals were not told everything about the situation by any
means but they were told enough to make clear what they were to
do

   as an inducement to cooperate the argentine leaders were
promised handsome rewards  they were guaranteed that after the
shooting was over the falkland islands would remain in argentine
hands  this guarantee included the promise of covert military
assistance as needed against the royal navy  and to bolster the
troubled argentine economy it was promised that the rockefeller
cartel will help develop the immense offshore oil reserves  with
these combined promises of military glory and financial rewards
the argentine military junta agreed to the plan

   on march nineteen argentina carried out act one in the joint attack
plan  a group of argentine scrapmetal merchants of all things
landed at the abandoned old whaling station on south georgia
island  supposedly they were there to dismantle the old
buildings and cart them off to sell  while they were at it they
also raised the argentine flag over the worksite  the british
always nervous about south georgia island promptly reacted as
expected  the british antarctic survey ship endurance put twentytwo
marines ashore  they drove off the scrap merchants and tore down
the argentine flag

   the incident provided the desired excuse for the argentine
junta to bring the simmering one hundred and fiftyyearold falklands dispute to a
boil  from time to time in the past argentina has claimed that
south georgia is part of the falklands because it is administered
that way by britain  that argument is very flimsy but it now
came in very handy  it was nothing new to hear this from
argentine leaders so there was no hint of what was really afoot

   during late march argentine military forces started
assembling for an assault on the falklands  nothing new
thought the british high command  argentina has carried out
threatening maneuvers in the past many times  it was believed
that they were about to do it again but on april two argentine
forces did the unexpected  after many past false alarms this
time they actually invaded and seized the islands  all argentine
public statements emphasized the longstanding historical claims
to the falklands themselves but just for good measure the next
day a small argentine force also seized faroff south georgia
island  the force was so small that it gave the appearance
initially that it was just a side show from argentinas point of
view however the small contingent of twentytwo royal marines were
overpowered and bundled off the island along with a group of thirteen
alleged scientists  that was the moment of payoff in the joint
rockefellerrussian attack plan

   thanks to the elaborate distraction staged by the argentine
forces a special commando team got onto the island undetected 
based on the detailed rockefeller information about the base the
team moved to a location on the mountain directly above the
cavernous secret base  special highspeed drilling equipment was
set up by the rockefeller members of the team while the russian
members concentrated on military defense  by late that evening
april three the military high command in london finally learned what
was really taking place  the secret south georgia base was under
attack by virtually the only means possible  the joint
rockefellerrussian team were drilling a shaft down through the
mountain toward the hollowed out cavern inside  it was only a
matter of time until their drill would break through the ceiling
of the giant hidden naval base  once the hole was made the next
step was obvious  the rockefellerrussian team would put a
weapon of some kind through the hole  the best guess was that it
would be a nerve gas

   the shock waves that went through the highest levels of the
british government on the evening of april three can hardly be
described my friends  the thatcher government like the
socalled reagan administration here in america is bolshevik
controlled  that is why margaret thatcher always says me too
any time the reagan administration says or does anything against
russia  both governments are party to the secret nuclear war
plan in complete betrayal of the people of their respective
countries and on the evening of april three they suddenly discovered
that their precious war plan was in deep deep trouble

   immediately the thatcher government started assembling a naval
armada to sail for the south atlantic  haste was the order of
the day  the drilling on south georgia island was proceeding
around the clock  the best estimates were that the drilling
would break through into the roof of the naval base in about
three weeks on or about april twentyfour  if help did not reach south
georgia by then the secret installation might be doomed  the
forces stationed at the installation itself were unable to defend
themselves under the circumstances  their mighty naval ships
were ships in a bottle  they did not dare open the bottle to
sail out to fight because the russian commandos were armed with
tactical and nuclear weapons  to open the blastproof entrance
doors would be suicide

   on april five just two days after south georgia island was
seized some forty naval ships began moving out of british ports 
the same day lord carrington was sacked as foreign minister  he
was forced to resign my friends because he had assisted the
rockefeller attack plan by downplaying the argentine attack
preparations

   that same day april five new zealand the home of the other
secret naval fleet broke diplomatic relations with argentina 
the two hidden new zealand facilities had been placed on red
alert  as a precautionary measure all submarines at the twin
base were ordered to sea  several surface ships were already at
sea undergoing sea trials but that still left seven seven major
ships inside the hidden twin naval base including one of the
nuclear aircraft carriers i mentioned earlier

   on that busy day of april five argentinas foreign minister
costa mendez was at the united nations in new york  he was
alarmed by the deployment of such a large part of the royal navy 
costa mendez hurried here to washington to seek reassurances from
certain officials  he got them

   for the next two weeks or so the news was filled with stories
about the allegedly slow movement of the british fleet while
negotiations went on  that my friends was only a cover story 
the royal navy was actually joining up and moving as rapidly as
possible toward south georgia island  if the task force arrived
in time to save the secret base a major battle was likely  the
official stories about slow movement of the british armada were
intended to give a cushion of time for that battle  if need be
the fleet would have several days to retake south georgia island
then it could move on to arrive near the falklands on the
announced schedule  in this way the crucial importance of south
georgia island would be hidden and the big secret preserved

   it was initially expected that advance elements of the british
fleet would reach the vicinity of south georgia island within two
weeks  that would have been soon enough to attack the joint
rockefellerrussian commando team and stop the drilling before it
was completed  but russian cosmospheres and submarines made a
shambles of the plan

   key advance elements of the south georgia attack contingent
left ascension island early april fourteen two days before it was
announced officially  shortly after they did so they ran into
trouble  russian cosmospheres and attack submarines closed in on
a single ship which was critical to the planned counterassault on
south georgia island  the cosmospheres bombarded the bridge and
combat information center of the ship with neutron radiation  in
moments the ship was without any command its communications and
radar silenced  then a russian sub closed in and quickly
finished off this key british ship with torpedoes  it broke
apart with secondary explosions and sank rapidly  so far as is
known there were no survivors

   this unexpected shock in the midatlantic produced two
results both important

first it caused a slowdown in the race toward the south atlantic
by the british armada  the task force had to be regrouped into a
configuration better suited for an enroute defense but that cost
valuable time  public announcements from london about the
progress of the fleet reflected this slowdown  the timetable for
arrival on battle stations near the falklands started stretching
out longer and longer  all this bought extra time for the joint
commando team on south georgia island  the drilling continued

the other result of the sinking was equally important  word was
flashed to the south pacific stealth navy to prepare for possible
action  it was obvious that the russian navy was getting
involved in the atlantic which meant that the royal navy could
be in big trouble  during the dead of night early april fifteen the
seven stealth ships put to sea from their twin secret bases in
southern new zealand  they deployed to a secret operational
headquarters area in the antipodes islands four hundred and fifty miles southeast
of new zealand  their electromagnetic shields were operating to
provide protection from attack  these shields make it impossible
to communicate with the outside world or even to see it as i
explained last month but once they arrived at the antipodes the
stealth ships hooked up to buoys equipped with shielded
communication cables to the island headquarters  the antipodes
headquarters in turn was in constant touch with the south
georgia base by way of a transoceanic cable around the tip of
south america  the deployment of the available ships of the
south pacific stealth fleet was exactly what the joint
rockefellerrussian planners had hoped for  the ships had been
flushed out from their essentially invulnerable hiding place in
new zealand

   the british ships sinking of april fourteen was also followed by
other events  on april fifteen the argentine navy started moving out
of port  the same day alexander haig arrived again in buenos
aires  supposedly he was there as a diplomat but in reality he
was there as a general dealing with generals  haig is the top
governmental operative of the rockefeller cartel as i have
revealed in the past  he was making sure that the argentines did
not get cold feet and back down at that critical moment  four
days later april nineteen haig left for washington  as he boarded
his plane haig somberly told reporters time is running out 
and so it was my friends for the secret south georgia base

   the very next day april twenty the drill broke through into the
hollowedout cavern of the naval base  bolshevik military
analysts in london had not expected that it could be completed
until at least the following weekend  the british fleet was
still out of range

   the weapon which the commando team inserted down through the
long hole was a small compact russian neutron bomb  when it was
detonated inside the confines of the huge artificial cave the
effects were devastating  the intense radiation instantly killed
everyone inside the base  also the heat and blast effects of the
bomb are believed to have damaged all the ships inside
sufficiently to badly disable them

   meanwhile russian cosmospheres and submarines were converging
on the stealth ships which were near the antipodes islands
awaiting orders  from a distance the ships were invisible to
the eye due to their protective shields which also protect
against beamweapon attack but they were sitting ducks for the
tactics which the russians employed

   floating overhead the cosmospheres located the seven ships
using their psychoenergetic rangefinding equipment known as prf 
as i have reported in the past there is no method known by which
prf can be jammed  the cosmospheres radioed the exact locations
of the ships to the attack submarines  the subs were armed
with special nonhoming nonnuclear torpedoes designed to
explode on impact  more sophisticated torpedoes would have been
thrown off course or detonated prematurely by the protective
shield of each ship but these simple torpedoes just cruise right
through each invisibility field to strike the ship and explode 
within fifteen minutes after the attack began all seven bolshevik
stealth ships were on their way to the bottom and with them went
their bolshevik commanders and mercenary crews collected from
around the world

   the south pacific action took place just after sunset local
time  the time here in washington was around twozero pm april twentythree 
that evening secretary of state haig was seen briefly in public
with the new british foreign minister francis pym  pym was
wearing the artificial pseudosmile which diplomats are taught
always to display in public  but not haig  haig was grinning
from ear to ear and no wonder  the joint rockefellerrussian
military operation had been a brilliant success  the secret
bolshevik south atlantic fleet had been virtually wiped out
bottled up inside south georgia island and the south pacific
fleet while not totally wiped out had been badly crippled  by
working together the rockefeller cartel and the russians had won
the secret naval war of the southern hemisphere

topic threeas i say these words news reports give the impression
that war is about to erupt in the south atlantic but the real
war in the southern hemisphere is already over  what we are
watching now is the beginning of its bloody aftermath  that
aftermath is the battle for the falkland islands  they have been
promised to argentina as a reward for her role in the secret war

   at this moment the bolsheviks here in washington are pressing
for a public announcement that the united states will side with
britain  as soon as that takes place military action will heat
up fast around the falklands  britain has no choice but to
fight  she has already suffered casualties which cannot be
explained without a public battle but by fighting the
bolsheviks in britain are running the risk of a humiliating and
tragic defeat for the royal navy

   meanwhile the rockefeller strategists here are now
concentrating on a fastbuilding antinuclearwar campaign  on
all sides now we are hearing about the socalled nuclear freeze
movement  there are documentaries articles publicity of all
kinds to sensitize us to the terrors of nuclear war  in recent
months there have even been referenda popping up on election
ballots dealing with the nuclear war issue  medical doctors are
banding together to warn the public about what would happen if
there were a nuclear war

   we are being told that all this is just popping up
spontaneously  we are now thirtyseven years into the nuclear age and
nothing like this has ever gained so much momentum before yet
now we are supposed to believe that millions of americans have
spontaneously gotten the same ideas at the same time  if you
believe that my friends i give up  movements like this never
and i mean never develop without leadership organization and
moneyand plenty of it

   what we are watching is the rockefeller public relations
machine at work  as i have explained in the past the rockefeller
cartel cannot afford to let a nuclear war take place  if it
does they will lose everything because they are not in a
position to control it  instead the deadly enemies of the
rockefeller cartel the bolsheviks here will win out if there is
a war and so the rockefeller faction is now doing everything in
its power to prevent a nuclear war

   the present antinuclearwar orientation of the rockefeller
cartel creates certain temporary common interests between them
and russia but as russias new rulers know very well this does
not spring from any great moral perspective on the part of the
rockefeller group  it is purely a matter of practical necessity
right now for the rockefellers

   the russians regard the united states as a house divided and
they are exploiting that division by working in careful ways with
the rockefellers  their first priority is to rid the world of
the deadly bolshevik menace of allout even suicidal nuclear
war but once that is done they know that there will be a day of
reckoning with the rockefeller cartel some day

   the rockefeller group is working toward a definite objective
with their new antinuclearwar propaganda  that objective is
renewed powerand power that moves them closer to their old
dream of world government  the bolsheviks here have unwittingly
provided fertile ground for the powerful new rockefeller antiwar
campaign  under bolshevik control the socalled reagan
administration has become so hawkish that it is scaring people 
the rockefeller antiwar campaign is designed to capitalize on
that latent fear as a tool of power

   these days the smell of war is in the air  the falklands
crisis is helping to make that more intense  the rockefeller
propaganda machine is now paving the way for the argument that
surrender of sovereignty is the only way to avoid war  a new
superunited nations of sorts is now in the works to fill the
bill  it will have teeth  as presently envisioned the new
organization will be based in geneva switzerland  the working
name though this may be changed is the world nonproliferation
council  the plan is to bring it into being as the outgrowth of
nuclear nonproliferation treaties but its true purpose will be
to use fearthe fear of warto control us all

                       last minute summary

   now it is time for my last minute summary  in this audio
letter i have reported on the reasons behind the socalled
falkland islands crisis  the crisis erupted because of secret
bolshevikcontrolled naval installations in the southern
hemisphere  these have been attacked by joint action of the
rockefeller cartel and the russians in an attempt to slow down
the nuclearwar timetable  the attacks were successful but the
results remain to be seen  one result though is that the royal
navy has now been drawn into a trap  britains waterloo at sea
may well be at hand

   my friends two factions are struggling for control over our
united statesthe rockefeller cartel and the bolsheviks  they
differ in style but both seek to control us through fear  if we
are ever to rise above their trickery it must be through the
power of our lord jesus christ our only hope  as the scripture
tells us our lord has not given us the spirit of fear but
of power of love and of a sound mind  we must learn to wage
peace  as our lord declared long ago blessed are the
peacemakers for they shall be called sons of god

   until next month god willing this is dr beter  thank you
and may god bless each and every one of you

in article  maartenvanlooncwinl maarten van loon writes
hello fellownetters and fellow christians
about the subject of unity between christians and christian churches
to a bible study group alltough i do have a personal opinion on this
issue i thought it would be nice to hear opinions of fellow christian
brothers and sisters from different countries and in different situations

my background member of a orthodox reformed church let us say a little
the only unity i have found which is true is when all parties involved are
disciples  i came out of a church in which even the different
congregations were always competing and arguing about which one was
better and who had the better messages while none of them put anything
into practice from those messages  since becoming a disciple i have
found that when i travel to another church in the same movement they
are just as accepting there as any other  we had a retreat back in
january when some of the congregation from louisville ky came up this
retreat was for college students and it was as though i had known even
the people from louisville for years and i had only become a disciple
the previous april and had never been to the church in kentucky  one
of the keys to unity is unselfish love and selfsacrifice  that is only
one area in which disciples stand out from christians  also another
part of unity is a common depth of conviction  i have also been a part of
some christian campus fellowships who were focused on unity between
churches and saw that those churches had one thing involved  a lack of
conviction about everything they believed  that was why they could be
unified they did not care about the truth but delighted in getting along
together

the problem here in the netherlands is that there are two other churches
denominations with the same characteristics both have the same
confessions there are only some differences with respect to  for
example  the matter of appropriation of salvation and how to use
our creeds in essence a lot of people of these three churches have to
same faith and feel that they should become one church but how that is
the question

creeds  what need is there of creeds when the bible stands firmly
better

so here is a first question
 can the congregation of christ be separated by walls of different
  denominations or is this definitely an untolerable situation
  according to the scriptures

according to the scriptures splits and differences of opinion are going
to be there  as per a previous note i mentioned that there are those
who teach falsely by many means  there are also differences of opinion
and belief  however scripture states  
   in the following directives i have no praise for you for your
meetings do more harm than good  in the first place i hear that when
you come together as a church there re divisions among you and to some
extent i believe it  no doubt there have to be differences among you to
show which of you have gods approval one corinthians elevenseventeennineteen

how will god show his approval  by fruitfulness see acts twofortyseven but
before that there are these qualities
   devotion to the apostles teaching
   fellowship
   communion
   filling with awe for god
   all having everything in common
   glad and sincere hearts
   praising god
   enjoying the favor of the people
all these are mentioned in acts twofortytwofortyseven  god also shows that those who
have these qualities are persecuted  look at stephen a man full of
faith and of the holy spirit acts sixfive who was later stoned acts
sevenfiftyfoursixty  

 can one say that only one of these three churches is the
  true church of jesus christ

one can say that a church is the true church only if that church is
perfect not only in the congregation but worldwide as a movement  i
have yet to find that but the closest one i have found is the boston
church of christ movement which constantly strives to have errors
pointed out and corrected  it is also the only one i have seen which is
totally sold out to god


a problem closely related to these question is
 can we cooperate with other christians  from these two churches  
  before there is a unity this question is especially important
  for those who think that only one church can be the true one

as for cooperation that can always occur  unity on the other hand may
never occur  as for those who think about only one church being the
true one i remind them that mark ninethirtyeightfortyone states that there are
disciples who are not a part of the main group to begin with but they
will not lose their reward  as with the boston movement i have heard
numerous times this exact same thing that there are disciples out there
that are not a part of the boston movement but that does not make them
any less disciples  of course few people admit that they have ever run
into someone who has the qualities of a disciple outside the movement
i know i have not

maybe this last problem sounds a little strange to most of you
for your information we have a lot of organizations here which
are founded by people of one specific church and whose members
are all members of that church this has been considered as
correct for years only a few years ago people started to
discuss about this and now we are in the middle of this process
some organizations are opening their doors for people from
other churches etc

i must warn that this sounds cliquey to me  a clique is a group which
runs around together to some extent exclusively  this causes problems
in fellowship and causes divisions  i would not say at all that this is
something correct for a churchgroup to do for any reason  in one of
the churches i attended for example there was an internal clique of
people who were on the fourteen different groupscommitteesorganizational
heads of the congregation  they rarely talked to anyone else outside of
the committees and seldom were voted out of office without another
office being opened up so that they would have to step right back in
their degree of exclusion was such that when the new pastor came he
nearly had to wipe out everything and start from scratch i wish he
would have since they still have no clue about what it means to be a
disciple  anyway this rigidity in the clique is beginning to be
broken down but is still there  so i must warn against such division
within  there is enough division without

thanks for your opinions in advance

subject re my gun is like my american express card
organization university of tennessee division of continuing education
lines one hundred and thirtyfour

in article  thomas parsli  writes
overall crime rate
it felljust like that

       two questions  when was this and do you have the relevant
numbers  please note this is not in any way an indication i do not
believe you or that you are not correct but when the drop occured is
relevant
   
acquiring weapons in norway
you can buy almost all kinds of weapons in norway but you must have a 
permit and a good reason to get the permit
if i would like to have a handgun i would have to get an gunlicence from 
the police and to be a member of a gunclub

       the primary objection beyond ones based on the ideal of
rkba that it is simply not something the government should do is
that it makes guns a plaything and tool of the rich and connected
it discriminates against the poor

       is selfdefense considered appropriate and if so under what
conditions  are you allowed for instance to get a gun for protection
if you are going to be carrying a very large sum of money on a regular
basis or have been threatened

the police would check my criminal records for any serious crimes andor
records of serious mental diseases

       this has been suggested in the yous and generally supported among
gun owners  what many object to is that many if not most proposals
contain a sort of gotcha clause which allows an arbitrary denial even
if you qualify in every way

now if a got my licence i would have to be an active member of the gun
club for six months before i could collect my gun
it is a little like getting a drivers licence is not it 
you have to prove that you can drive before you are allowed to

       at this point it should be pointed out that in general
a drivers licence in the yous is for the most part nothing like its
european counterpart  i understand getting one is far more difficult
there than here  in the yous it is a joke 

       but my usual objection is that you are discussing two different
things  for instance in the yous a drivers license is a permit
to operate a motor vehicle on a public road  it is not necessary
to own one or to operate it on private property  that is the
ability to require driving permits is generally considered to arise
from the governments legitimate power to enact reasonable regulations
for behavior on public lands  a permit to own an automobile for instance
which is far closer an analogy would be a much harder thing to get
past legally since it would not be based on making regulations on public
property but in restricting activity on private property              

use of guns in crimes in norway
some crimes are commited with guns that have been in the owners arms
for a long time but these are rather the exeption
most criminals accuire guns to use them in crimes and mostly short 
time befor the crime

use of knives
it is allowed to cary knifes in public but not in your belt or open
you americans think it is ok to have a gun but not to carry it open
in public rigth 

        this varies widely  one thing i think europeans have
a difficult time with is that the yous has fifty unique jurisdictions
where the laws from one state to another can be as radically different
as from one country in europe to another

        some places allow open carry of both guns and knives  some allow
concealed  some prohibit both or allow one or the other  and it can
be either a state or local restriciton       

individual vs masses
yes the individual is more important than the masses but only to some
extent
your criminal laws are to protect the individuals who makes the masses 
what happens when the rigths of some individuals affects the rights of 
all the others 

       the question must be asked  is the right of this individual
affecting the rights of this other individual  what we usually
get is that the rights of this group meaning some individuals within
this group here defined as people who own guns are adversely affecting 
the rights of some other group  

       if for instance bob were using his gun to attack steve you would
have a point  but essentially what we are discussing is that becuase
some person who qualifies as a member of the group people who own
guns then some third person perhaps in another time zone is told
that their being a member of that group is taking away somebody elses
rights  it is like trying to punish all newspapers for the libel commited
by one

the issue
i believe the issue is guns and gunlegislation

       the issue is crime violence and murder  the question is to
what extent guns and gun legislation impact those

we should not mix weapons and items that can serve as one
if i lived in amerika i would probably have a gun to defend myselfe in home
but should it have to be like that 

       of course not  it would be nice if we did not have to fear that
other people might get it into their twisted little minds to hurt us
but currently we do not have that option  nor do i expect we will

do you think it is wise to sell guns like candy some states do 

       no state does  in any case there is a limit to which the state
may enforce it is wisdom on me  freedom in general is an unwise
concept  if you preemptively restrict everything which might be
unwise then freedom becomes a meaningless concept
   
if you believe it is smartneccacery to have driverslicence why do you think
it should be free to buy guns 

       i will raise my hand against drivers licenses  as currently
implemented they are a waste of time and little more than revanue
generation for the state and ignored by a startling number of
drivers  it does not guarantee a level of skill any higher than is
necessary to get your car on the road and get yourself or somebody
else killed or a knowledge of traffic laws beyond what any ten year
old will have picked up riding around in his parents car

       but as i mentioned they are two different things

i would be concerned about how the car was driven and how well it was
maintained  i own a turbocharged one and i would never buy a
turbocharged vehicle unless i knew the owner and hisher
drivingmaintenance habits

question is that the ninetyone tsi awd was mentioned in the
april consumer reports to a car to avoid

i have been wondering about that myself  the ninety awd models and the
ninetyones were identical except for the abs option  

in particular the manual transmission

yes  some owners had problems with the transaxles  using
synthetic lubricants in the transaxles solved the problem in most
cases  the problem was not unique to the awds however  it was
common to all models  the galant vrfour and gsx had the same transaxle
but i did not see those listed in cr

electrical system

i do not know of any major complaints in this area except that the
battery that was installed at the factory had a low current rating 

and brakes were below par in both models

the first fwd models those built before may one thousand nine hundred and eightynine were recalled for
brake upgrades  some fwd and awd owners had problems with warped
rotors  those of us who insist on using manual torque wrenches every
time the lug nuts are tightened have never had a problem

a friend of mine
ownes a ninety tsi awd and he has had two brake jobs pads

i can refer you to someone who has gone through a set of pads in one
day  it all depends on how you drive  it seems that most owners have
been getting between fortyseventyk on a set of pads

one stuck valve

first time i hear about a problem with the valve train on these cars
other than timing belt failures

and some clutchtransmission problem something
about stickinggrinding into second gear  this does not seem
too bad if one beats on his car

if your friend beats on the car then his unit is not a
representative sample of the cars reliability

my suggestion is instead of listening to the useless consumer reports
talk to several owners the mailing list may be the best way to reach
a few of them

i am willing to suffer reliabilityfor speed and looks  seems
you have to pay big buck if you want all three  anyway can

imho it does not really matter who started any individual battle within
the arabsisreal war context the real question is whowhat  started the
war does anyone have any doubts it was the creation of israel on arab
land 

       huh  a war was started when several armies invaded israel
vowing to drive the jews into the sea  most jews wanted to live in
peace and the arabs who stayed in israel were granted citizenship

it depends entirely on how you define war the actual fighting largely
predates the arab invasions  after all deir yassin happened in midapril
well before the arab invasion as i have said elsewhere lt col lorch has
said that hagana forces were fighting well before the arabs invaded as in
months before as for jews wanting to live in peace that to is entirely
arguable i think it is easy enough to show that the labour party leadership
had no such intention at all as for the arabs who stayed do not you mean
those who were not expelled even some of those who did stay were not
granted citizenship but expelled after the fighting had stopped anyway

joseph askew


how do you define war  do seiges and constant attacks on villiages
count as acts of war or is that only when the jews do them
january one thousand nine hundred and fortyeight arab liberation army attacks kfar szold
               one thousand men attack kfar etzion fourteen miles south of jerusalem
                    after cutting off the supply lines to it
attacks on yehiam western galilee and kibbutz tirat tzvi
by midmarch the jewish settlements in the negev had been cut off from
      land links with the rest of the jewish population
         the etzion group of villiages near hebron had been cut off
            while fortytwo members of a convoy trying to supply yehiam were
            slaughtered cutting off the villiage
jerusalem was under seige being cut off from its supply route from
     tel aviv the bombed out supply trucks have been left on the side
     of that road to this day in memoriam  by this time one thousand two hundred jews 
     had been killed

of course this is not war since it is only the arabs attacking
just like last week when the fatah launched katyusha rockets
against northern israel  where does uprising end and war begin

i use desqviewx and i think it is great where it really shines imho is
to let unix users log into a pc and run dos and windows applications with
the display going to their screens
you will need to get
desqviewx v oneone
desqviewx v oneone                           two hundred and seventyfive suggested retail
desqviewx to other x systems v oneone        two hundred suggested retail

you also must be running a supported network ftp softwares pctcp
novell lan workplace for dos sun microsystems pcnfs beame and whiteside
wollongong pathway tcpip or hp microsoft lan manager

if you do not have any of this network stuff quarterdeck will give you a
copy of novell tcpip transprot for dos with the network manager

you can get more info by sending email to appropriately infoqdeckcom

actually infoqdeckcom is our customer service department if you have
technical questions you can write to supportqdeckcom

in my opinion if you want to have other people logging in and running
applications at your pc you will want to have a four hundred and eightysix thirtythree with sixteen megs of ram
also the xwindows software in desqviewx really seems to like an et four thousand
tseng labs chipset based graphics card personally i found that things
ran better with a scsi drive in the pc than with esdi drives but that is
my experience only

what sort of traffic is generated with the xcalls  i am curious to find
out the required bandwidth that a link must have  if one machine running
dvx is supporting multiple users clients and we require adequate response
time  anyone have any ideas   

i expect the limiting factor will be your server machine not the network
itself to give you a realworld example here at quarterdeck we have
roughly one hundred people using dvx to talk to a bunch of unix boxes novell
file servers and each other it is not too much of a load on our
ethernet with maybe four concentrators so you have twentythirty people on each
segment if you had a badly loaded net or the apps you wanted to run
were very network intensive you could run into some slowdowns

but the biggest problem would be the machine itself say you have a four hundred and eightysix
thirtythree with plenty of ram and a fast hard disk and network card if you have
ten people running programs off it you are going to see some slowdowns
because you are now on effectively a threethree mhz four hundred and eightysix of course dvx will
attempt to see if tasks are idle and make sure they give up their time
slice but if you have ten working programs running you will know it

having said that if you can tweak the programs being run by adding
in calls to give up time slices when idle and that sort of
thing you could probably run fifteentwenty people on a given machine before
you started seeing slowdowns again this time from network bandwidth
it all really depends on what the programs are doing ie you are going
to see a slowdown from xbandwidth a lot sooner if your apps are all
doing network things also

the idea of the card is bull in and of its self but i am curious to know do 
they plan on making it a requirement to always have it on you or is it 
only going to be required to be presented when trying to ge medical aid

this at least has already been determined the blue cross medical
coverage for all federal employees is a good model for a future
national system to get emergency medical care anyone so insured
must always carry their blue cross card before entering a hospital
you must notify blue cross or they will refuse to pay your bills 
in an emergency where you must be treated before notifying them 
you must inform them within twentyfour hours or if you are unable to do
so for medical reasons the hospital must failing to do so within
twentyfour hours means they will not cover the hospitalization in you need
your card to notify them and without the card the hospital certainly
would not know they had to therefore you are required to carry
the card at all times or do without emergency medical coverage

hi all

i really thought that by now i would have seen something
about this but i have not so here goes  last night on
the evening news the anchorperson said something to the
effect that one of the ssrbs that was recovered after the
recent space shuttle launch was found to have a wrench of
some sort rattling around apparently inside the case  there
was no elaboration as to where specfically the item was
found of what type of wrench it was but the anchorperson
did say something about a nasa official commenting that
there would be an inquiry into how the thing got in the ssrb

has anybody else on the net whose info sources may be 
better than mine heard anything about this  it seems rather

plus questions for you  why do subjectivistsrelativistsnihilists get so 
het up about the idea that relativism is better than objectivism 

to the degree that relativism is a more accurate decription of the
truth than is objectivism it provides more power and ability to
control events

assuming for the moment that morals are relative then two
relativists can recognize that neither has a lock on the absolute
truth and they can proceed to negotiate a workable compromise that
produces the desired results

assuming that there is an absolute morality two disagreeing 
objectivists can either be both wrong or just one of them right there
is no room for compromise  once you beleive in absolute morals
you must accept that you are amoral or that everyone who disagrees
with you is amoral

given a choice between a peaceful compromise or endless contention
i would say that compromise seems to be better

the point being that what people say and what they acutally do
may be different

it is interesting that this clip from the newspaper did not

i would say that one innocent person killed is in some sense
as bad as many   we certainly feel that way when we punish
someone for a single murder
now if we reform system x by reducing the number of deaths
by one we produce system xx    i would say we should not go back
to system x even though by doing so we would reintroduce only 
a single extra death

bob seems to think that one is as bad as many in a sense somewhat stronger than
the one you indicate


  yes i do  

  my argument is that the sole purpose of the death penalty is to
  kill people  that is it is primary and i would argue only
  purpose  to continue to kill people by a practice that has
  almost no utility especially when you know you will be killing
  innocents is unconscionable

  at the very least the existence of the prison system and our
  transportation system are based on their merits to society not
  their detriments  we are willing to accept a few lost innocent
  lives because there is an overwhelming benefit to the continued
  existence of these systems  one has to stretch the evidence and
  the arguments to make the same claim for capital punishment

  just in case i was not clear again  we maintain a capital
  punsihment system that kills innocent people and provides us with
  no net positive gain  why

  were you to pin me in a corner and ask i would have to respond
  that i do not belief the state should have the right to take life
  at all  but i will not open that debate as it seems others are
  tiring of this thread on aa anyway

subject lezgians astir in azerbaijan and daghestan
summary asking not to fight against armenians in karabakh  for unification
organization sdpa center for regional studies
lines one hundred and six


fournineteenone thousand nine hundred and ninetythree zero  lezghis astir

by nejla sammakia
 associated press writer
   
gussar azerbaijan ap  the six hundredzero lezghis of azerbaijan and russia have
begun clamoring for their own state threatening turmoil in a tranquil corner 
of the caucasus

the region has escaped the ethnic warfare of neighboring nagornokarabakh
abkhazia and ossetia but lezhgis could become the next minority in the former
soviet union to fight for independence

lezghis who are muslim descendents of nomadic shepherds are angry about the
conscription of their young men to fight in azerbaijans fiveyearold undeclared
war with armenia

they also want to unite the lezghi regions of azerbaijan and russia which
were effectively one until the breakup of the soviet union created national
borders that had been only lines on a map

a rally of more than threezero lezghis in march to protest conscription and
demand a separate lezghistan alarmed the azerbaijani government

officials in baku the capital deny rumors that police shot six
demonstrators to death but the government announced strict security measures
and began cooperating with russian authorities to control the movement of
lezhgis living across the border in the dagestan region of russia

visitors to gussar the center of lezhgi life found the town quiet soon
after the protest children played outdoors in the crisp mountain air

at the sunday bazaar men in heavy coats and dark fur hats gathered to
discuss grievances ranging from high customs duties at the russian border to a
war they say is not theirs

i have been drafted but i will not go said shamil kadimov gold teeth
glinting in the sun why must i fight a war for the azerbaijanis i have
nothing to do with armenia

more than threezero people have died in the war which centers on the disputed
territory of nagornokarabakh about one hundred and fifty miles to the southeast

malik kerimov an official in the mayors office said only eleven of three hundred locals
drafted in one thousand nine hundred and ninetytwo had served

the police do not force people to go he said they are afraid of an
uprising that could be backed by lezghis in dagestan

all the men agreed that police had not fired at the demonstrators but
disagreed on how the protest came about

some said it occurred spontaneously when rumors spread that azerbaijan was
about to draft onefive hundred men from the gussar region where seventyfivezero lezghis live

others said the rally was ordered by gen muhieddin kahramanov leader of the
lezhgi underground separatist movement sadval based in dagestan

we organized the demonstration when families came to us distraught about
draft orders said kerim babayev a mathematics teacher who belongs to sadval

we hope to reunite peacefully by approaching everyone  the azerbaijanis 
the russians

in the early eighteenth century the lezhgis formed two khanates or sovereignties
in what are now azerbaijan and dagestan they roamed freely with their sheep
over the green hills and mountains between the two khanates

by one thousand eight hundred and twelve the lezghi areas were joined to czarist russia after one thousand nine hundred and seventeen they
came under soviet rule with the disintegration of the soviet union the 
six hundredzero lezghis were faced for the first time with strict borders

about half remained in dagestan and half in newly independent azerbaijan

we have to pay customs on all this on cars on wine complained mais
talibov a small trader his goods laid out on the ground at the bazaar
included brandy stomach medication and plastic shoes from dagestan

we want our own country he said we want to be able to move about easily
but baku will not listen to us

physically it is hard for outsiders to distinguish lezhgis from other
azerbaijanis in many villages they live side by side working at the same 
jobs and intermarrying to some degree

but the lezhgis have a distinctive language a mixture of arabic turkish and
persian with strong guttural vowels

azerbaijan officially supports the cultural preservation of its ten largest
ethnic minorities the lezghis have weekly newspapers and some elementary 
school classes in their language

autonomy is a different question if the lezghis succeeded in separating from
azerbaijan they would set a precedent for other minorities such as the 
talish in the south the tats in the nearby mountains and the avars of eastern
azerbaijan

why anyone would order an sho with an automatic transmission is
beyond me if you cannot handle a stick you should stick with a

say that there are not real drivers who cannot use the stick eg
disabled persons but they are not in any position to use an
sho anyway 

i would be willing to bet that if we removed the automatic
transmissions from all performancetype cars like the fivezerol
mustangs camaros and the like we would cut down on the number of
accidents each year autos are fine for sedate little sedans
but they have no business in performance cars imho

i have to disagree with this  i have a ninetytwo ztwentyeight with a three hundred and fifty and a fourspeed auto
w overdrive and it is really better that way  chevy autos are reknowned
for their long life and ability to handle copious amount of power  i live 
in the dallas area and a manual would be much harder to drive in the traffic 
here  now if i still lived out in the sticks like i used to a manual would be
more fun  

safetywise an auto is less distractingi would hate to have to be    
shifting gears while i was trying to ease into traffic in the freeways here
performancewise i can hold my own against any stock fivezero mustang or fivezero
camaro w a five speed  

all of this imho 

all of my hos disagree with your hos  i loved dallas rush hour in my stick
detested it in the autolike i did any other time in the auto  of course
dalls rush hours are nothing from what i hearif i lived in la i might
be of a different persuasion  and just for the record rarely do you shift
gears when merging into trafficthat is what five speeds are good forfourth is
good up through around eightyninety most of the time so you can just wind it out
it is not going to hurt anything and keeps it in the powerband anyway
only shift into top gear when you are exceeding redline in fourthfairly rare
unless you drive a ferrari or some such i would bet or when you hit cruising

 top ten signs that it is the age of aquarius on pennsylvania avenue



ten men in uniform are persona non grata in the home of our commander in
    chief

nine  algores enviromentalism will make the clean air act look like an
    industrial policy

eight  higher taxes are once again the prescription for all that ails america

seven  tax dodging is unpatriotic draft dodging is a symbol of pride

six  beaded curtains hang from the oval office windows

five  socialism may be dead in the exsoviet union but we are told to prepare
    for the nationalization of our health care resources these people
    must be inhaling something

four  not quite free love but eating flowers is considered healthy

three  the feminazis have a president in the white house whether the rest of
    us realize it or not

two  slick may be the first draft dodger to send american troops into
    combat

one  slick may be unpopular with middleclass americans but he is a big hit
    on campus with the professorial class



copyright c edward a ipser jr one thousand nine hundred and ninetythree


here is my own top ten response to mr ipsers list


ten  it is about time we have a president that might actually stand up to the
     military  our men and women in uniform must learn that the world does not
     revolve around them and that one of the things they are out there defending
     is our right to be critical of them even denounce them

nine   let me explain something to you  environmental policy and industrial
     policy must go hand in hand  our nation and indeed our planet cannot
     afford to continue ignoring this as was done over the last twelve years
     our industrialenvironmental position has been downright shameful we
     must have active government support of the key industries such as
     telecommunications microelectronics medical biotech and environmental
     tech  meanwhile weed out old inneficient highpolution industries
     that are better left to other nations  this will make us richer help
     produce new jobs and help the environment  to give credit where credit
     is due i heard a lot of this in a speech by senator john kerry dma
     tonite  in addition it is time we get really really serious about 
     issues like overpopulation globabl warming and ozone depletion  the
     planet on which we live should be our utmost priority

eight   it just so happens that that it takes money to make this country work
     to provide the services that people need and to help solve the problems
     that need to be solved  granted some things can probably be done more
     efficiently for less money and should be  but some things are going to
     cost more money and i am sick and tired of hearing everyone whining about
     taxes all the time  you want to live in my country you pay your fair
     share

seven   i cannot believe what hypocrites people are when they ask people to give
     up their lives for their country and then complain about taxes  if you are
     willing to send me off to die for some stupid obsession with fighting an
     enemy which at best does not affect us and at worst really should be our
     friend then you have no right to tell me you should not pay taxes

six   hey i think the beaded curtains add a lovely sixtysesque touch

five   look canada europe and japan manage to provide health care for their
     citizens and yes basic health is a human right which people are
     entitled to  if these nations are not capitalist enough for you then
     i guess we have found something better than capitalism  there is nothing
     sacred about the capitalist system and if something be it socialism
     or anything else works better then i say let capitalism die

four   make love not war

three   contrary to popular belief it is possible to be a male and a feminist
     at the same time  to discriminate against or to deny equal opportunity
     to a majority of the population is just plain wrong and trying to force
     them into some sort of tradition role is even worse  women certainly 
     have as much to offer this world as men and the day that gender
     discrimination is finally broken it going to make all the revolutions of
     the past few centuries seem like reform bills  i look forward to it

two   see number ten

 now  you can try to tell me that it was not scientific enough and
 that i have not proven beyond the shadow of a doubt that i have a

 know that i do not wish to get sick from eating food thank you very
 much  
 
if you could not tell which one had message why restaurants bother to
use it at all 

if you can taste the difference psychological reaction might play a role

the fact is message is part of natural substance everyone i mean everyone
consumes certain amount of message every day through regular diet without
the synthesized message additive

chinese and many other asians japanese koreans etc have used
message as flavor enhancer for two thousand years do you believe that
they knew how to make message from chemical processes not they just
extracted it from natural food such sea food and meat broth

how can i
 get round the problem

does the workstation you are using have hardware cursor support  or does
the server generate a software cursor  you can generally tell the difference
just by using it  if the cursor blinks a lot when there is screen activity
it is probably a software cursor  if it has a hardware cursor i think you are
probably battling a bug in hps x server  i am not familiar with any hardware
cursor chips that display cursors greater than sixtyfourxsixtyfour  it is quite possible
that the server is just echoing your preferred cursor size without actually
checking it  i vaguely recall that very old mit server revisions did just 
that

in reality you are probably stuck with a sixtyfourxsixtyfour maximum size cursor regardless
of what the server returns

getting back to the original question in this thread

i experienced breathing difficulties a few years ago similar to those
described  in my case it turned out that i was developing type i
diabetes  although i never sought direct confirmation of this from my
doctor i think that the breathing problem was associated with the
presence of ketones due to the diabetes

i think that ketosis can occur in lesser degree if one is restricting
their food intake drastically  i do not know if this relevant in this
case but you might ask your daughter if she has been eating
properly

did anyone notice the words not for baseball printed on the picture
of joe robbie stadium in the opening day season preview section in usa
today any reason given for this

also i just noticed something looking at the nolan ryan timeline in
the preview on eighttwentytwoeightynine rickey henderson became nolans five thousandth strikeout
on sixelevenninety he pitched his sixth nohitter against oakland i believe the
last out in the game was made by rickey henderson and on fiveoneninetyone nolan
pitched his seventh nohitter on the same day a certain someone stole his
nine hundred and thirtynineth base which overshadowed it it seems that nolan is having a lot of
publicity at rickeys expense i am going to rickey deserves it and it seems as
most of the net agrees with me from what i have seen on it lately they are
both great players but i am going to nolan has outclassed rickey both in playing
and more importantly in attitude just my thoughts

i currently have novell netware lite which does not work with

i am considering moving all our machines to wfourwg

qone  how much conventional ram does wfourwg use over and above the
     driver for the network card

qtwo  if i have a novell netwo thousand card are the lsl and ipx drivers
     still needed

qthree  does wfourwg do a license check over the network to ensure each
     machine is running its own licenced copy of wfourwg note i do
     not want to break the license agreement and i will buy a copy
     of wfourwg for each of our machines it is just that i would like
     to try it out first to see if it meets our needs returning one
     opened copy is much easier than returning n opened copies

qfour  if you buy the upgrade to windows threeone for wfourwg does it replace

i have an sethirty with a eighty meg hd which dates back to april one thousand nine hundred and eightynine  when i
originally purchased it i experienced the failure to boot problem  this
was fixed soon after by a rom upgrade on the hard drive

lately a similar problem has been occuring  when the computer is
powered on the hd light flashes a few times and then i am given
the no disk to boot from icon  however upon turing the
computer off and on again the drive always boots up just fine  
furthermore if instead of turning the power on and off i press the reboot 
button the same problem occurs  but as i said turning the power
off and on always works

this problem is different from the one thousand nine hundred and eightynine boot problem in that before
it often required several power off and ons to get it to boot

does anybody have any suggestions as to what the problem is or how
it can be fixed

i am wondering if it is getting old and requires more time to 
come up to speed now  is there a pram or scsi setting that
allows me to tell the computer to wait a little longer before 
trying to access the hd

i have seen were eight hundred and eighty and nine hundred and fifty but i have also heard of eight hundred and ninety and nine hundred and forty
i am not sure that the ten nm one way or another will make a great deal of

	another suggestion  find a brand of tv that uses an ir remote

that have been pinched in the middle does anybody know what the
actual purpose of those things are i hear that they are called
cooling towers but what the heck do they cool
i hope someone can help 


the actual hourglass is hollow and is designed to generate a draft
exploiting the venturi effect  around the base of the hourglass is a
ring of water towers  warm river water coming from the steam condenser
in the plant is sprayed over louvres  the draft being pulled through
the tower cools the water by both evaporation and convection  the
sensible heat extracted from the cooling water is the driving force for
draft generation

it should be noted that the hourglassshaped cooling towers are used on
both fossile and nuclear plants  it should also be noted that at 
locations where water is plentiful the cooling towers are only used part
time when the discharge temperature would exceed some release limit
it was once thought that the warm discharge water was damaging to fish
fishermen know that is thoroughly incorrect  nontheless stringent
usually state regulations remain in some instances  since it typically
takes sixtyzero hp worth of pumping to move the volume of water needed 
to cool a one thousand mwe plant the cost of using the towers is not insignificant

we are just completing a project on nebuliser performance and have a
wealth of data on particle size and output which we are going to use
to adjudicate a contract next week

although the output data is easy for us to present there seems to be
little concensus on the optimum diameter of the nebulised droplets for
straightforward inhalation therapy eg for asthmatics

some say that the droplets must be smaller than five microns whilst
others say that if they are too small they will not be effective

articleid indyvaxone thousand nine hundred and ninetythreeaprtwentytwoone hundred and sixtytwo thousand five hundred and oneseven hundred and fortyseven
lines ten

in my first posting on this subject i threw out an idea of how to fund
such a contest without delving to deep into the budget  i mentioned
granting mineral rights to the winner my actual wording was mining
rights  somebody pointed out quite correctly that such rights are
not anybodys to grant although i imagine it would be a fait accompli
situation for the winner  so how about this  give the winning group
i cannot see one company or corp doing it a ten twenty or fifty year
moratorium on taxes

organization simon fraser university burnaby bc canada
lines forty

ecktonsucsbyuedu sean eckton writes

i have a microsoft serial mouse and am using mousecom eightzero was using eighttwenty 
i think but switched to eightzero to see if it was any better  vertical motion 
is nice and smooth but horizontal motion is so bad i sometimes cannot click 
on something because my mouse jumps around  i can be moving the mouse to 
the right with relatively uniform motion and the mouse will move smoothly 
for a bit then jump to the right then move smoothly for a bit then jump 
again maybe this time to the left about five inch  this is crazy  i have 
never had so much trouble with a mouse before  anyone have any solutions  

try this  flip your mouse over and open up the cover that holds the
mouse ball in place  remove the ball and inside you should see
probably three rollers  if any of the rollers have a tiny layer of
cakedon dirt dust or otherwise unidentifiable scum on them carefully
scrape it off with a small knife xacto works great  be careful
you do not want to gauge the rollers just clean off the dirt
put the ball back in put the cover on and there you are  

i clean a couple of dozen of these every month here  another symptom
is that when you move the mouse it seems to click along  if this
does not solve your problem at least you have a clean mouse  i highly
recommend using a proper soft mouse pad and if you are a clean freak
place it in your drawer every night or when you do not use it to keep
the dust off

personally i prefer track balls  oh which brings me to another point
if your mouse or trackball tracks optically and the sunlight is 
streaming through the window onto your mousetrackball you may notice
that it will stop working  if this happens to you close the curtains
or blinds or simply shade your pointing device and see if that helps

i would like to take the liberty to quote from a christian writer named 
ellen g white  i hope that what she said will help you to edit your 
remarks in this group in the future

do not set yourself as a standard  do not make your opinions your views 
of duty your interpretations of scripture a criterion for others and in 
your heart condemn them if they do not come up to your ideal
                         thoughts fromthe mount of blessing p one hundred and twentyfour

i hope quoting this does not make the atheists gag but i think ellen white 
put it better than i could

bobby mozumder

my point is that you set up your views as the only way to believe  saying 
that all eveil in this world is caused by atheism is ridiculous and 
counterproductive to dialogue in this newsgroups  i see in your posts a 
spirit of condemnation of the atheists in this newsgroup bacause they don
t believe exactly as you do  if you are here to try to convert the atheists 
here you are failing miserably  who wants to be in position of constantly 
defending themselves agaist insulting attacks like you seem to like to do
i am sorry you are so blind that you did not get the messgae in the quote 
everyone else has seemed to

many people would probably think especially if the fanatics propogandized
this that this was a conflict between the atheists and the religious
many would get the impression that we were trying to outlaw religion if
we contintue to try to remove all things with a religious reference
that is not what the people i have asked think perhaps you would be right
if you said the fundamentalists would think this way after all they think
they are being oppressed when they are not allowed to oppress however
you have not shown where you get this idea that many people would
probably think it is atheism vs religion winner take all as far as i can
tell it is your groundless prediction that this will happen

but you have not taken into the account of propoganda  remember if you
asked germans before wwii if the jews shoudl be slaughtered they would
probably answer no but after the propoganda machine rolled through at
least some were able to tolerate it

you see it only takes a small group of fanatics to whip up a general
frenzy

the propoganda machines have been in gear over a number of issues including
abortion and gays  look at some of the things that have happened
well so far they have passed one amendment which is currently under
intense scrutiny and they have failed to outlaw abortion which is their
prime goal on that issue yep they seem sooo effective sure

well they have not managed to outlaw abortion due to the possible objectivity
of the courts  but they have managed to create quite a few problems for
people that wanted to have an abortion  they could create similar problems
for us  and it could be worse  they can try to stop abortions by blocking
clinics etc but imagine what they would have to do to stop atheism

besides the margin of error is very large when you only talk to two people
better than your one that is your opinion also i have branched
out and the informal survey is up over half a dozen now
and what have they said  were you questions unbiased
keith you would claim that my questions are biased the minute i posted
them because the answers agreed with me everyone i have asked about
the possible removal of the motto the christian portion has expressed
regret about its loss because they like it however when it is pointed
out to them that a new motto will not be in the works none have expressed
the desire to rape murder pillage etc which you have basically claimed

so you are able to convince them individually but could you convince a
whole room of them  a whole nation

as for the atheist portion i know some around here they have all
expressed disgust with the motto some noted being harassed by christians
who used the motto to try to seem justified and all would see it gone

yes i would be glad if it were gone to  i have never supported it  however
i think that it is a minor problem that can be easily ignored contrasted
with what could happen an what may be likely

which christians designed the motto  does the motto say anything about
jesus  why do you think that it refers only to christians
christians wrote it christians think that their religion is right and
all others are wrong therefore why would they include other religions
in the realm of being correct i doubt that any other religions were meant
to be included

well i am not clear on the religious convictions of francis scott key the
motto can be attributed to him but it is at least clear that he believed
in a god  and surely there are a few christians that think as you say
but i do not think that most do  do you think that all christians actively
despise other religions  most that i have met have not and do not do so

no christian
that i have queried thinks it means anything but them and only them
why not ask some people of other faiths
sorry i would but christianity is just so awfully popular around here
suppose you could ask a few people

well i have asked a hindu moselem and a few jews and all of them think
that it is applicable to them  of course i cannot say that these people
just some that i know pretty well are accurate representations of their
faiths

it is always a good idea to assume that there were dissenting views on any
given issue  you are assuming that all the views were the same and nothing
leads to this conclusion
without evidence to the contrary i doubt that there were dissenting
opinions you claim there were provide some evidence for your assertion

well i would really like to and i have tried but i really do not know where to
get access to congressional records from the one thousand nine hundred and fiftys  can anyone help
out here

comparing christians to nazis interesting

only in the sense that neither can probably convinced to change their beliefs

no again the motto on the money does not cost you anything extra  however
if you abolished the motto we would all have to pay to have all the dies and
plates redone
like people paid before to get them changed to have the motto on them
you now need to show that there is a good reason to change everything again

 also i doubt that they use ththree
same plates for more than a years printing this would make it easy
to remove the motto simply make next years plates without it your
claim evidently is that they will have to pay extra somewhere
provide some evidence for this assertion

so are you saying that they redesign the plates each year

anyway your whole argument conveniently deleted i see was that the motto
somehow costs us all a lot of money  this is just not correct

the ones i read did not mention anything about jesus  i think the issue was
concerning the distinction between religion and not
how could it be between religious and not religious the motto
refers to god it is a religious motto the question is whether or
not it is only christian you say it is more i doubt this provide
some evidence for this assertion

that is to say the religion of this country and the nonreligion of
the ussr  that was what most of those quotes were about and some included
all atheists in general as well  i do not think that any of the quotes
although i seem to have lost them mentioned anything at all about jesus
they advocated religion over nonreligion  a specific religion was not
mentioned

you have missed this point  i said that the motto did not say anything
about anyone in particular  that is the motto does not imply anything
about your particular beliefs  it does not say that everyone trusts
in some form of god only that the nation on the whole does
we have been through this before it is obvious it does not include me
this much is beyond doubt your claim again is that the motto refers
to more than christians based on the facts that christianity says all
other religions are wrong and because it seems that the motto was
written by christians i doubt your claim

so you are saying that all christians must believe that all other religions
should be outlawed just because they think they are wrong  that is silly
i think the flatearthers are wrong but i do not advocate their banishment

  based on this idea i doubt that any additional expense would
even be incurred by removing the motto provide some evidence for your
claim that it would

i think that any such cost would be insignificant  i mentioned the slight
cost because you said that the motto was costing us a lot of money by
being on our currency

disregarding the digression of the other mottoif it is used for
harassment and no other purpose has been found for it why should
it not be removed

well mottos in general do not really have purposes  i do not think it
should be removed because i think the benefit would be outweighed by the
consequences

and do you know what the vote was  were there other opinions  do you
think that the main reason the motto was required by law was to bother
atheists  do you think that this is what the majority of congress at
the time had in mind  if you do then show why
again it is the opinion of the people who put it there that i am
concerned with

then you should be concerned with the opinion of the entire congress

again it is not necessary that the complete majority
shared the purpose of confronting godless communism with this motto

why not  it is the majority that put it there

the general public probably does not know about the antiatheist intent
of a few people in the fiftys either
i daresay more people remember the fiftys than the time when key wrote
the anthem

but do they remember the debate surrounding the motto  do they remember
that some people intended it to be a message against atheists  why do not
you include this in your little survey that you were conducting


you claim here that scientists would believe someone is claims i doubt
this provide evidence for your assertion

what  should i ask some scientists the probability that something einstein
said about relativity is worthy  i mean if einstein said it there is a
good chance that it was right at least at the time

as for the courts the
method scientists use can be applied i need not agree with the court
by default because of a good record

you need not agree with them all of the time but you would certainly think
that their decisions would be good evidence in favor of some point

what  but you said you did not agree with the court because they allowed
congress to attempt to make an amendment prohibiting flag burning  if
you do not realize that something like this is external to the realm of
the courts power then how can i be confident that you know anything
about the courts powers  i mean if you do not know how the court works
how can you participate in a discussion of the court
a judge can go to speak before congress and still you ignore the
abortion gag rule as you make your claims on abortion

no i think that it would be clearly inappropriate for a supreme court
justice to testify before congress during the consideration of a
constitutional amendment

and in order for the court to rule on something a case usually must be
presented

mushrooms flowers trees buildings signs whatever  the analogy is
the same  just because something that i might find offensive is present
does not mean that my rights are being violated
we are talking about something put there by people keithnot
a mushroom no one caused that mushroom to exist unless you are
finding things offensive in a mushroom farm

yes some mushrooms can be planted  and i do not appreciate mushrooms on
my pizza either

this is not the case
with the motto and you are ignoring the harassment which is the
only known result of the motto and you are ignoring that somewhere
along the line people were forced to put the motto there

who was forced to put the motto there  what do you mean

you will probably need to do something specific which will vary
depending upon your news software  clh

at any rate i need some support  much thanks to jayne k who is
already supporting me with kind words and prayers

i have been working at this company for eight years in various
engineering jobs  i am female  yesterday i counted and realized that
on seven different occasions i have been sexually harrassed at this
company  seven times eight years yesterday was the most recent one
someone left an xrated photo of a nude woman in my desk drawer

i am really upset by this  i suppose it could have been worse  it
could have been a man having sex with a sheep or something

there was no note  i do not know if it was

	 someone is idea of an innocent joke that went awry
	 someone is sick idea of flirting
	 an act of emotional terrorism that worked

i dreaded coming back to work today  what if my boss comes in to ask
me some kind of question i do not know the answer so i take a military
specification down off from my shelf to look up the answer and out
falls a picture of a man having sex with a sheep  i generally have a
bible on my desk for occasional inspiration what if i open it up to
corinthians and find a picture a la the north american man boy love
association  i want to throw up just thinking about this stuff

i can lock up my desk but i cannot lock up every book i have in the
office  i cannot trust that someone will not shove something into my
briefcase or my coat pocket when i am not looking so that i go home to
find such a picture or a threat or a raunchy note about what someone
wants to do to my body

to make it worse the entire department went out to lunch yesterday to
treat our marvelous secretary to lunch  the appointed hour for
leaving was eleventhirty  i was working in another building but wanted to go
to the lunch  so i returned at eleventwentyfive only to find that ever single
person had already left for lunch  they left at elevenfifteen or so  no one
could be bothered to call me at the other building even though my
number was posted  so i came back to a department that looked like a
neutron bomb had gone off and i was the sole survivor  this despite
the fact that everyone knew how bad i felt about this naked woman being
left in my desk drawer

i need some prayers  i cannot stop crying i am so deeply wounded
that it is ridiculous

i feel like i am some kind of subhuman piece of garbage for people to
reduce me and my sisters to simply sex organs and the sex act  i feel
like i am a subhuman piece of garbage that is not worthy of a simple
phone call saying we are leaving for marys lunch a little early so
that bob can get back for a big onezero meeting

please pray that my resentments will either go away or be miraculously
turned into something positive  please pray that whoever is torturing
me so will stop and find some healing for him or herself please pray
for my being healed from this latest wound which falls on top of a
whole slew of other wounds  please pray that i can find a new job
in a place where the corporate culture does its best to prevent such
harrassment from happening in the first place and swiftly acts
appropriately when something occurs despite its best precautions this
company in my opinion has pretty words about how sexual harrassment
is not tolerated but when you get right down to it how is it that one
female engineer can be touched inappropriately left obsene or
threatening notes left obscene pictures spoken to lewdly etc seven
times in eight years in the same place  pretty words from the company
do me no good when i am terrified or healing from the latest assault

and please pray that i do not turn into an automaton because of this
that is my bad habit ignore it and it will go away you are not worth
anyones time so do not go talking to anyone about this you are right
you are a subhuman piece of garbage and deserve to be treated this
way you are just an object you prostitute your mind to this
company so why cannot others expect you to prostitute your body there as
well what makes you think women are not just possessions and
nothing more than sex organs and their ability to perform the sex act
this is the kind of thinking that can catapault one into a major
depressive episode please pray that these thoughts do not come into
my head and stay there triggering depression

please pray that this latest trauma does not come between me and god
in a way a wound like this is an invitation to a deeper connection to
god and it is also a possible trigger for a spiritual crisis that can
separate one mentally from god  i know god does not drop me from his
loving hand but it is awfully easy for me to walk to the edge of the
hand look down think i am falling and forget that gods still holding
on to me

although this probably is not entirely appropriate for this newsgroup
i really can use the kind of loving support you all provide  for this
reason i hope good mr moderator allows me this latest indulgence  after
all he is allowed me the thermometer note and a few other offthewall
topics

of can tell me there are no clutch hitters maybe no stat can tell me
either but some people are i just know it eight

but why would you want to use rbi   rbi is an attempt to measure is some
combination of clutch hitting and power hitting  if you believe in
clutch hitting then look at how the guy hit with risp  if you want to
see how good of a slugger he is then look at his slugging average  

in terms of evaluating players rbi totals are better than nothing  but
why use them when so many better stats are out there

we have a setup with with thirteen polaroid transducers and rangefinders we
would like to fire these three at a time with about five ms between
firings the three that are being fired do not fire in the same
direction 

to further explain the situation assume we are firing sonars abc
five ms apart each other we should normally see an echo on a that
corresponds to the distance however sonar a detects the init line
of sonar b the detection is actually through the transducer of sonar a
we can see a very faint fiftykhz signal on the transducer exactly at the
time the init line of sonar b is activated 

we feel that there is some ground coupling that is causing this interference
we came to this conclusion since we are using a separate power supply
for sonars b and c

i started a similar thread about a month ago and got many replies
the summary

ctx fourteen nasty low quality avoid

ctx fifteen proscan not as good as some other makes however cheap
  main problem seems poor quality control some reported pincushioning
  the problem i had others poor focus etc etc

i complained about mine and it was  aretuned i dodnt even pay
shipping and returned to me in two days 

it is now clear wellfocussed and has no pincushioning or barrel
distortion at all i am very happy with it and the digital
controls and mode memory are nice certainly a trinitron
say would be much nicer but that is well out of my price range

conclusion if you are on a budget get one and be prepared to
send it back if it is not perfect it probably will not be when you get it
but has good potential

subject re centris six hundred and fifty to decstation enet adapter
organization university of toronto department of industrial engineering
lines eightysix

pnsfonedwsmucsoneumassdedu dennis j wilkinson writes
not necessarily a thridparty adapter apple does manufacture transceivers
for thinwire and tenbaset twisted pair cable media as well as an aui
attachment unit interface transciever they run at one hundred each if you use
thinwire or tenbaset you will probably also need terminators apples
transceivers are selfterminated if i remember correctly but i have no
idea about decs 

the thirdparty media adapters are usually cheaper at least in toronto than
apples i bought the adapters from asante instead of apple

gurmanumbragsfcnasagov joseph b gurman writes
    the decstation five thousand models two hundred and two hundred and forty come with thinwire only
cannot say for certain about the models one hundred and twentyfive and one hundred and thirtythree so your best bet

that is not true only the decstation five thousandtwo hundred comes with a thinwire
bnc coaxial ethernet connector the five thousandtwentyfive five thousandone hundred and thirtythree and five thousandtwo hundred and forty
all have a single fifteenpin aui ethernet connector only i distinctly
remembered this because when got the five thousandtwo hundred first and i thought all
of them are going to be thinwire i eventually had to go back and ordered
destas decs oversized version of an auitobnc adapter that must be used
with a transciever cable for the rest of the stations

my advise to the very original poster beverly is

one if all you want is to create a lan with two workstations and will not add
    machines to it ever go for thinwire regardless of the media type going
    for utp unshielded twisted pair wiring requires a concentrator which
    means extra money and i believe these units come with at least six ports
    as for thicknet it is a nightmare and cabling is expensive avoid it
    unless you have no choice eg the two machines are two floors parts

two on the mac side you will need
     one thinwire media adapter from apple or thirdparty
     macx make sure you get version onetwo oneoneseven will not run on system sevenone
     mactcp which comes with macx if you get macx vonetwo you should be
      getting mactcp voneoneone with it do not use earlier versions on a centris
     you may or may not need a twentyfiveohm terminator depending on the
      thinwire media adapter so just ask the sales if the adapter is
      selfterminated or not
     configure mactcp to use ethernet

three on the decstation side you will need
     for a model two hundred you will only need a tconnector
     for models twentyfive one hundred and twentyfive one hundred and thirtythree two hundred and forty you will need an auitobnc adapter
      get one that can be plugged in directly to the aui port of the
      decstation this way you save the cost of a transciever cable
      a fifteenpin aui male to a fifteenpin aui female cable
     get a twentyfiveohm terminator

your twomachine network will look like this

  as an economist i am sure you can see the flaws in this logic if the naive
market is flooded with proprietary but weak encryption then truly strong 
encryption will be unable to compete

this is true for the mass market but not for those who need strong crypto
and are willing to pay the price after all one can buy strong crypto today
if one is willing to spend enough

thus the concern is not economic

the issue most worth worrying about is that after the system takes hold the
government will outlaw other systems and something voluntary will become
the only system available that is a political not an economic issue

as a separate matter you may be making an implied advocacy for cheap secure
crypto for everyone it is true that the clipper chip would probably prevent
that except via clipper but cheap secure crypto for everyone is a
political discussion not an economic one and the whole point of clipper is 
to resolve that political policy tension between securing legitimate
communications and tapping the crooks

   at the company i worked for previously i received a file that was
   des encryped and the person that had sent it went on vaction
   rather than wait two weeks i set up a straight frontal attack with
   one key at a time  it only took twotwo days to crack the file
   no i do not have any faith in des
   

   taking this at face value though it seems quite dissonant with
   much else that has been published here about brute force des
   cracking unless russell was lucky with respect to the key i would be
   very interested in whether the program russell used is available

key search is very practical in many real situations since people use
such stupid keys on the average  password crackers know this well

   depending on his answer this could be an appalling development
   calling into question both des and rsades

not really  in fact public key based communication systems very
often pick keys automatically which are much better than passwords or
pass phrases

   if any bright programmer with a little idle machine time can crack
   a single des message in a couple of days assuming no tricks that
   are messagespecific

if a person picked the password or pass phrase then the key search is
pretty straightforward  in running english text the average content
of a single word is about eight bits  in pass phrases this may increase
to ten bits or so  searching thirtybit spaces is semipractical even in
software and searching fortybit spaces is not outrageous to imagine with
hardware assists of moderate size

by the way i am a walc white aryan lapsed catholic


dbaba duane m hentrich        babatymnetcom

   i would like to go on record as objecting to mr hentrich calling
himself an aryan  the word aryan is of sanskrit origin and occurs first
in the hindu scripture the rigveda  it seems to have been a tribal term
but may have had connotations of good character  such connotations
are quite explicit in the sayings of the buddha who called his religion the
eightfold aryan path   the word was borrowed by the german scholar
max mueller who used it as a synonym for indoeuropean but then the
nazis proceeded to steal it and started pretending that aryan is
synonymous with nordic which seems highly unlikely  the people who
originally called themselves aryas  the iranians noprth indians the afghans
and possibly the kurds are none of them nordic  so the use of the word
by westerners though meant with apparent good humor in this case is
nontheless inappropriate  the only westerners who may have some claim
to call themselves aryans by descent are the celts who seem to have wor
shipped a god called aryaman who is mentioned in the rigveda

  if you want to check what i am saying look at  mallorys book in
search of the indoeuropeans or just look at the encyclopedia britannica
the reason this usage is offensive is that most of ancient indian literature
as well as religion is directly or inderectly due to the aryans and
for westerners to butt in is really not nice not to mention the horrible
things done by germans to jews using a word to which the germans have
no clear claim

 syndrome  a group of us went to the restaurant and all shared six different
 dishes  it did not taste great but i decided it was not so bad  we went
 home and went to bed early  i woke up at two am and puked my guts outs
 i threw up for so long that i am not kidding i pulled a muscle in
 my tongue  dry heaves and everything  no one else got sick and i am
 not allergic to anything that i know of  
 
 suffice to say that i will not go into a chinese restaurant unless i am

 i have not gotten sick yet
 
  

i had a similar reaction to chinese food but came to a completly different
conclusion i have eaten chinese food for ages and never had problems i went
with some chinese malaysian friends to a swanky chinses rest and they ordered
lots of stuff i had never seen before the only thing i can remember of that
meal was the first course scallops served in the she will with a soytype sauce
i thought well i have only had scallops once and i was sick after but that
could have been a coincidence that night as i sat on the bathroom floor
sweating and emptying my stomach the hard way i decided i would never touch
another scallop i may not be allergic but i do not want to take the chance

the body at the proper door to start with

the final stages of denial i can hardly imagine what the result
would have been if the clinton administration had actually supported
this plan instead of merely acquiescing with repugnance as they have so
obviously doing  i do not believe the chip originated with the clinton
administration either but the clinton administration has embraced it
and brought it to fruition

both of the major parties have what they consider excellent reasons
for limiting your freedoms and violating your privacy and even seem
to feel that they are doing you a favor  if this is really surprising
to anyone it means they have been willfully ignoring quite a bit of
previous evidence  there is only one political party not calling
anarchists a party that considers your freedom and privacy goals
worthy in and of themselves  if you are voting for the big two you are
supporting a reduction of those rights given their goals and their
histories regardless of whether you personally support that
reduction  to paint clinton and gore as unwitting tools is really
stretching things

yes there could be that low sentences or high poverty could influence the
figures but they are still pretty high right
i also believe texas has some of the most liberal gunlaws in usa

texas only has liberal gun laws as far as purchasing a firearm aside 
from that it is probably more restrictive than most states as far as carry
goes


one state do not remember which texas tried to impose a rule that you could
only buy one gun each month think you all know what happened

the state was virginia and the law passed

i respect the right to defend yourself but that right should not inflict on
other people

that right only inflicts on those who threaten my rights to life

it is complete and there can be no further addition  the 
holy prophet muhammad saw closed the long line of messengers
allahs teaching is and will always be continuous but there
has been and will be no prophet after muhammad saw  the later
ages will want thinkers and revivers not prophets  this is not
an arbitrary matter  it is a decree full of knowledge and wisdom
for allah has full knowledge of all things

a treatise on the miracles of muhammed saw       

continued from droplet vol one no eleven part one

   second  sign   the  noble  messenger  saw
declared his prophethood and presented to humanity a
decree as the glorious quran and manifest miracles
which number according to the scholars one thousand
the occurrence of those miracles in their entirety is as
certain as the fact that he declared himself prophet  in
fact as a shown by the words of the  most obstinate
unbelievers quoted in various places of the wise
ouran even they could not deny the occurrence of his
miracles but only called them hasha wa kellaallah forbids 
sorcery in order to satisfy themselves or to deceive their
followers  the miracles of muhammad saw have the
certainty of confirmation by consensus of ulema scholars
of islam to the hundreth degree
   the miracle is the conformation by the creator of
the universe of his declaration of prophethood it has the
effect of the wordsyou have indeed spoken the truth 
   suppose that you said in the assembly of a ruler
while being observed by him the true ruler has
appointed me to such and such position  at a time when
you were asked to prove your claim the word yes
uttered by the ruler would sufficiently support you  or if
the ruler changed his usual practice and attitude at your
request this would confirm your claim even more soundly
and more definitely than would the word yes
   in the same way allahs most noble messenger
claimed i am the envoy of the creator of this
universe  my proof is that he will change his unbroken
order at my request and my prayer  now look at my
fingers  he makes them run like a fountain with five
spigots  look at the moon by a gesture of my finger he
splits it in two  look at that tree to affirm me and to bear
witness to me it moves and comes near to me  look at
this food although it is barely enough for two or three
men it satisfies two or three hundred  further he shows
hundreds of similar miracles  however the evidences  of
the veracity of this high being and the proofs of his
prophethood are not restricted to his miracles  all his
deeds and acts his words and behavior his moral
conduct and manners his character and appearance
prove to the attentive his truthfulness and seriousness
indeed many people  such  as  abdullah  b salam  the
famous scholar of the children of israel came to belief
merely by seeing him and said no lie can hide in this
face nor can any fraud be found in it
   although many of the  researchers have concluded
that the proofs of the prophethood of muhammad and his
miracles number about one thousand there are
thousands perhaps hundreds of thousands of proofs  of
his prophethood  and hundreds of thousands of
truthseeking men muhakkikiin with varying opinions
have affirmed his prophethood in an equal number of
ways
   the wise ouran alone demonstrates thousands of
the proofs of his prophethood in addition to its own forty
aspects of miraculousness  since prophethood is as a
phenomenon of humanity and hundreds of thousands of
individuals who claimed prophethood and performed
miracles have lived and passed away then the
prophethood of muhammad saw is of a certanity
superior to that of the prophethood of all the others  for
whatever evidences qualities  and attributes  became the
means of the prophethood and messengership of all the
messengers such as jesus as and moses as they
are all owned in a more perfect and comprehensive
fashion by muhammad saw  and since the causes and
means of prophetic authority exist more perfectly in the
person of muhammad saw this authority is to be found
in him with more certanity than all the other prophets

however if i were to design a bmws electronics i will use a counter to 
count the number of times the car passed one million miles or whatever and 
store it in the car computers memory this could be read when doing a 
diagnostics test ditto for the date of the odometer as easy as this is i 
do not know why manafucturers do not do it do not they to prevent illegal 
odometer tampering

but as a previous writer said it will in any case take aeons to reset an 
odometer mechanic or electronic by simulating a driving car it will be 
easier to reprogram it how i do not know

it should not be that hard if you know much about digital electronics  if the
counter is made with standard ttl chips all you should need to do is find
the chips used for counting figure out what mileage you want to put in
and preset it but wiring the preset pins directly to lowhigh you would also have
to know what the conventions are for low and high  it might be a little more
involved than this but it should not be beyond someone with a bsee or bs eet
all the display does is convert what the counter chips say into digits using
a translation table stored in rom

selah

dan

but those chips are probably inside a custom chip to make it smaller and
use less power and the presetdata pins are not going to be available
it would probably not be ttl but might be cmos 
wider operating voltage range not that the tecnology would make 
much difference
plus the custom chip would probably be potted encapsulated with epoxy
good luck

i am trying to help a friend of mine get the second serial port on his dtk
io plus ii card working and it does not want to cooperate the documentation
is no help at all as an example it says the serial port can be changed to
comtwo from comone by moving jumpers but does not say what jumpers to move 

there are two banks of jumpers the first one is labeled as follows
cone
ctwo
stwo
ptwo
pone
g

the second bank is labeled irq and has the following labels
fivec
fives
four
three
threes
twoc
twos

i have determined that the cone  ctwo jumpers tell it to address the first
serial port as comone or comtwo the poneptwo jumpers tell it to use the printer
port as lptone or lpttwo i am guessing that the g enables the game port and
the stwo should enable the second serial port but i cannot get it to work i
have tried numerous setting on the irq bank without success i assume that
this bank must tell the card which irqs to use for both ports but i dont
know how  any suggestions would be greatly appreciated

often indistinguishable from a poor one

the last sentence is ironic since so many readers of

josh mcdowell and cs lewis the above also expresses a rather odd sense
of history what makes you think the masses in aquinas day who were
mostly illiterate knew any more about rhetoric and logic than most people

why would apple release a duo dock with a processor of its own

here is why people have hounded apple for a notebook with a sixtyeight thousand and forty processor
in it apple cannot deliver that right now because the forty saps too much
power radiates far too much heat and is too large for a notebook how
does one get around that without designing a new chipset use existing
powerbook technology to your best advantage the duo dock gives apple a
unique ability to give users that forty power in a semiportable fashion
by plunking the forty into the dock you have got quadra power at your desk
on the road that thirtythreemhz sixtyeight thousand and thirty should be able to handle most of your needs
okay not the best solution but its an answer to a nowin situation 
so does this mean one will be able to use the powerbooks processor in
parallel to the docks processor okay we are getting really hypothetical
now 

it would also be great for another reason  when not docked it could serve
as an ara server to the large internal hd your corporate email etc  in
a pinch you would also have two machines instead of onefive

if they could couple that thought with rocketshare and let you use both the
thirty on the pb and the forty on the dock it would be a mighty powerful dock

jayne kulikauskas writes

i am uncomfortable with the tract in general because there seems to be 
an innappropriate emphasis on hell  god deserves our love and worship 
because of who he is  i do not like the idea of frightening people into 
accepting christ  

and yet jayne  as we read the gospels and in particular the topics that jesus
himself spoke on hell figures in a large  of the time certainly more than
heaven itself  paul as we learn in i thess taught new believers and new
churches eschatology and did not hesitate to teach hell and damnation  rev
chapter twentyelevenfifteen is very specific and cannot be allegorized  i think the word
throne is used fortyfive times in rev and that the unbelieving come to receive the
assignment of the severity of judgement for in john three we read that they are
already judged  rom three speaks that every mouth will be shut  there is no
recourse excuse or defense

i see evangelism as combining a way of living that shows gods love with 
putting into words and explaining that love  preaching the gospel 
without living the gospel is no better than being a noisy gong or a 
clanging cymbal

yes i agree with you  life is often like a pendulum where it swings to
extremes before stopping at moderation  i think we have seen the extreme of
the hell fire  brimstone preacher but also we have seen the other extreme
where hell not talked about at all for fear of offending someone is
sensibilities

i forget who founded the word of life ministries but i remember him telling a
story  he was in a small town hardware store and some how a man got to the
point of telling him that he did not believe in satan or hell  he believed
everybody was going to heaven  it was at this point that the man was asked to
pray to god that he would send his children to hell  of course the man
would not do it  but the point was made  many people say they do not believe in
hell but they are not willing to really place their faith in that it does not
exist  if this man had he would of prayed the prayer because hell did not
exist and there would have been no fear in having his prayer answered  and
yet they walk as if they believe they will never be sent there

i would use a different illustration however  i have to include myself in it 
when i watch say a basketball go bulls game and i see a blatant foul that
is not called oi vey  what is with that ref that he did not make that call 
it is unfair  and just so in life righteousness demands payment  as the
surgeon takes knife in hand to cut the cancer away so god cuts off that which
is still of the old creation  we must preach the gospel in all its richness
which includes the fact that if you reject the way and the truth and the life
then broad is the way to distruction


here is a question  how many of you are christians because you are 
afraid of going to hell  how many are responding to gods love

i think i would fall in there somewhere  actually it was both  after all
repentance is not only a turning towards but also a turning away from
no again if jesus used it in his ministry then i can surely see that we
should do it also  in love of course but in truth most assuredly  

i have thought about writing something on this topic but not now and here  i
would say that there are some good reasons for its existence and its
eternality

one god is light  yes he is love but his love has the boundary of holiness
two dignity of man  either a man is a robot or he is a responsible creature
   if responsible then he is also accountable
three the awfulness of sin  today we have a poor poor concept of sin  god
four christ  he was willing to die and go there himself to offer an avenue to
   the whosoever will

the scout oath specifically the promise to live morally straight

there is really nothing else to discuss  trying to cloud the issue

because it is like comparing apples to oranges ie people cannot
control their race but they can control their behavior

what else is there to possibly discuss on recscouting on this issue
nobody including bsa is denying anybody the right to live andor
worship as they please or do not please  but it does not mean that bsa
is the big bad wolf for adhering to the recognized positive religious

fitzmyer is one of the preeminent modern nt scholars  he was also one
of the early workers on the dss  his book is written in a

may fix the problem note not known to work on solaris


subject  ninetyfive  why does not my sun with sunos fourone know about dlsym etc

	if you get errors with dlsym dlopen dlclose undefined link with 
libdla  add ldl to your and eventually your sitedef  you may want to 
surround it with bstatic ldl bdynamic if you add it to the extralibraries
variable since syslibs get added after extralibraries on the eventual 
compilation command otherwise you may not have a shared libdl  or compile 
the stubs shared

subject  ninetyseven  why cannot gcc compile xelevenrfour on my sparc
i used gcc to compile the whole distribution but i get several segmentation
faults when running x

	note first that gcc on risc machines does not necessarily result in
any performance increase it certainly is not as noticeable as it is on the
six hundred and eightyxzero or vax platforms

	here is the problem gcc and cc use incompatible methods of passing 
structures as arguments and returning them as function values so when 
gcccompiled parts of x are linked with sunsupplied functions that pass or 
return structs runtime errors occur  affected programs include rgb and 
the server

	this is from the gcc manual

	on the sparc gnu cc uses an incompatible calling convention for 
	structures  it passes them by including their contents in the argument
	list whereas the standard compiler passes them effectively by 
	reference

	this really ought to be fixed but such calling conventions are not yet
	supported in gnu cc so it is not straightforward to fix it

	the convention for structure returning is also incompatible and
	fpccstructreturn does not help

you can duck the problem either by using cc throughout or by using it for just
the routines which because incompatibilities the problem cannot be solved with 
compilation flags  

	files which need to be compiled using cc include
		serverosfourtwobsdoscolorc 
		rgbrgbc

	in addition several of the inet functions use structs as args or
return values  
		clientsxhostxhostc 
		clientsxauthgethostc 
calls to inetaddr in libclxsocketc and libxxconndisc are possibly 
harmless as they do not involve structs

interest it should be identical modulo irrelevant differences like 
whitespace  if the gcc version has x where the cc version has i your 
fixincludes run did not work for some reason or other go back to your gcc
sources and run fixincludes then rebuild the x distribution if they are 
identical try running a make clean in mitserver and rebuilding just to make 
sure everything gets compiled with the proper include files

in mitserverddxsunsuncgthreecc we have found missing defines for 
cgthreeacmonolen cgthreebcmonolen cgthreeacenblen cgthreebcenblen what should these be

	the rfour errata list distributed after xelevenrfour mentions that you can add
these lines to the file on older sunos versions eg threefive to compile
        define cgthreeacmonolen one hundred and twentyeightone thousand and twentyfour
        define cgthreeacenblen  cgthreeacmonolen
        define cgthreebcmonolen cgthreeacmonolen
        define cgthreebcenblen  cgthreeacmonolen

	however the sunthree should not actually ever have the cgthree device and so 
references to it can be removed from mitserverddxsunsuninitc and the 
imakefile  elevenninety

subject one hundred and one  what are these problems using rfour shared libraries on sunos four
all of the executables that i try to run have the following results
	ldso libxmusofour not found
or even
	ldso call to undefined procedure gethostname from zeroxfseven hundred and seventysixaninetysixc

	if you are building with shared libraries on a sun remember that you 
need to run ldconfig as root after installing the shared libraries if you have
installed x on a fileserver run it on the servers clients too  while 
building and installing the distribution you need to be careful to avoid 
linking against any existing x shared libraries you might have eg those 
distributed with openwindows  you should make sure you do not have 
ldlibrarypath set in your environment during the build or the installation  
if you are going to keep xterm and xload as setuid programs please note that 
the shared libraries must be installed in usrlib usrlocallib or 
usrfivelib for these programs to work or else those programs must be linked 
statically courtesy mit x consortium
	note also that the program mkfontdir is run as part of the build it
attempts however to use the shared libraries before they have been installed
you can avoid the errors by building mkfontdir statically pass bstatic to
most c compilers


subject one hundred and two  can olit programs run with rfive xt xtqstring undefined

this is a bug in the olit  xtqstring was an external symbol that existed in 
xelevenrfour upon which ow threezeros libxt is based  it was not documented and was 
removed in xelevenrfive mits guarantee of upward compatibility between the rfour and rfive
libraries only applied to the documented interface  

a workaround is to temporarily set your ldlibrarypath to point to the xelevenrfour
or openwindows xt library that you linked the program against

subject one hundred and three  how do i get around the sunos fourone security hole

	there is a security problem with certain rfour clients xterm and xload
running under sunos fourone that have been installed setuid root and are using 
shared libraries to avoid the problem do one of these
	one make the program nonsetuid you should consult your system
administrator concerning protection of resources eg ptys and devkmem used
by these programs to make sure that you do not create additional security 
problems at your site
	two relink the programs statically using bstatic
	three install the libraries before linking and link with absolute paths
to the libraries

from rwsexpolcsmitedu bob scheifler twelveninety

the rfive version of xterm does this automatically by rebuilding xterm against the
newlyinstalled libraries when xterm is being installed this prevents an suid
program from being built with libraries specified relatively note that this 
may cause an inconvenience when doing the installation from nfsmounted disks 
xload has been rewritten to avoid the problem


subject one hundred and four  how do i get around the framebuffer security hole

	on many systems the framebuffer is unsecured by default this permits 
anyone who can log into your workstation to peek at your windowing session by 
accessing the framebuffer directly or as less of a privacy issue but perhaps
more annoying to accidentally start up a second x session on your console 
display check the man page for fbtabfive

subject one hundred and five  topic building x programs 

subject one hundred and six  what is imake

	imake is not a replacement for the make program instead it is a
makefilegenerator that takes advantages of the includefile and macro
processing capabilities of the c preprocessor cpp to generate makefiles 
suitable for building software on a particular system although it is not 
specific to x the x release uses it to help solve a number of the 
configuration issues that arise in making such a large system widely portable
	imake has a fairly steep learning curve in part because the process by
which the systemspecific configuration files systemindependent configuration
files and individual imakefiles are melded to produce a makefile is not 
obvious
	there have been several different versions of imake the rthree rfour and
rfive versions are different

	you can obtain information on imake from these sources
	 the rfour and rfive release notes and imake man page include information on
using imake to build x
	 the rfour and rfive file mitconfigreadme also contains useful information
	 on the rfour tapes contribdocimakeimaketex is mark moraes rthreerfour
guide to imake
	 the rfive mitdocconfigusenixwspaperms contains a paper by jim
fulton on an early version of imake
	 paul dubois duboisprimatewiscedu has written a useful 
explanation of how imake works and how to use it in configuring x for non

subject one hundred and seven  where can i get imake

	versions are distributed with the rfour and rfive releases an earlier 
version is distributed with the xelevenrthree release some thirdparty toolkits 
redistribute versions of imake along with their own implementations of the 
template and configuration files there are no real standards for such 
configuration files although most current contributed software expects the 
templates distributed with xelevenrfive
	export contains the rfive distribution unpacked so you can pick up imake
without picking up the entire distribution
	a standalone version of imake but one stemming from xelevenrfive is in
ftpgermanyeunetpubxelevenmiscimakeimakepuretarz one hundred and ninetytwoseventysixone hundred and fortyfourseventyfive


subject one hundred and eight  i have a program with an imakefile but no makefile what to do

	if you have rfour or rfive installed on your system run xmkmf this is a 
script which runs imake for you with the correct arguments the output is a 
makefile configured for your system and based on the imakefile then run make 
which will use that new makefile to compile the program


subject one hundred and nine  why cannot i link to the xlib shape routines
when i try to compile certain programs i get the following link error
	undefined
	xshapequeryextension
	xshapecombinemask

	these routines are actually part of the shape extension to x shape
which was introduced in the mit xelevenrfour distribution and allows nonrectangular
windows  like the other sample server extensions the shape extension will 
only run on a server which supports it  prexelevenrfour servers as well as many 
vendorsupplied servers do not support the shape extension in which case 
they will display rectangular windows anyway

	in order to use the shape extension you must link to the library 
libxexta  in the xelevenrfour distribution this library and the associated includes
will be in the mitextensions directory  if you do not have these files do 
not despair  many freeware programs which use the shape extension can also be 
compiled without it by removing the dshape define from the makefile you can
probably do this and compile successfully against your older vendorsupplied x 
libraries

subject one hundred and ten  what are these problems with xtinherit not found on the sun
when i run a x program that i wrote on a sunos fourzerothree or fourone machine i get the 
error ldso symbol not found xtinherit

	what you are seeing is a sideeffect of a kludge in the rfour libxta to 
get sun shared libraries working  apparently you cannot share a function that 
is both called and compared as xtinherit is this was handled by putting 
xtinherit in the same file as a function that is always used thereby 
guaranteeing that it would be loaded  that is in initializec where 
xttoolkitinitialize and xtinitialize reside these routines would normally
be called

	you are probably seeing this error because your program is not a normal
xtbased program and does not call xttoolkitinitialize anywhere 
	one it may be a program that uses xt functions but never opens a 
connection to the x server  osfmotifs oneonezero uil had this problem it called
xtmalloc and other xt functions the solution is to add the call to your 
program the function does not have to be executed just linked in
	two alternatively your program does not need any xt functions and is
correct in not calling xttoolkitinitialize  it may be an xlib or xview 
program in this case you can remove lxt from your link command 

	it should not be necessary to link the shared libraries statically
although this will certainly solve the problem

subject one hundred and twelve  topic programming problems and puzzles

subject one hundred and thirteen  why does not my program get the keystrokes i select for sic

	the window manager controls how the input focus is transferred from one
window to another  in order to get keystrokes your program must ask the
window manager for the input focus  to do this you must set up what are
called hints for the window manager  if your applications is xlibbased you
can use something like the following

        xwmhints wmhints
        
        wmhintsflags  inputhint
        wmhintsinput  true
        xsetwmhintsdpy window wmhints

if your application is based on the xt intrinsics you can set the xtninput 
resource to be true as you probably want to in any case if you do not have
source you can start up the application with the resource inputtrue

certain window managers notably dxwm and olwm are very picky about having 
this done 

	if you are using suns openwindows olwm you can also add this resource
to your defaults file to use clients that are not icccmcompliant
	openwindowsfocuslenience       true

mostly courtesy dave lemke of ncd and stuart marks of sun


subject one hundred and fourteen  how do i figure out what window manager is running

	you cannot reliably tell whatever mechanism you could use could be
spoofed in any case 
	for most cases you should not care which window manager is running so 
long as you do things in an icccmconformant manner there are some cases in 
which particular window managers are known to do things wrong checking for
particular hints placed on the window by the window manager so that you can 
sidestep the problem may be appropriate in these cases alternatively it may 
be appropriate to determine which window manager is running in order to take
advantage of specific added features such as olwms pushpin menus in order
to give your program added functionality beware of usurping the window 
managers functions by providing that functionality even when it is missing
this surely leads to future compatibility problems


subject one hundred and fifteen  is there a skeleton x program available
	
	there is no general framework such as the transskel program for the 
macintosh which handles lots of the odds and ends and overhead of development 
under a window system and which can be used as a platform for additional 
development in x the problem is typically solved by using an interactive 
application builder tool or by using cutpaste on existing x applications good
applications which you might look to manipulate when you want to test just 
this one little thing include contribclientsxskel a simple rfour program that 
puts up a window and allows sketching in it and offers a starting point for
quick hacks the xaw examples in the examples directory in the rthree and rfour 
distributions and the xlib hello world example in the rthree dochelloworld and 
rfour doctutorialshelloworld an updated version of this program which uses rfour 
xlib calls and current icccm conventions was posted in twoninety to compwindowsx  
by glenn widener of tektronix 	threeninety

	in addition a sample xt program for xaw or xm by rainer klute 
showing how to open multiple displays and how to catch a broken display 
connection is available on exportlcsmitedu in contribmdisptarz fourninetytwo


subject one hundred and sixteen  why does xtgetvalues not work for me sic

	the xtgetvalues interface for retrieving resources from a widget is
sensitive to the type of variable your code may be doing something like this
	
	arg argsthree
	int i
	int sensitive		 oops wrong data type 
	izero
	xtsetarg argsi xtnsensitive sensitive i
	xtgetvalueswidget args i 
	
	

but xtnsensitive is a boolean which on most machines is a single byte 
declaring the variable sensitive as boolean works properly this problem 
comes up often when using particular toolkits that redefine the xt types 
dimension and position code that assumes they are int will have similar 
problems if those types are actually short in general you are safe if you
use the actual type of the resource as it appears in the widgets man page
elevenninety


subject one hundred and seventeen  why do not xtconfigurewidgetxtresizewidgetxtmovewidget work

	you are probably trying to use these functions from application code
they should be used only internally to widgets these functions are for a 
parent widget to change the geometry of its children other promising 
functions xtmakegeometryrequest and xtmakeresizerequest are also for use 
only by widgets in this case by a child to request a change from its parent
	the only way for your application to request a geometry change for a
widget is to issue an xtsetvalues call setting some of the geometry resources
although this will result in the widgetinternal functions being called your
application code must use the standard xtsetvalues interface or risk the 
widgets data becoming corrupted
	the xlib calls xmovewindow and xresizewindow should similarly be 
avoided they should not be used to change xtnx xtny xtnwidth or xtnheight


subject one hundred and eighteen  why is not there an xtreparentwidget call like xreparentwindow

	although there are various details of the current implementation of
the xt internals which make reparenting difficult the major reason that no
such call exists is that it remains undefined what the set of resources for
the new widget should be resources are typically set based on the location
in the instance hierarchy what resources should change if the instance moves
what should happen to the widgets children and by the time such semantics are
defined there would probably be little advantage over destroying the old 
widget and creating a new widget in the correct location with the desired 
resources as setting the resources correctly is the majority of work in 
creating a new widget

	note that reparenting is possible in the oi toolkit

the media is beating the incident at dodger stadium on wednesday to
death but i have not seen anything in rsb yet

gerald perry of the cardinals pinch hit in the eighth inning with two
on and his club down by a run  he stroked a line drive into the
right field corner  the ball cleared the threefoot high fence and
went into the crowd  darryl racing over from right center got to
the spot in time to reach his glove up over the short fence but he
missed the ball  a fan sitting in the front row wearing a mitt
reached up and caught the ball  home run

now i have seen the replay several times and i have concluded that
darryl missed the ball and that the fans glove was essentially
behind darryls  several dodger fans with seats in the immediate
vicinity have claimed that the fan unquestionably interfered with
strawberry  what cannot be disputed however is that the fan
who caught the ball never took his eye off it  he was oblivious
to where the fielder was playing  he was also quite exuberant as
soon as he realized he had made the catch

that exuberance disappeared immediately however when strawberry
went into a tirade at the man  all reports indicate he used a lot
of profanity and accused the man of interference and therefore of
costing the dodgers a game  shortly afterwards other fans hurled
food and beverages toward the man who made the catch  dodger stadium
officials started to remove him from the park but then relented and
just relocated him to another area  in an interview after the game
lasorda blamed the fan for the loss  strawberry also went into a
tirade about how the fans are stupid and they do not care about 
winning  la times columnists similarly blasted the man who made
the catch

before each dodger game the public address announcer makes a speech
wherein he says that fans are welcome to the souvenirs of balls that
are hit into the stands as long as they do not interfere with any 
that are in the field of play  was the fan wrong  should he have
been more aware of the situation and acted to avoid any possibility
of interference  or was he human and just reacting  by the way he
is a season ticket holder and on his request the dodgers have relocated
his seats to another area of the stadium where future interference is
impossible

others have questioned why darryl should be so concerned with what
the fan did when he has a grand total of one rbi through the first
nine games

i question what he was doing in right center with a lefthanded pull
hitter up and the game on the line  had he been closer to the play
he certainly would have had a much better chance of catching the ball

but i guess the big debate continues as to what are the responsibilities
of the fan

in article one thousand nine hundred and ninetythreemarthirtyone hundred and eightyone thousand six hundred and thirtysixtwentytwo thousand seven hundred and fiftysixpmafireinelgov 
cdmpmafireinelgov dale cook said

 a real world data point a person has a much stronger legal claim for
 harrassment sexual or otherwise if they make it clear to the
 offender that their behaviour is unwanted  if the behaviour persists
 harrassment is much easier to demonstrate due to the fact that the
 offender knew that the behaviour was unwanted

no argument here my original query regarded the question of why the
first sexual proposition made by person a to person b would be
considered to be sexual harassment by somemany people  assuming of
course that there does not exist a power relationship between a and b
such that the proposition carries strong implications of extortion right
from word one

i can only say that those people are wrong the word harass means to 
irritate or torment persistently i would hardly consider one time to fall
under the definition of persistent  additionally there is no basis
to assume the behaviour is unwanted unlike an illegal proposition

 of course i think the original question of offering money for sex is
 inarguably harrassment because the activity is illegal and could be
 presumed to be unwanted by the average citizen

i have to take issue with this viewpoint given that a prostitution
is a victimless crime and b there are literally millions of americans
who participate in some sort of victimless activities which the state
has defined to be criminal eg prostitution obscenity gambling
using certain recreational drugs having nonmercenary sex with persons
not ones spouse in certain states having unnatural sex with people
regardless of marital status or exchange of money in certain states
etc i would have to say that the idea that an activity may be presumed to
be unwanted by the average citizen merely because it is illegal is the
sort of sophistry that only a judge could indulge in with a straight
face  he said speaking as a law student who is read his share of
judicial opinions in which reality was not only denied but in fact
actually inverted in order to make the universe conform to the writers
politics

i was speaking from a legalistic viewpoint  what you say is true but
the law in order to make what little sense it manages to make has to
make some assumptions  assuming that an illegal activity is unwanted
by the average citizen i think is reasonable  certainly i would need
a preponderance of evidence on the side of the propositioner that there
was a reasonable belief that the proposition was welcome

the number of people who participate in victimless crimes notwithstanding
the fact reamins that under the law the activity is illegal  to presume
that the proposition is welcome simply because a large number of people
indulge in it is the type of sophistry only a lawyer could indulge in
with a straight face

one is israels occupation of southern lebanon temporary

	israel has repeatedly stated that it will leave lebanon when
the lebanese government can provide guarantees that israel will not be
attacked from lebanese soil and when the syrians leave

not acceptable syria and lebanon have a right to determine if
they wish to return to the situation prior to the french invasion
where they were both part of the same mandate territory  read
colony

	and lebanon has a right to make this decision without syrian
troops controlling the country  until syria leaves and free
elections take place its is rediculous to claim that the lebanese
would even be involved in determining what happens to their country

israel has no right to determine what happens in lebanon invading another
country because you consider them a threat is precisely the way that almost
all wars of aggression have started

	i expect you will agree that the same holds true for syria
having no right to be in lebanon

	israel has already annexed areas taken over in the one thousand nine hundred and sixtyseven war
these areas are not occupied but disputed since there is no
legitamate governing body  citizenship was given to those residents
in annexed areas who wanted citizenship

the un defines them as occupied they are recognised as such by every
nation on earth excluding one small caribean island

	the un also thought zionism is racism  that fails to make it true

	the first reason was security  a large jewish presense makes
it difficult for terrorists to infiltrate  a jewish settlements also
act as fortresses in times of war

theyu also are a liability we are talking about civilian encampments that
would last no more than hours against tanks

	they lasted weeks against tanks in fortyeight and stopped those
tanks from advancing  they also lasted days in seventythree  there is little
evidence for the claim that they are military liabilities

	they evidence is there to show that when infiltrations take
place over the jordan river the existance of large patrolled
kibutzim forces terrorists into a very small area where they are
usually picked up in the morning

	a second reason was political  creating settlements brought
the arabs to the negotiation table  had the creation of new towns and
cities gone on another several years there would be no place left in
israel where there was an arab majority  there would have been no
land left that could be called arab

do not fool yourself it was the gulf war that brought the israelis to the
negotiating table once their us backers had a secure base in the gulf
they insrtructed shamir to negotiate or else

	nonsense  israel has been trying to get its neighbors to the
negotiating table for forty years  it was the gulf war that brought the
arabs to the table not the israelis

	the point is there are many reasons people moved over the
green line and many reasons the government wanted them to  whatever
status is negotiated for disputed territories it will not be an all
or nothing deal  new boundaries will be drawn up by negotiation not
be the results of a war

unless the new boundaries drawn up are those of fortyeight there will be no peace
araffat has precious little authority to agree to anything else

	nonsense  according to arafat israel must be destroyed  he
has never come clean and denied that this is his plan  he always
waffles on what he means

	when the arabs set off their volcano there will only be arabs in
	this part of the world  our people will continue to fuel the torch
	of the revolution with rivers of blood until the whole of the
	occupied homeland is liberated

to natural therapies isbn zerofourteeneight thousand five hundred and sixtyonezero new york viking penguin one thousand nine hundred and eightysix
ptwo hundred and eleven pone hundred and eightyeight  a notoverly critical but still useful overview of thirtytwo
alternative health therapies

  the russian engineer semyon kirlian and his wife valentina during the
  one thousand nine hundred and fiftys  using alternating currents of high frequency to illuminate
  their subjects they photographed them  they found that if an object
  was a good conductor such as a metal the picture showed only its
  surface while the pictures of poor conductors showed the inner
  structure of the object even if it were optically opaque  they found
  too that these high frequency pictures could distinguish between dead
  and living objects  dead ones had a constant outline whilst living ones
  were subject to changes  the objects life activity was also visible in
  highly variable colour patterns

  high frequency photography has now been practised for twenty years in
  the soviet union but only a few people in the west have taken it up
  seriously  professor douglas dean in new york and professor philips at
  washington university in st louis have produced kirlian photographs and
  others have been produced in brazil austria and germany

  using kirlian photography it is possible to show an aura around peoples
  fingers notably around those of healers who are concentrating on
  healing someone  normally blue and white rays emanate from the fingers
  but when a subject becomes angry or excited the aura turns red and
  spotty  the soviets are now using kirlian photography to diagnose
  diseases which cannot be diagnosed by any other method  they argue that
  in most illnesses there is a preclinical stage during which the person
  is not actually ill but is about to be  they claim to be able to
  foretell a disease by photographing its preclinical phase

  but the most exciting phenomenon illustrated by kirlian photography is
  the phantom effect  during high frequency photography of a leaf from
  which a part had been cut the photograph gave a complete picture of the
  leaf with the removed part showing up faintly  this is extremely
  important because it backs up the experiences of psychics who can see
  the legs of amputees as if they were still there  the important thing
  about the kirlian phantoms though is that the electromagnetic pattern
  cannot possibly represent a secondary phenomenon  or the field would
  vanish when the piece of leaf or leg vanished  the energy grid
  contained in a living object must therefore be far more significant than
  the actual object itself

  has a much richer energy field around it than ordinary water

  study making grand discoveries in his basement  many paranormal
  movements can be traced back to such people  kirlian photography for
  instance  if you pump highvoltage electricity into anything it will
  emit glowing sparks common knowledge to electrical workers and
  hobbyists for a century  it took a lone basement crank to declare that
  the sparks represent some sort of spiritual aura  in fact kirlian
  photography was subjected to rigorous testing by physicists john o
  pehek harry j kyler and david l faust who reported their findings
  in the october fifteen one thousand nine hundred and seventysix issue of science  their conclusion the
  variations observed in kirlian photographs are due solely to moisture on
  the surface of the body and not to mysterious auras or even
  necessarily to changes in mood or mental state  nevertheless
  television shows magazines and books many by famous
  parapsychologists continue to promote kirlian photography as proof of
  the unknown

in article  lmvecwestminsteracuk william hargreaves writes

	   i am a commited christian that is battling with a problem  i know
that romans talks about how we are saved by our faith not our deeds yet
hebrews and james say that faith without deeds is useless saying you fools
do you still think that just believing is enough

actually i do not think there is any conflict if we really understand
what these passages say  first what is faith  if you study the 
meaning of the greek and hebrew words so translated i think you will
come to the conclusion that the word means a lot more than mere 
belief  faith means both trust and action  if you do not put your 
belief into action it simply cannot qualify as faith  i think this 
is what james means when he says that faith without works is dead 
and i will show you my faith by my works  remember james was 
writing to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad  this 
probably means he was writing to those who would hear the gospel much 
later and would not understand the meaning of the original greek
indeed i suspect james was writing to us today among others he
intended to reach  paul on the other hand wrote mostly to the
people of the roman empire who generally understood the meaning of
the greek

another key to why there is no conflict is to look at pauls
statements in their context  i think you will find that when paul
contrasts faith and works it is in the context of comparing the
gospel with the law meaning the law of moses  this was the great
burden of pauls life  as the apostle to the gentiles he would go
convert a bunch of people then the judizers would come along and
try to convince them that they also had to obey the law of moses cf
acts chapter fifteen  in this context paul condemns the idea of being
saved by the works of the law saying that we are saved by the blood
of jesus and our faith in him  i believe that a better translation
for today would be that we are saved by faithfulness  i think
faithfulness today has a meaning closer to what the original
writers intended

now if someone is fully believing but there life is totally lead by themselves
and not by god according to romans that person is still saved by there faith

i think you misunderstand romans  what paul is really saying is
that god prefers a faithful gentile who does not keep kosher to a
kosher jew who fails to stay faithful in the more important matters
of following the lord and having charity toward his fellows

but then there is the bit which says that god preferes someone who is cold to
him ie does not know him  condemned so a lukewarm christian someone who
knows and believes in god but does not make any attempt to live by the bible

in the sense of faith described above you cannot have real faith and 
be lukewarm  if you know god but are lukewarm unfaithful you are 
worse off than the person who never heard of him  remember jesus in
the parable of the pearl of great price mat thirteenfortyfivefortysix and again in
the one on the treasure hidden in the field mat thirteenfortyfour indicates that
the price of the kingdom of god is all we have

i agree with you in general including the fact that pistis has
some of the force of faithful  however if you take that too far
you can end up with something that paul definitely would not have
intended  being faithful means following god in all things  to say
that we are saved by being faithful is very close to saying that we
are saved by commiting no sins  i assume that is not what you meant

i have almost given up on finding a specific verbal formula that
completely captures this  however i think paul is describing what i would
call a basic orientation including aspects such as trust and
commitment  jesus speaks of it as rebirth which implies a basic
change  we may still do things that are sinful and may fail to show
the new life in christ in many situations where we should  but in any
christian there had better be the basic change in orientation that
jesus calls being born again

ninefortyfive am edt

	     	  
	     q	  why was the tenzero am postponed 
	     	  
	     ms myers  just due to scheduling conflicts  so as we 
put out the president will meet with the leaders of the national 
police organizations at twozero pm in the rose garden as opposed to 
tenzero am  the only other things on his schedule today are  at 
elevenzero am he will meet with general vessey who as you know is on 
his way to vietnam to continue working on the miapow issue  at 
twelvethirty pm he will have lunch with the vice president in the oval 
office  and at twozero pm he will meet with the police organizations
then from threezero pm to fourzero pm he will do his weekly photos with the 
various groups
	     
	     q	  a photo op with vessey
	     
	     ms myers  there is no coverage on the vessey meeting
	     
	     q	  why
	     
	     ms myers  why  it is a closed meeting  
	     
	     q	  what about the lunch
	     
	     ms myers  the lunch  no there is no coverage
	     
	     q	  is he meeting with any congress people today
	     
	     ms myers  nothing scheduled
	     
	     q	  there are no meetings 
	     
	     ms myers  there are no congressional meetings today 
no
	     
	     q	  has the president been given any information by the 
pentagon or reached any conclusion about the validity of this report 
from hanoi  any instructions to vessey on how to deal with the 
vietnamese on that subject
	     
	     ms myers  well clearly the report is the first order 
of business  it is high on the agenda on something that they will 
discuss  i think the president and general vessey will discuss the 
parameters of his visit to vietnam today but the president has not 
drawn any conclusions about the report yet  certainly it is 
something that he wants general vessey to talk with the vietnamese 
about first
	     
	     q	  did the president talk with any republican senators 
yesterday about the stimulus package
	     
	     ms myers  he spoke with senator dole
	     
	     q	  how many times
	     
	     ms myers  i believe once during the day and once last 
night
	     
	     q	  what was the outcome of that
	     
	     ms myers  they are continuing to work toward some kind 
of an agreement on a jobs package
	     
	     q	  is it your impression that senator dole is in any 
way flexible on this
	     
	     ms myers  well i think we are hopeful that we are going 
to get some kind of jobs package through the senate and we will 
continue to work with senator dole and others until we reach some 
kind of an agreement
	     
	     q	  did they discuss the vat tax
	     
	     ms myers  i do not know if that came up
	     
	     q	  can you check that
	     
	     ms myers  sure

	     q	  so what are they  is the president offering to 
scale down his program  is that what he is trying to do buy it down 
to where dole will sign on
	     
	     ms myers  well he is trying to protect as much of it 
as he can  but it is important to him to get some kind of a jobs 
package through the senate and through congress now  and as soon as 
we reach some conclusions on that we will let you know  but at the 
moment he is continuing to consult with members of congress 
including obviously senator dole
	     
	     q	  is he talking to anybody else
	     
	     ms myers  i do not believe he talked to any other 
republicans yesterday
	     
	     q	  is he talking to anybody today
	     
	     ms myers  i do not think anything is scheduled but i 
would not rule it out
	     
	     q	  we were led to believe that the president called 
mr dole on the subject of russian aid and that bob dole brought the 
conversation around to stimulus package  is that correct
	     
	     ms myers  i think the president has contacted several 
people on russian aid  i think that it was always expected that the 
stimulus package or the jobs package will be part of any conversation 
he would have with senator dole  the primary objective of the 
conversation was russian aid  that was the first order of business 
but it was both
	     
	     q	  in the presidents mind are they linked 
politically in that if the republicans continue to reject the 
stimulus package he thinks it will be harder to sell russian aid to 
the american people  has he made that argument
	     
	     ms myers  i cannot talk about specifically what 
arguments he might have made  the president is obviously committed 
to both  he liked to see a jobs package to the american people 
first  but as you know we outlined the details of additional 
russian aid last night in tokyo
	     
	     q	  but does the president believe that the stimulus 
package will make it more difficult to persuade americans to vote for 
russian  to accept a vote for russian aid
	     
	     ms myers  i think that the president is going to 
continue to work to pass the stimulus package to pass a jobs 
package and we are still hopeful that we will get some kind of jobs 
package through the congress
	     
	     q	  is it fair to say that the president is negotiating 
now with dole
	     
	     ms myers  he is discussing options with him
	     
	     q	  on the stimulus is it your understanding that over 
the break some democrats themselves have left the support that they 
had earlier for the package the stimulus package
	     
	     ms myers  i think we still have wide support in the 
senate for the jobs package
	     
	     q	  but specifically that you have lost democrats other 
than shelby
	     
	     ms myers  i do not believe so  there has not been a 
vote
	     
	     q	  what about kohl
	     
	     q	  kohl and feingold
	     
	     ms myers  there has not been a vote yet  and we will 
continue to work with senators to try to get a majority to try to 
bring the package to a vote because we believe that a majority of 
the members of the united states senate support the package
	     
	     q	  if you are were not worried about kohl and feingold 
why did george mention milwaukee projects the other day
	     
	     ms myers  i think george pointed out a number of 
projects in a number of states that stand to be funded or to lose 
funding if this jobs package does not pass
	     
	     q	  no democrats  laughter
	     
	     ms myers  i will let you draw your own conclusions
	     
	     q	  does he plan to talk to dole again today or any 
other republicans again today
	     
	     ms myers  there is nothing specifically scheduled but 
again i would not rule it out
	     
	     q	  does he plan to put out any more press releases to 
any other states today
	     
	     ms myers  what we have done is we are in the process of 
breaking down the benefits of the jobs package state by state  i 
think it is entirely feasible that as we sort of are able to sum those 
up we will send out press releases to the various states that suggest 
how their states would benefit from this package
	     
	     q	  will you share those with us
	     
	     ms myers  sure  as we did yesterday
	     
	     q	  do you have copies of the ones you sent 
	     
	     ms myers  yes we made those available yesterday  and 
we certainly can continue to provide them today
	     
	     q	  dee dee since yesterdays questions and subsequent 
stories about the vat what further consideration of this issue has 
been given
	     
	     ms myers  nothings changed since yesterday  i think 
the president commented on it this morning to say only that it was 
something he knew was being considered by the task force and that he 
has not made a decision on and i do not think we have anything to add 
to that
	     
	     q	  but he also said that business and labor groups are 
telling him they support it  can you tell us 
	     
	     ms myers  i think that there has been  i am not going 
to speculate on who supports it  i think the president said that 
there has been some support among business and labor groups  i do not 
think he said he was directly contacted by them
	     
	     q	  are we to take that to mean that the administration 
has sounded out business and labor groups on this 
	     
	     ms myers  i think there is been plenty of public 
discourse on this over the years and even recently but i do not think 
i want to add to that
	     
	     q	  in february though the president said that this 
was something to be considered ten or fifteen years down the road  what 
has happened between then and now to cause this administration to 
change its mind
	     
	     ms myers  i think as we said yesterday it is 
something that the working groups are looking at  they are 
considering a wide variety of options on everything from funding to 
specific options that will be covered by the presidents health care 
plan  the president has not taken it up yet has not made a decision 
on it  and beyond that i do not have anything to add
	     
	     q	  you have not answered the question  it was not being 
considered by anyone in the white house after the presidents 
comments in february and george reaffirmed that in a briefing
	     
	     q	  and then suddenly 
	     
	     q	  what happened

	     ms myers  the working groups as we have said 
throughout we instructed to consider a wide variety of options 
acrosstheboard  and one of the things that has been talked about 
and that they are clearly considering is some kind of a valueadded 
tax

	     q	  but the president himself took this off the table 
dee dee and suddenly it reappears  and this goes to the credibility 
of this administration in a way  what has happened in the meantime

	     ms myers  the president has not looked at this it 
has not been presented to him again yet  the working groups are 
looking at it as they are looking at a wide variety of options and 
no decisions have been made

	     q	  and it raises the question of how independently the 
task force is working

	     ms myers  the task force was instructed to consider 
all options and they have taken that mandate seriously and they are 
considering all options

	     q	  but that is not the impression that the president 
left in february  the impression he left was that this was something 
that was longrange to be looked at ten fifteen years down the road  the 
clear implication of his remarks was that this was something that was 
not on the table not an option 

	     q	  if it changes i will tell you
	     
	     q	  bring him on

	     q	  and you repeatedly referred to the presidents 
remarks telling us that those were still in operation
	     
	     ms myers  it is changed and we told you  laughter
	     
	     q	  but that is what alice rivlins comments and donna 
shalala comments were about  i mean that seemed like an 
orchestrated effort because you have two independent cabinet officers 


	     ms myers  i would not  no alice rivlins not a 
cabinet member first of all  second of all it was not 
orchestrated but clearly they both said yesterday and in the last 
couple of days that it is something that is being looked at  we 
confirmed that yesterday  and i do not have anything to add to that

	     q	  is it because he has very few options

	     q	  is this something that it will be incumbent upon 
the task force to convince the president about  in other words has 
the president himself personally ruled it out and it is now up to the 
task force to convince him to put it back on the table  or is it in 
fact back on the table having been placed there by discussions with 
the president  

	     ms myers  it is not the working groups mission at 
this point to convince the president of anything  it is their 
mission to put before him his options and to explain the benefits and 
the costs and the basic pros and cons of each of those options  i 
think that they will certainly present the vat to him in that 
context and at this point he is not  that presentation has not been 
made but it is something that he will hear and he has not made a 
decision on

	     q	  they will present it to him as one of his options 
though he specifically ruled it out

	     ms myers  correct

	     q	  dee dee is this more than a trial balloon  is 
this a serious consideration that the working groups are giving to 
this form of taxation

	     ms myers  it is simply a statement of fact  the 
working groups are considering a wide variety of options on a number 
of issues relating to health care reform  one of the options that 
they are looking at is the vat 

	     q	  dee dee when the working groups were examining 
this possibility was this on the table during the same time period 
that you were telling us that it was not

	     ms myers  i do not know what the specific timing of 
their drafting of options is  i do not know

	     q	  who was telling you that it was not under 
consideration

	     ms myers  i was referring back to the presidents 
comments

	     q	  have they discovered that the sin taxes will not raise 
enough money to fund the core benefit package

	     ms myers  no there is no decisions that have been made 
on how to pay for the health care plan
	     
	     q	  i am asking whether the projections 
	     
	     ms myers  there is a number of options depending on how 
the plan is structured  you cannot decide how much the plan is going 
to cost until you decide what the plan is going to look like  and so 
you cannot discuss what financing options have been ruled in our out 
until you know

	     q	  dee dee we have been told that they have a computer 
models on a number of possible packages

	     ms myers  correct  

	     q	  the question is whether they have now determined 
whether sin taxes would not produce enough money for even the barest 
minimum package  that is not a very difficult computation

	     ms myers  it is a question that you know that we are 
not going to answer until  there is a number of options being 
considered  it depends on how the package is structured  the exact 
details of the package and the financing mechanisms used to pay for 
them are all among the decisions that have yet to be made  
	     
	     q	  and when the president has been meeting with health 
care  his health care advisors which we are told he has been doing 

	     
	     ms myers  correct
	     
	     q	     they have never once said to him these are your 
funding options including the vat  he has never heard the word vat 
in his 
	     
	     ms myers    i am not going to comment on the specific 
nature of the daily  they are not daily but the quasiregular 
briefings
	     
	     q	  well you have
	     
	     ms myers  i have not other than to say that he is not 
considered the vat  and i think that is a true statement
	     
	     q	  no but you said that it has not been presented to 
him as an option
	     
	     ms myers  correct
	     
	     q	  that does not mean he has not heard about it
	     
	     ms myers  i am not going to get into the details of 
what is discussed  i think that statement stands for itself
	     
	     q	     specific dee dee  when you say he has not 
looked at it do you mean that he has not looked at it in terms of 
paying for medical coverage or has not looked at it in general  
because back in chilicothe he was very specific in defining how it 
works what the advantages are the whole thing  it sounds like 
	     
	     ms myers  but that was  i think in chilicothe if 
you go back to his remarks there it was a broader philosophical 
discussion of the tax structure  and i think the comments were 
generally in reference to the overall economic plan  but clearly 
it is something that he is thought about in the broad context  i mean 
that was clear in chilicothe  what i am saying is that in the process 
of the working groups it is something that he has not considered yet  
it is something that the working groups will present to him among the 
number of options and that no decisions have been made  and i am not 
going to comment any further on the details of the meetings where 
health care issues are being discussed
	     
	     q	  it is your statement from this podium that no 
discussion of this has taken place  you say that no option  that 
the option has not been presented to him
	     
	     ms myers  that is correct
	     
	     q	  do you stand by  does the white house still stand 
by georges statement in march that this will not be in the proposal
	     
	     ms myers  no decisions have been made  we have 
nothing to add to what is already been said
	     
	     q	  let me follow up here  do you stand by what rivlin 
said yesterday that if any kind of vat were to be used or 
considered that other changes to the tax code would have to be made 
so that it would be less regressive
	     
	     ms myers  i am not going to comment any further on what 
might happen if
	     
	     q	  but do you stand by the previous conversations in 
february that if there were to be a vat i think the president said 
you would exclude food and energy 
	     
	     ms myers  i am not going to comment on the specific 
structure of a decision that has not been made
	     
	     q	  was the president aware prior to donna shalalas 
comments yesterday that this was under consideration by the working 
groups
	     
	     ms myers  i do not know specifically what 
	     
	     q	  could you check for us because that is a real 
important credibility question
	     
	     ms myers  sure
	     
	     q	  since the task force was brought together this 
issue has been discussed at the beginning and throughout as one 
fairly painless way to raise a lot of money  were you all kept in 
the dark  was the press office kept in the dark over the past month 
and a half when you have been denying that a vat tax would be 
considered that it was actually on the table over there as an option
	     
	     ms myers  i think we have said all that we have to say  
it is something the working groups are looking at  the president has 
not made a decision about it yet  and beyond that i have nothing to 
add
	     
	     q	  well sorry dee dee there are still a couple of 
questions that we are going to have to ask because we have a problem 
with credibility here  yours primarily  what we are asking is if 
you all were not told at all that this thing was being considered 
while you were coming out here and telling us that it was not or if 
it is a case that you were coming out here and deliberately misleading 
us
	     
	     ms myers  i do not believe that anyone has ever come 
out here and deliberately misled you from this podium  ever ever
	     
	     q	  has anyone tried to shade it a little bit to 
indicate something  has anybody told anybody to come out 
	     
	     ms myers  we are not trying to shade answers or 
deliberately mislead anybody  i have said what i have to say about 
this issue
	     
	     q	  all we were trying to find out 
	     
	     ms myers  i understand what you are trying to find out 
and i have given you the answers helen
	     
	     q	  we are trying to find out what changed  what made 
it an option again  that is the 
	     
	     ms myers  the working groups were given a broad 
mandate to investigate all options and they are doing that  
	     
	     q	  yes but it was not an option before  how can you 
investigate it if the president has taken it off the table
	     
	     ms myers  it is something that they are obviously 
considering and the president has not made a decision on
	     
	     q	  yes but he took it off the table in february
	     
	     ms myers  working groups are considering it  they will 
present it to the president at some point and he will make a decision
	     
	     q	  why would they consider it if he has taken it off 
the table
	     
	     ms myers  it is clearly on the table 
	     
	     q	  yes but he took it off the table  did he change 
his mind
	     
	     ms myers  it is back on the table bill
	     
	     q	  did he change his mind
	     
	     ms myers  he said this morning that he has not made a 
decision about it  he obviously knows that it is on the table  it is 
something that he will look at at some and when we have a decision on 
this we will let you know
	     
	     q	  so he must have changed his mind right
	     
	     ms myers  at some point it will be looked at  i mean 

	     
	     q	  dee dee there is like two options  either he 
changed his mind or the working groups think they are authority 
exceeds the presidents
	     
	     ms myers  the working groups were given a broad 
mandate to look at all options they have done that
	     
	     q	  are you going to put out his income tax
	     
	     ms myers  yes there will be something available on 
his income tax probably later this afternoon  his return will be 
available 
	     
	     q	  will there be any kind of briefing to go through 
it
	     
	     ms myers  no nothings planned  i think someone will 
be available probably not in a briefing setting but to walk you 
through the questions
	     
	     q	  we are used to be walked linebyline through the 
presidential tax forms
	     
	     ms myers  i have seen those briefings  laughter
	     
	     q	  could we have one
	     
	     ms myers   no i do not think there will be any kind of 
a formal briefing but there will be somebody available to answer 
your questions about it
	     
	     q	  did they file a joint form
	     
	     ms myers  yes
	     
	     q	  when did he file it
	     
	     ms myers  i believe it is being filed today
	     
	     q	  dee dee is there going to be a backgrounder for 
miyazawa
	     
	     ms myers  no there will be a readout after the 
meeting
	     
	     q	  no backgrounder today
	     
	     ms myers  no backgrounder today
	     
	     q	  this is complicated stuff  we need help  
laughter
	     
	     ms myers  we cannot give you taxes and miyazawa all in 
one day it is too confusing  laughter
	     
	     q	  vance and owen have opened the doors on the use of 
force in bosnia   they have both said that a they never ruled it 
out and b it might be necessary now  does that influence your 
thinking on whether or not to change your approach
	     
	     ms myers  there is been no change in our policy towards 
bosnia  we have always said that we would consider 
	     
	     q	  but does that impact upon your decision  are they 
people whose opinions would carry weight with you
	     
	     ms myers  they are people whose opinions carry weight 
certainly  i mean the president supports the process that they have 
initiated  but there is been no change in our policy for bosnia 
although we are considering a number of options right now  if the 
serbs do not come back to the negotiating table if they do not sign on 
to some kind of an agreement we will consider additional options 
which we have been saying regularly
	     
	     q	  one followup question then  we cannot get a 
straight answer from anyone in the administration  why do you not 
set a deadline for the serbs  can you tell us the strategic or 
tactical reasons for not giving them a deadline to come to the table
	     
	     ms myers  we are continuing to put pressure on them 
every day
	     
	     q	  which does not work so 
	     
	     ms myers  well we think it is having some effect  
we are going to continue to tighten sanctions  as you know we 
support the omnibus resolution  we expect that to come to a vote on 
the twentysixth  
	     
	     q	  you say it is having an effect  can you give us 
any documentation
	     
	     ms myers  i would be happy to provide somebody to talk to 
you about the impact of the sanctions and things like that
	     
	     q	  there is been no  you have not been able to 
provide anybody who can tell us that the sanctions have had any 
effect in bosnia  serbia yes in bosnia no
	     
	     ms myers  i think that they have had effect in serbia 
and we think they have had some effect in bosnia  and again i will be 
happy to provide somebody to walk you through the details of that if 
you would like
	     
	     q	  we would like to hear from someone who can show us 
what the effect has been in bosnia  we had the briefing on all of 
the terrible things that are happening in belgrade but we have not 
seen anything that indicates an impact on the fighting  can you 
provide something along those lines
	     
	     ms myers  i will see what i can get you
	     
	     q	  on the extra russian aid that christopher announced 
this morning  where is that money coming from
	     
	     ms myers  we will have to work with congress on the 
details of that package
	     
	     q	  so that would be new money that you would hope to 
get
	     
	     ms myers    yes that is new money in addition to the 
onesix billion announced in vancouver  so i assume that you all have 
seen the oneeightbillion package that was announced this morning in 
tokyo by secretary christopher
	     
	     q	  is not there a concern though about offering 
something which you have to get in congress  i mean that was the 
concern with vancouver you did not want to do that
	     
	     ms myers  the concern with vancouver was to do 
something immediately which required money that was already approved 
in the fiscal ninetythree budget  what we are looking at now is a little bit 
longerterm plan to build on top of the onesix billion that we 
announced in vancouver  this clearly will require congressional 
approval or some of it will anyway and we are going to continue to 
work with congress to make that happen
	     
	     q	  to what extent has that been vetted or agreed to by 
congress
	     
	     ms myers  the president has had a number of 
conversations with members and will continue to work with them as 
this process moves forward
	     
	     q	  was christopher able to put this package out with a 
fair degree of understanding that you will be able to get it through 
congress
	     
	     ms myers  it was created in consultation with 
congress
	     
	     q	  in meeting with the law enforcement officials is 
that  does that have a set speech and a goal  a direction
	     
	     ms myers  yes the president will talk about  and 
the law enforcement organizations are endorsing the presidents jobs 
package  they believe particularly the summer jobs package will help 
give kids something to do
	     
	     q	  who are they
	     
	     ms myers  it is members or leadership from three 
organizations  napo which is the national association of police 
organizations ibpo which is the international brotherhood of police 
organizations i believe and iupa which is the international union 
of police associations
	     
	     q	  will the fbi chief be there
	     
	     ms myers  the fbi chief  no
	     
	     q	  or any other federal law enforcement officials
	     
	     ms myers  no it will be the president and these 
national law enforcement organization leaders
	     
	     q	  does the oneeight billion announced today include the 
four hundred million that is in the fy ninetyfour budget for disarmament
	     
	     ms myers  no  the nunnlugar money is separate
	     
	     q	  so this would be the seven hundred million that is in the 
budget already plus another oneone billion
	     
	     ms myers  i believe all of this is on top of the seven hundred 
million already in the budget
	     
	     q	  is this going to be part of the supplemental or 
fiscal ninetyfour 
	     
	     ms myers  we will work with congress on the exact 
funding mechanism  on exactly how this will be paid for
	     
	     q	  this oneeight billion on top of 
	     
	     ms myers  on top of seven hundred million  on top of the four hundred 
million nunnlugar money we announced earlier
	     
	     q	  and this is what prompted the president to call bob 
dole  it was on this tranche not on the previous money he was 
calling bob dole
	     
	     ms myers  correct
	     
	     q	  is there a briefing on miyazawa
	     
	     ms myers  there will be a readout after the meeting 
with miyazawa  tomorrow
	     
	     q	  dee dee on a totally unrelated matter some 
republicans who are active in the yous chamber of commerce are 
complaining about this new cozy relationship between the white house 
and the chamber of commerce  there are  the town hall meeting the 
other night the satellite and all of this relationship
does the white house feel that you are getting too close to these 
chambers of commerce
	     
	     ms myers  that is an interesting charge  laughter  
after how many years of democrats being accused of not paying any 
attention to the chambers now there are those who would accuse us of 
being too close  i think that is interesting  but no we are thrilled 
by the support we have received from the national chamber and local 
chambers across the country and we will continue to work with them on 
this and other initiatives
	     
	     q	  what is the status of the president thinking about 
going to this democratic retreat
	     
	     ms myers  it is on his calendar  i think he will almost 
certainly go
	     
	     q	  all three days
	     
	     ms myers  we have not figured out exactly when he will be 
there yet  
	     
	     q	  is it open to coverage
	     
	     ms myers  no i believe the whole thing is closed
	     
	     q	  is he going to have any kind of address statement 
anything at all on the gay rights march on the twentyfiveth
	     
	     ms myers  we are still looking at that  we have not 
made a final decision about how we will  who will make a statement or 
what 
	     
	     q	  any meetings scheduled with any of the leaders
	     
	     ms myers  nothing is scheduled but i would not rule it 
out
	     
	     q	  what about an aids czar
	     
	     ms myers  it is coming
	     
	     q	  anything on the weekend
	     
	     q	  there is been a suggestion that he is going to this 
retreat to avoid having to participate in the gay rights  or appear 
or have any involvement in the gay rights march
	     
	     ms myers  no i think this is something he is been 
discussing for a long time  appearing at the senate democratic 
retreat
	     
	     q	  the weekend
	     
	     ms myers  weekend  do not know  the only thing on 
right now is the radio address on saturday
	     
	     q	  any travel plans
	     
	     ms myers  if it changes  none right now
	     
	     q	  he is not going to be off campaigning for his 
stimulus package
	     
	     ms myers  no specific plans right now
	     
	     q	  what about midweek  anything likely
	     
	     ms myers  it is possible  yes i think it is likely 
that we will travel next week  certainly the weekend
	     
	     q	  has he called thurmond about his daughter
	     
	     ms myers  i do not know  i will check
	     
	     q	  going to name a drug czar this weekend
	     
	     ms myers  this weekend  i do not believe so
	     
	     q	  and the radio address on saturday  is that going 
to be focused on the stimulus package
	     
	     ms myers  i am sure it will
	     
	     the press  thank you

   	the defenition of the underdog is a team that has no talent and comes
   out of nowhere to contend  the sixtynine mets and eightynine orioles are prime examples
   not the cubs 

   sorry but it is virtually impossible to win a division with no talent
   over one hundred and sixtytwo games

well with players certainly  however it is quite possible to win
it all with no managerial talent  cf blue jays one thousand nine hundred and ninetytwo

subject orchid pnine thousand vs fahrenheit mini review
organization adobe systems incorporated
xnewsreader tin version oneone plnine
lines seventynine


i just purchased a viewsonic seventeen and and orchid pnine thousand  in short i am happy
with the monitor and unhappy with the card  i have spent a lot more time
futzing with the card so that is what i am going to write about  the monitor
is pretty  the moires i had under simcity on my seventeen magnavox went away  it
is not as heavy as i thought it would be fortyfive lbs i think  so much for the
monitor  on to the bitch session and test results

in going with the modern trend the orchid pnine thousand card only supports sixteen colors
in six hundred and fortyxfour hundred and eighty mode without a driver  of course this breaks any dos program
which uses svga modes like most of my cdroms  the compudyne whiplash vga
orchid fahrenheit one thousand two hundred and eighty and orchid f vlb all share this limitation  those
are all sthree cards which means it is an sthree problem for them the pnine thousand uses
a weitek vga chip which also does not support them  the hercules graphite
card does seem to have these modes but i did not run the same test cases as
i did on the other boards during the brief time i had it  it was able to
print the splash screen for the groliers encyclopedia though which the sthree
cards just printed as hash which is why i suspect the svga modes are supported

the supported resolutions really annoy me  you can do one thousand two hundred and eightyxone thousand and twentyfour at seventyfivehz if
you tell the driver you have an nec fivefg they only have about six monitors
listed plus generic and if you choose generic you cannot get any high
refreshes at all  but at one thousand and twentyfourxseven hundred and sixtyeight you are limited to seventyhz  seems to me
that the hardware should be able to support the bandwidth if it can do seventyfivehz
at one thousand two hundred and eighty it sure should be able to do it at one thousand and twentyfour  higher vertical resolution
was the main reason i bought the card over the orchid f vlb i currently have
and it will do one thousand and twentyfourxseven hundred and sixtyeightxseventy hz as well

the higher graphics modes all crash hp dashboard  i just got off the phone
with orchid and with the oneone drivers i do not know what i have he was unable
to recreate the problem  on the plus side their tech rep was as helpful as
he could be and booted up the program on his computer to verify he did not have
the problem  he did not know why they limited the refresh to seventy hz either

the board is faster that the ofvlb for most things according to the hercules
speedy program this program tests various operations and reports the results
in pixelssecond  i do not have the numbers for the graphite card but they
were close to half of the ofvlb ie slower but that was running in a twentymhz
three hundred and eightysix isa so the numbers are not really comparable  the following numbers
were all obtained using a four hundred and eightysix thirtythree mhz air motherboard umc chipset with
eight mb memory  i give ranges because the program reports the numbers as it
computes them and these tend to jump around a bit


k means thousand not one thousand and twentyfour m means million pixels per second

the dib to screen test takes a device independent bitmap of a face and transfers
it to the screen  i have no idea what is being done internally as far as
conversions go  the memory to screen takes the same face and copies it to
the screen my guess is after it has been rasterized into a bitmap that can
just be copied to the video display  the screen to screen test copies that
face from place to place on the screen  awesome  interestingly the solid
vectors and shaded polygons show no improvement and hatched polygons ie
filled with crosshatching and ternary rops whatever they are  graphics
operations like xors maybe are a dead loss on the nine thousand  i give two
numbers for the nine thousand fonts because i think they are caching
when the fonts are first drawn on the screen they are done fairly slowly 
onethree the speed of the ofvlb  then the speed increases dramatically  sounds
like programming to a benchmark to me

i make no claims that these numbers mean anything at all  its just what
i saw when i ran them on my computer  i normally do not write disclaimers
but this time maybe i would better  my testing is totally unconnected with my
work i program under unix on decstations is done completely without the
knowledge blessing or equipment of my company

 but what came out
 in much lower profile reporting was that the victim was a
 prostitute and the man had not paid her  hence the false
 accusation
 
 there was no evidence the woman in question was a prostitute the
 defense merely alledged that she was even clayton knows the
 difference err perhaps clayton does not know the difference 

evidence given for her prostitute status besides the admittedly 
questionable claim of the man on trial included

one prior employment in a number of massage parlors with women who
claimed that she worked as a prostitute

two walking around a truck stop at fourzero am wearing a lace miniskirt
a halter top and no underwear of any sort

three not having a purse or other id with her

not enough to convict her but enough to create reasonable doubt
whether a rape actually took place or theft of services

are you just ignorant or lying again

 the judge found that there was some credible evidence that the 
 marines were engaged in selfdefense
 
 no the judge found that the prosecution did not carry out the burder
 on proof a small clipping from clarinews under fair use guidelines 
 
 	new hanover district court judge jacqueline morrisgoodson ruled in
 the benchtrial that the state failed to carry its burden in proving the
 marines acted to cause injury

the accounts on the evening news indicated that they claimed self
defense and the judge agreed that they were so operating

arab governments generally do not care much about the palestineans and

public support for the palestinean war against israel deflects
criticism from deep problems at home and lends an air of legitimacy to
even the most brutal arab tyrants

arab people probably are not much more sympathetic  palestineans
have shown a willingness to destabilize and plunder in jordan
lebanon and kuwait and are viewed with suspicion elsewhere

you might still be right in sympathy to the war against israel but i
suspect that many arabs far removed from the immediate border with
israel eg in kuwait or morroco could not care less

just to she would some light on the fire it was widely reported ap etc that
there were several witnesses to bd folks starting the fires  it has also
been reported that the fires broke out in several places at once which
rules out a bradley knocking over a lamp etc as the because

consider this the bds had more than one lamp the tanks made more than
one hole in the building did anyone else notice on the video that it
appeared that wherever there was smoke coming out of the building there
was a tank nearby

the fact that it appears that fires started in several places does not
rule out anything

also where are these several witnesses the way i heard it from the fbi
spokesman on cnn the witnesses were all people driving the tanks

one other point i am no fan of janet reno but i do like the way she had the
balls to go ahead and take full responsibility  seems like the waffle boy

some real fighters sprang up from among the people who struck terror

within a few months after the war began these armenian guerrilla
 forces operating in close coordination with the russians were
 savagely attacking turkish cities towns and villages in the east
 massacring their inhabitants without mercy while at the same time
 working to sabotage the ottoman armys war effort by destroying roads
 and bridges raiding caravans and doing whatever else they could to
 ease russian occupation the atrocities committed by the armenian 
 volunteer forces accompanying the russian army were so severe that the 
 russian commanders themselves were compelled to withdraw them from the 
 fighting fronts and sent them to rear guard duties the memoirs of many
 russian officers who served in the east at this time are filled with 
 accounts of the revolting atrocities committed by these armenian 
 guerrillas which were savage even by relatively primitive standards of
 war then observed in such areasone

 turkish genocide  well that debate seems to be going on in a few hundred
 other threads  i will let other people bring the usual charges try to debunk
 mutluargiccosar a netwide terrorism triangle and their spurious evidence
 
 when that does ever happen look out the window to see if there is a
 nonfascist xsoviet armenian government in the east now where is
 your nonexistent list of scholars what a moronian during the first 
 world war and the ensuing years  one thousand nine hundred and fourteenone thousand nine hundred and twenty the armenian dictatorship 
 through a premeditated and systematic genocide tried to complete its 
 centuriesold policy of annihilation against the turks and kurds by 
 savagely murdering twofive million muslims and deporting the rest from 
 their onezero year homeland

this paragraph is wellwritten and interesting serdar baby but it has nothing
to do with jews in latvia  i have not presented a list of scholars  

how could you because there is none

i am not
interested in an exsoviet why do you write x  it is very cute armenian
government nonfascist or otherwise  you are not responding to what i am
writing  instead you are autoposting your own particular brand of bullshit

like conversing with a brick wall and you are not responding to what i 
am writing by the way that bullshit is justly regarded as the first 
instance of genocide in the twentyth century acted upon an entire people
for nearly one thousand years the turkish and kurdish people lived 
on their homeland  the last one hundred under the oppressive soviet 
and armenian occupation the persecutions culminated in one thousand nine hundred and fourteen the 
armenian government planned and carried out a genocide against its 
muslim subjects twofive million turks and kurds were murdered and the 
remainder driven out of their homeland after one thousand years 
turkish and kurdish lands were empty of turks and kurds 

the survivors found a safe heaven in turkiye

today xsoviet armenian government rejects the right of turks and 
kurds to return to their muslim lands occupied by xsoviet armenia

today xsoviet armenia covers up the genocide perpetrated by its 
predecessors and is therefore an accessory to this crime against 
humanity

xsoviet armenia must pay for its crime of genocide against the muslims 
by admitting to the crime and making reparations to the turks and kurds

you have now done so four times in a row  may i legitimately conclude that
you are not indeed a regular netuser but an autoposting computer program

you may assert whatever you wish

happy the minority jews which has had no christian nation to protect it
 and one recalls that the jews took up their abode in fanatic turkey
 when they were expelled from europe especially spain by saintly christians
 and they have lived here for centuries in at least as much tranquility and
 liberty as their fellow turkish subjects all being exposed alike to the
 rapacity of their common rulers to one brought up as most americans have 
 been in the gladstonian and foreignmissionary tradition the condition of 
 the jews in turkey is almost a mathematical demonstration that religious
 differences have had an influence in the tragedy of turkey only as they
 were combined with aspirations for a political separation which every 
 nation in the world would have treated as treasonable one readily 
 reaches the conclusion that the jews in turkey were fortunate 

he also stated that

they armenians traitorously turned turkish cities over to the russian 
 invader that they boasted of having raised an army of one hundred and
 fifty thousand men to fight a civil war and that they burned at least
 a hundred turkish villages and exterminated their population

 i want the documents of jews in latvia  i think several other

it could be perhaps your head was not screwed on just right in one thousand nine hundred and fortyone 
while the jews were being assembled for their doom in the nazi concentration 
camps the armenian volunteers in germany formed the first armenian 
battalion to fight alongside the nazis in one thousand nine hundred and fortythree this battalion had 
grown into eight battalions of twentyzerostrong under the command of the
former guerilla leader dro the butcher who was the former dictator of the
shortlived armenian dictatorship one thousand nine hundred and eighteenone thousand nine hundred and twenty and the architect of the 
coldblooded genocide of twofive million turks and kurds between one thousand nine hundred and fourteenone thousand nine hundred and twenty
an armenian national council was formed by the notorious dashnak party 
leaders in berlin which was recognized by the nazis encouraged by 
this the armenians summarily formed a provisional government that endorsed 
and espoused fully the principles of the nazis and declared themselves as the 
members of the aryan super race and full participants to hitlers policy of 
extermination of the jews

this armeniannazi conspiracy against the jews during wwii was an encore
performance staged by the armenians during wwi when they backstabbed and
exterminated twofive million turks by colluding with the invading russian army

furthermore as mccarthy put it the armenian dictatorship was granted
a respite when the ottomans admitted defeat and signed the mudros
armistice with the allies october thirty one thousand nine hundred and eighteen the allies had decided
to create a greater armenia including the old russian province
of yerevan and adjoining areas as well as most parts of anatolia
claimed by the armenian fanatics only the area called cilicia
around the ottoman province of adana was to be excluded as it
had already been claimed by the french the allies quickly set
about attempting to disarm ottoman soldiers and other turks who
could be expected to oppose their plans 

on april nineteen one thousand nine hundred and nineteen the british army occupied kars gave civilian
and military power over to the armenians then withdrew the british
planned for kars to be included in the armenian dictatorship even 
though the russian prewar census had shown kars province to be over
sixty muslim the turks of kars were effectively disarmed but the 
british could not disarm the kurds of the mountains the fate of
the turks was almost an exact replica of what had occurred earlier
in eastern anatolia murder pillage genocide and the destruction
of turkish homes and entire turkish villages drove the turks of
kars to the mountains or south and west to the safety afforded
by remaining units of the ottoman army the british had left 
the scene to the armenian genocide squads therefore few 
europeans were present to observe the genocide one british
soldier colonel rawlinson who was assigned to supervise the
disarmament of otoman soldiers saw what was occurring 

rawlinson wired to his superiors 

in the interest of humanity the armenians should not be left in
 independent command of the moslim population as their troops 
 being without discipline and not being under effective control
 atrocities were constantly being committed

 these two beautiful cities of our country which are alike in the
 calamities and destruction which they suffered have been destroyed
 as the specially designed and built public and private buildings of
 these cities were deliberately burnt by armenians apart from the 
 destruction suffered during the twoyear russian occupation

 all barracks buildings of erzincan the cavalry barracks in erzurum
 the government building and army corps headquarters are among those
 burnt in short both cities are burnt destroyed and trees cut down

 as to the people of these cities

 all people old enough to use weapons rounded up taken to the sarikamis
 direction for road building and were slaughtered the remaining people
 were subject to cruelties and murder by armenians following the 
 withdrawal of russians and were partly annihilated the corpses thrown 
 into wells burnt in houses mutilated by bayonets their abdomens
 ripped open in slaughterhouses their lungs and livers torn out girls
 and women hung up by their hair after all kinds of devilish acts
 the few people who were able to survive these cruelties worse than
 those of the spanish inquisition are in poverty more dead than alive
 horrified some driven insane about one thousand five hundred in erzincan and thirtyzero in
 erzurum the people are hungry and in poverty for whatever they had
 has been taken away from them their lands left uncultivated

 the people have just been able to exist with some provisions found in
 stores left over from the russians the villages round erzincan and 
 erzurum are in the worst condition some villages on the road have 
 been leveled to the ground leaving no stone the people completely
 massacred

 let me submit to your information with deep grief and regret that
 history has never before witnessed cruelties at such dimensions

in article  jschwimmerwccnetwccwesleyanedu josh schwimmer writes

i have recently listened to a tape by dr stanislaw burzynski in which he 
claims to have discovered a series naturally occuring peptides with anti
cancer properties that he names antineoplastons  burzynski says that his 
work has met with hostility in the united states despite the favorable 
responses of his subjects during clinical trials

what is the generally accepted opinion of dr burzynskis research  he 
paints himself as a lone researcher with a new breakthrough battling an 
intolerant medical establishment but i have no basis from which to judge 
his claims  two weeks ago however i read that the nihs department of 
alternative medicine has decided to focus their attention on burzynskis 
work  their budget is so small that i imagine they would not investigate a 
treatment that did not seem promising

any opinions on burzynskis antineoplastons or information about the current 
status of his research would be appreciated


joshua schwimmer
jschwimmereaglewesleyanedu

there is been extensive discussion on the compuserve cancer forum about dr 
burzynskis treatment as a result of the decision of a forum members father 
to undertake his treatment for brain glioblastoma  this disease is 
universally and usually rapidly fatal  after diagnosis in june one thousand nine hundred and ninetytwo the 
tumor was growing rapidly despite radiation and chemotherapy  the forum 
member checked extensively on dr burzynkis track record for this disease  
he spoke to a few patients in complete remission for a few years from 
glioblastoma following this treatment and to an nci oncologist who had 
audited other such case histories and found them valid and impressive  
after the forum members father began dr burzynskis treatment in 
september all subsequent scans performed under the auspices of his 
oncologist in chicago have shown no tumor growth with possible signs of 
shrinkage or necrosis

the patients oncologist although telling him he would probably not live 
past december one thousand nine hundred and ninetytwo was vehemently opposed to his trying dr burzynskis 
treatment  since the tumor stopped its rapid growth under dr burzynskis 
treatment she is since changed her attitude toward continuing these 
treatments saying if it are not broke do not fix it

dr burzynski is an md phd with a research background who found a 
protein that is at very low serum levels in cancer patients synthesized it 
and administers it to patients with certain cancer types  there is little 
understanding of the actual mechanism of activity

i am still not sure how this is supposed to work since the zip files

however i managed to install pads and i am pretty impressed  i created
a couple of schematics without problem but whenever i try to

it does not work  i am wondering if maybe a file is not where it should

that the evil ackers kidnapped the real os staff and are currently in the

above and the expos bullpen barnes walton fassero gardiner and
rojas have been the prime target apparently john wetteland was roughed
up by the ackpeople during spring training due to the fact that his

yes but fortunately religions have been replaced by systems
that value human rights higher

secular laws seem to value criminal life more than the victims life
islam places the rights of society and every member in it above 
the rights of the individual this is what i call true human rights

 
by the way do you actually support the claim of precedence of islamic
law in case you do what about the laws of other religions

as a muslim living in a nonmuslim land i am bound by the laws of the land
i live in but i do not disregard islamic law it still remains a part of my 
life if the laws of a land conflict with my religion to such an extent
that i am prevented from being allowed to practise my religion then i must 
leave the land so in a way islamic law does take precendence over secular law
but we are instructed to follow the laws of the land that we live in too

in an islamic state one ruled by a khaliphate religions other than islam
are allowed to rule by their own religious laws provided they do not affect
the genral population and do not come into direct conflict with state 
laws dhimmis nonmuslim population are exempt from most islamic laws
on religion such as fighting in a jihad giving zakat alms giving
etc but are given the benefit of these two acts such as military
protection and if they are poor they will receive zakat

 
if not what has it got to do with rushdie and has anyone reliable
information if he had not left islam according to islamic law
or is the burden of proof on him
   benedikt

after the fatwa did not rushdie reaffirm his faith in islam did not
he go thru a very public conversion to islam if so he is binding
himself to islamic laws he has to publicly renounce in his belief in islam
so the burden is on him

how about this question instead

q   suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on
     a political opponent of a senior administration official and
     intercepts a conversation

kind of changes your interpretation of the event does not it  and yes
the presence of the clipper chip does change things because it will
not only give the people talking on the phone a false sense of security
it will also give federal law enforcement agencies the justification
to deny use of strong encryption methods that are inconvenient to them
dang it all it is supposed to be inconvenient but not impossible
that is the only sure way to make sure that abuses are minimized while
still allowing legitimate law enforcement access


q   how strong is the security in the device  how can i be sure
     how strong the security is  

a   this system is more secure than many other voice encryption
     systems readily available today  while the algorithm will
     remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow
     system we are willing to invite an independent panel of
     cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all
     potential users that there are no unrecognized
     vulnerabilities

uh huh sure  i predict that within two months weeks of the chips
debut the full technical details will be posted to scicrypt  and if
this has any impact on the security of the key escrow system then we have
been lied to  any cryptosystem worth its salt can withstand the light
of public scrutiny and there is no way you can be sure that an
algorithm has no unrecognized vulnerabilities unless you have half
the world trying to break it for a decade or so  even then you got to
be careful

this might a real wierd idea or maybe not

i have seen where people have blown up ballons then sprayed material into them
that then drys and makes hard walls

why not do the same thing for a space station

fly up the docking rings and baloon materials and such blow up the baloons
spin then around i know a problem in micro gravity let them drycureharden
and cut a hole for the dockingattaching ring and bingo a space station

of course the ballons would have to be foil covered or someother radiation
protective coveringheat shield and the material used to make the wals would
have to meet the out gasing and other specs or atleast the paintcovering of
the inner wall would have to be human safe maybe a special congrete or maybe
the same material as makes caplets but with some changes saw where someone
instea dof water put beer in the caplet mixture got a mix that was just as
strong as congret but easier to carry around and such

 the signal  now i was wondering how can i improve the signal
 is it possible to improve the signal significantly some channels
 
 cable egress or emanations if you will are being radiated at free space 
 impedance from cables that may be harmonically realated to certain 
 channels and therfore the standing waves at onefour wave will transfer 
 efficiently also your antenna a loose monopole is also harmonically 
 tuned and will be more efficient at onetwo wavelength multiples
 
 your best bet for this research is to use a tuned yagi antenna to get the 
 gain you need std tv roof antenna type the dipoles should be parallel 
 to the radiating cable a preamp does not help significantly in my

organization you of wisconsinmadison college of engineering
lines one hundred and twentyseven

hello src readers

again the misconception that copts among other oriental orthodox
churches believe in monophysitism pops up again we had a discussion
about it a while ago 

in article  dbsevennandrewcmuedu d andrew byler writes

the proper term for what mike expresses is monophysitism  this was a
heresy that was condemned in the council of chalcedon in four hundred and fiftyone ad  it
grew up in reaction to nestorianism which held that the son and jesus
are two different people who happened to be united in the same body
temporarily  monophysitism is held by the copts of egypt and ethipoia
and by the jacobites of syria and the armenian orthodox 

then ofm comments 



these issues get mighty subtle  when you see people saying different
things it is often hard to tell whether they really mean seriously
different things or whether they are using different terminology  i
do not think there is any question that there is a problem with
nestorius and i would agree that the saying christ had a human form
without a real human nature or will is heretical  but i would like to be
a bit wary about the copts armenians etc  recent discussions
suggest that their monophysite position may not be as far from
orthodoxy as many had thought 

with my appreciation to the moderator i believe that further elaboration
is needed this is an excerpt from an article featured in the first issue
of the coptnet newsletter 

under the authority of the eastern roman empire of constantinople as opposed
to the western empire of rome the patriarchs and popes of alexandria played
leading roles in  christian theology  they were  invited everywhere to speak
about the christian faith st cyril pope of alexandria was the head of the
ecumenical council which was held in ephesus in the year four hundred and thirty ad it was said
that the bishops of the church of alexandria did nothing but spend  all their
time in meetings this leading role however did not fare well when politics
started to intermingle with  church affairs  it all started when the emperor
marcianus interfered with matters of faith in the church the response of st
dioscorus the pope of alexandria who was later  exiled to this interference
was clear you have nothing to do with the church  these political motives
became even more  apparent in chalcedon  in four hundred and fiftyone when the coptic  church  was
unfairly  accused of following  the  teachings of  eutyches who believed  in
monophysitism this  doctrine maintains that the  lord jesus christ  has only
one nature the divine not two natures the human as well as the divine

the coptic  church   has never  believed  in  monophysitism  the way   it was
portrayed in the council of chalcedon  in  that council monophysitism meant
believing in one  nature  copts   believe that the lord   is perfect in  his
divinity  and he   is perfect in  his humanity  but  his  divinity  and his
humanity were united in one nature called the nature of the incarnate word
which was reiterated by st cyril of alexandria  copts thus believe in two
natures human and   divine  that are   united in   one without mingling
without confusion and without alteration from the  declaration of faith at
the end of the coptic divine liturgy  these  two  natures did not separate
for a moment or the twinkling of an eye also from  the declaration of faith
at the end of the coptic divine liturgy

the  coptic church was  misunderstood in the fiveth century  at the  council  of
chalcedon  perhaps the council  understood   the church correctly but  they
wanted to exile the  church   to  isolate it  and to  abolish the  egyptian
independent pope despite  all of this  the coptic church  has remained very
strict  and steadfast in its faith   whether it was   a  conspiracy from the
western churches to exile the coptic church  as a  punishment for its refusal
to be politically influenced or whether pope dioscurus  did not  quite go the
extra  mile to  make the  point that  copts  are not  monophysite the coptic
church has always felt a mandate  to reconcile semantic differences between
all  christian  churches   this is   aptly  expressed by the  current  one hundred and seventeenth
successor  of  st mark pope shenouda iii  to the  coptic church faith is
more  important  than  anything and   others  must know that  semantics  and
terminology are of  little importance to us  throughout this  century  the
coptic church has played  an important role  in the ecumenical  movement the
coptic church is one of the founders of the world council of churches it has
remained a member of that  council  since one thousand nine hundred and fortyeight ad   the coptic church is  a
member  of the all  african council of churches  aacc  and the  middle east
council of  churches mecc  the church    plays an  important role   in the
christian   movement   by   conducting dialogues   aiming  at  resolving  the
theological differences with the  catholic greek orthodox presbyterian and
evangelical churches



as a final note the oriental orthodox and eastren orthodox did sign
a common statement of christology in which the heresey of monophysitism
was condemned so the coptic orthodox church does not believe in
monophysitism

peace

as i mentioned in a brief apology the comment quoted above from me
is confused  i appear to say that nestorius was monophysite  as
andrew byler correctly stated it the nestorians and monophysites were
actually opposite parties  the point i was making which nabil
explains in some detail is that some groups that have been considered
heretical probably are not

chalcedon was a compromise between two groups the alexandrians and
antiochenes  it adopted language that was intended to be acceptable
to moderates in both camps while ruling out the extremes  i agree
that there were extremes that were heretical  however in the course
of the complex politics of the time it appears that some people got
rejected who did not intend heresy but simply used language that was
not understood or even was mispresented  and some seem not to have
jointed in the compromise for reasons other than doctrine  there are
groups descended from both of the supposedly heretical camps  this
posting discussed the descendants of the alexandrians  there are also
a remaining nestorians  like some of the current socalled
monophysites there is reason to believe that the current socalled
nestorians are not heretical either  they sheltered nestorius from
what they saw as unfair treatment but claim they did not adopt his
heresies and in fact seem to follow more moderate representatives of
the antiochene tradition

in article seventeenaprone hundred and ninetynine billion three hundred and sixteen million four hundred and twentythree thousand six hundred and twentyeightjudyuhedu wingocsparadecnetfedexmsfcnasagov writes

i do not care who told you this it is not generally true i see every single
line item on a contract and i have to sign it there is no such thing as
wrap at this university 

dennis i have worked on or written proposals worth tens of millions
of  customers included government including nasa for profit and
nonprofit companies all expected a wrap usually called a fee much
of the work involved allocating and costing the work of subcontractors
the subcontractors where universities forprofits nonprofits and
even some of the nasa centers for the commercialization of space all
charged fees as part of the work down the street is one of the nasa
commercialization centers they charge a fee

now i am sure your a competent engineer dennis but you clearly lack
experience in several areas your posts show that you do not understand
the importance of integration in large projects you also show a lack
of understanding of costing efforts as shown by your belief that it
is reasonable to charge incremental costs for everything this is not
a flame jsut a statement

your employer does charge a fee you may not see it but you do

sounds like they are adding it to their overhead rate go ask your
costing people how much fee they add to a project

i did they never heard of it but suggest that like our president did that
any percentage number like this is included in the overhead

well there you are dennis as i said they simply include the fee in
their overhead many seoparate the fee since the fee structure can
change depending on the customer

no allen you did not you merely repeated allegations made by an employee
of the overhead capital of nasa 

integration dennis is not overhead

nothing that reston does could not be do not
better or cheaper at the other nasa centers  where the work is going on

dennis reston has been the only nasa agency working to reduce costs when
wp two was hemoraging out a billion  the centers you love so much where
doing their best to cover it up and ignore the problem reston was the
only place you would find people actually interested in solving the
problems and building a station

kind of funny is not it that someone who talks about a problem like this is
at a place where everything is overhead

when you have a bit more experience dennis you will realize that
integration is not overhead it is the single most important part
of a successful large scale effort

why did the space news artice point out that it was the congressionally
demanded change that caused the problems methinks that you are being 
selective with the facts again

the story you refer to said that some nasa people blamed it on
congress suprise suprise the fact remains that it is the centers
you support so much who covered up the overheads and would not address
the problems until the press published the story

are you saying the reston managers where wrong to get nasa to address
the overruns you approve of what the centers did to cover up the overruns

if it takes four flights a year to resupply the station and you have a cost
of five hundred million a flight then you pay two billion a year you stated that your
friend at reston said that with the current station they could resupply it
for a billion a year if the wrap were gone this merely points out a 
blatent contridiction in your numbers that understandably you fail to see

you should know dennis that nasa does not include transport costs for
resuply that comes from the shuttle budget what they where saying
is that operational costs could be cut in half plus transport

sorry gang but i have a deadline for a satellite so someone else is going
to have to do allens math for him for a while i will have little chance to
do so

i do hope you can find the time to tell us just why it was wrong of
reston to ask that the problems with wp two be addressed

 stuff deleted 
    i wrote
    are you calling names or giving me a title if the first read your 
    paragraph above if not i accept the title in order to let you get into the
    um well debate again

   hasan replies
   i didnot know that master of wisdom can be name clling too
   unless you consider yourself deserveless 

unless you are referring to someone else you have in fact given me a name 
i did not ask for hence the term name calling

   hasan writes
       so what do you expect me to tell you to tell you master of wsidom 
    							       
    
   i replied
    if you insist on giving me namestitles i did not ask for you could at
    least spell them correctly sigh

   hasan gloats
   that was only to confuse you ha ha ha hey 

hellbent on retarding into childhood no 

   when you are intentionally neglecting the most important fact that 
   the whole israeli presence in the occupied territories is illegitimate 
   and hence all their actions their courts their laws are illegitimate on 
   the ground of occupied territories
    
   no i am not neglecting that i am merely asking you whether the existance
   of israeli citicens in the wb or in gaza invalidates those individuals 
   right
                are you trying to retaliate and confuse me here

no i really do try to spell correctly and i apologize if i did confuse you
i will try not to repeat that

    to live a as you so eloquently put it human right we can get back to the 
    question of which law should be used in the territories later also you have 
    not adressed my question if the israelis also have human rights


   first my above statement doesnot say that the existence of israeli citizens
   in the wb revoke their right of life but it says the israeli occupation
   of the wb revoke the right of life for somemost its citizens  basically
   revokes the right of for its military men clearly occupation is an
   undeclared war during war attacks against military targets are fully legitimate 

ok let me rephrase the question i have repeatedly asked you if the 
israelis have less human rights than the palestinians and if so why
from your posting where you did not directly adress my question i inferred
that you thought so together with the above statement i then assumed that the
reason was the actions of the state of israel re your statement of 
occupation i would like you to define the term so i do not have to repeat this
drag the answer out of hasan procedure more than neccesary

   secondly surely israeli have human rights but they ask their goverment to
   protect it by withdrawing from the occupied terretories not by further oppressing
   palestinean human rights

i am sorry but the above sentence does not make sense please rephrase it


    if a state can deprive all it is citizens of human rights by its actions then 
    tell me why any human living today should have any rights at all


   because not all states are like israel as oppressive as ignorant or as tyrant

oh ok so how about the human rights of the syrians iraqis and others
does the name of hama sound familiar or how about the kurds in iraq and
turkey 
how about the same in sweden ok maybe a bit farfetched the russians in
the baltic states or the moslem in the old ussr and yugoslavia
do the serbs have any human rights remainaing according to you


        and which system do you propose we use to solve the me problem
    
       the question is not which system would solve the me problem why  because
       any system can solve it 
       the laws of minister sharon says kick palestineans out of here all palestine 
    
    i asked for which system should be used that will preserve human rights for 
      
    all people involved i assumed that was obvious but i will not repeat that 
    mistake now that i have straightened that out i am eagerly awaiting your 
    reply

   so you agree that that an israeli solution wouldnot preserve human rights
   i am understanding this from your first statement in this paragraph

no i am agreeing that to just kick all the palestinians out of israel proper 
would probably lead to disaster for both parties if that is what you refer 
to as the israeli solution then so be it

       joseph weitz administrator responsible for jewish colonization 
       said it best when writing in his diary in one thousand nine hundred and forty
    	   between ourselves it must be clear that there is no room for both
    	   peoples together in this country we shall not achieve our goal
    						                  
    	   of being an independent people with the arabs in this small country
    	   the only solution is a palestine at least western palestine west of
    	   the jordan river without arabs and there is no other way than
    	   to transfer the arabs from here to the neighbouring countries to
    	   transfer all of them not one village not one tribe should be 
    	   left only after this transfer will the country be able to
    	   absorb the millions of our own brethren there is no other way out

 just a question if we are to disregard the rather obvious references to 
 getting israel out of me one way or the other in both plo covenant and hamas
 charter that is the english translations if you have other information i would
 be interested to have you translate it why should we give any credence to 
 a private paper even older i am not going to get into the question if he
 wrote the above but it is fairly obvious all parties in the conflict have
 their share of fanatics guess what those are not the people that will
 make any lasting peace in the region more deleted stuff

exactly you are right i guess that the problem is that the israeli govermentis full with  men like joseph weitz 

oh have you met with them personally to read their diaries fascinating
what do you do for a living

    we and our either refers to zionists or jews i donot know which 
 
    well i can give you an answer you master of wisdom i will not suggest the 
    imperialist israeli system for solving the me problem 
 
    i think that is fair enough 
 
 no that is not an answer since i asked for a system that could solve 
 the problem you said any could be used then you provided a contradiction

   above you wrote that you understood what i meant underlined by   
   any system can be used to solve the conflict  but not any system would 
   resolve it justly

an unjust solution would be a nonsolution per definition no
you said the following

for all a it holds that a have property b
there exists an a such that property b does not hold

thus either or both statements must be false

    guess where that takes your logic to nevernever land 

you are proving yourself as a   first you understood what i meant but then
you claim you didnot so to claim a contradiction in my logic 
too bad for you the master of wisdom

i was merely pointing out a not so small flaw in your reasoning
since you claim to be logical i felt it best to point this out
before you started using your statements to prove a point or so
am i then to assume you are  not logical

    the greatest problem of zionism is arab children
 			   rabbi shoham
 
 oh and by the way let me add that these cute quotes you put at the end are
 a real bummer when i try giving your posts any credit

why do you feel ashamed by things and facts that you believe in  
if you were a zionists if you believe in zionist codes and acts 
well i feel sorry for you because the same rabbi shoham had said 
yes zionism is racism
if you feel ashamed and bothered by the zionist codes then drop zionism
if you are not zionist why are you bothered then you should join me in
condemning these racist zionist codes and acts

any quote can be misused especially when used to stereotype all 
individuals by a statement of an individual if you use the same
methods that you credit zionists with then where does that place you

oh by the way i would advice you not to assume anything about my loyalties
i will and am condemning acts i find vile and inhuman but i will try as 
long as i can not to assume those acts are by a whole people
by zionist above do you mean the state of israel the government of israel 
the leaders of israel political andor religious or the jews in
general if you feel the need to condemn condemn those responsible
instead how would you feel if we started condemning you personally
based on the bombings in egypt

 all your points are very well taken and things that i have not considered as
 i am not really familiar enough with handguns
 
 that is not all that kratz does not know
 
 hell a glock is the last thing that should be switched to  the only thing
 that i know about a glock is the lack of a real safety on it  sure there is
 that little thing in the trigger but that is not too great of a safety
 
 now we know that kratz does not understand what a safety is supposed to
 do  he also confuses things he can see with things that exist
 glocks have multiple safeties even though only one is visible from the
 outside
 
 a safety is supposed to keep the gun from going off unless that is
 what the user wants  with glocks one says i want the gun to go
 off by pulling the trigger  if the safeties it has make that work
 it has a real safety no matter what kratz thinks

clarinewsclarinetcom upi writes in clarisportshockey

	new york upi  mike keenan whose nhl coaching history
has been to wear out his welcome despite an impressive penchant for 
winning has come to the city that embraces victors above all else

well i could become a fan  

seriously this news coming since thursday has effectively robbed the
islanders and the devils of any airtime on sports talk shows almost
everywhere that i have sampled  in fact the playoffs almost do not
exist now  ranger fans calling in to wfan or to new york ones
midnight sports talk were in a mix of fury over this season and near
orgasm over keenans hiring  summarizing keenan is a winner and
will give the broadway bums da business in pursuing the next cup
chase 

	the chicago blackhawks cut their last tie with keenan when
he was forced out as general manager in november he had given up
chicagos coaching duties a year ago and his thirst for the power
of a gm now increases the pressure on beleaguered rangers gm neil
smith

this will be an interesting combination to watch  keenan has been
paid enough money to put up and shut up and just be a coach but his
advice on any player moves will be listened to closely  a lot of big
player moves will happen  remember that keenan got rid of denis
savard  the country club days are over 

	when keenan left chicago i could not help but think about 
him as our coach smith said there was an indication he would 
be taken off the market i feared that and could not let that happen

if paramount had given smith an earlier sign of support and offered
keenan the big money to putupandshutup back in january the
rangers might not be heading for golf now 

	keenan fortythree takes on a demoralized team that offers him a
chance to fashion yet another of his reclamation projects  at the
highest salary ever commanded by an nhl coach the rangers  owned
by gulf  western  have bestowed upon keenan an unprecedented three
million fouryear deal

	i have known mike a long time messier said we have won two
canada cups together he is been to the finals three times maybe we
miss just one more element to win the stanley cup i do not think he is
the same person he was ten years ago or even five years ago i think he
has changed and bettered himself with experience

one of keenans first statements was a reaffirmation that mark messier
will be the teams captain

	the timing of the move gives the rangers new coach two onetwo
months to prepare for the nhl draft june twentysix and neil smith may 
not back off the their tradehappy pattern

by then smith might have some bargains on keenans advice  like
maybe unloading phil bourque for tie domi

 i also have a dxtwosixtysix and a maxtor two hundred and twelve i have a local bus ide controller generic and i get
 nine hundred and eightyfive kbs i tried swapping my local bus ide controller for an isa ide controller and my
 transfer rate went to eight hundred and thirty kbs the specs for this drive show a maximum platter to controller
 transfer rate of twoeightythree mbs i do not know how to get there from here the local bus interface
 got me a little but certainly not as much as i had hoped i am also looking for a way to 

what is the deal with the ide transfer rates  is anybody getting throughput
anywhere close to the plattercontroller rate  i have not seen anything
even close to the fivembsec limit of the ide interface  these drives are oneone
noninterleaved are not they

here are the rates i get

one sequential read msdos c program that uses bios calls to read sixtyfoursector
                    blocks sequentially from outside first track inward

                     eightmhz bus    tenmhz bus
                         
   maxtor lxtthree hundred and forty    eight hundred and sixtykbsec   nine hundred and seventysixkbsec
   quantum lpstwo hundred and forty   eight hundred and sixtytwokbsec   eight hundred and eightysevenkbsec

two disk buffer read same c program but rereads the same block repeatedly
                     so in effect is reading the ram buffer on the drive

                     eightmhz bus    tenmhz bus
                         
   maxtor lxtthree hundred and forty   one thousand and fortysixkbsec  one thousand two hundred and twelvekbsec
   quantum lpstwo hundred and forty  one thousand and fifteenkbsec  one thousand two hundred and seventysixkbsec

three coretest vtwoseven transfer rate seems to agree with two above

                     eightmhz bus    tenmhz bus
                         
   maxtor lxtthree hundred and forty   one thousand and fiftyonekbsec  one thousand two hundred and twentyfourkbsec
   quantum lpstwo hundred and forty  one thousand and twentysixkbsec  one thousand two hundred and ninetyeightkbsec

i managed to get hold of the quantum lpstwo hundred and fortyat product manual and it goes
into excrutiating detail describing how the bits get from the platter
through the controller and out the ide interface  nowhere do i see
anything like after the bits are whipped of the platter at high speed
they sit around in a buffer to thaw before they are sent to the host
even though i swear that is what is happening   here are some relevent
quotes from the manual

  data is transferred from the disk to the read buffer at a rate of
   threeseventyfive mbs maximum oneeightysevenmbs minimum  my calculations show three thousand one hundred and twentyonekbsec
   maximum and one thousand five hundred and seventyeightkbsec minimum  disk spins at four thousand three hundred and six rpm with eightyseven
   sectors per track on the outside and fortyfour on the inside

  single burst errors of up to twentyfour bits within one sector can be corrected
   onthefly in real time as they occur allowing a high degree of
   data integrity with no impact to the drives performance  i take
   this to mean error correction is not the bottleneck

  for pagemode operations the datatransfer rate to and from the buffer
   ram is up to tenzero mbs this high transfer rate allows the at interface
   ic to communicate over the at bus at a datatransfer rate of fivezero mbs
   while the dcs simultaneously controls disktoram transfers
                 
so the thing can even do it is cache prefetch while it is sending the
requested sector it has three sixtyfourkb read buffers for prefetching i guess
you could call that a cache 

so when i do a sequential read on the outer tracks why am i getting a
measly eight hundred and sixtytwokbsec when i should be getting around threembsec

any of you harddisk engineers out there know


wondering why my disks are so slow

i just recently realized that i am bisexual and also just recently returned to
religion and have a good friend who has pointed out to me that homosexuality
is a sin in the bible  well i do not see how it could be considered a sin

first of all as far as i know only male homosexuality is explicitly
mentioned in the bibles so you are off the hook there i think in
any event there are plenty of people in many denominations who
do not consider a persons sexual identification of gaylesbianbisexual
as an immoral lifestyle choice

also i have always been a somewhat liberal feminist and am prochoice and it
seems that being prochoice and being religious do not mix either  i am told

this is another misconception you are not being told the whole story

my former minister is a lesbian and i know personally and
professionally several openly gay and lesbian ministers i am
a unitarianuniversalist and like most others in my denomination
am prochoice you need not go looking to the unitarian universalists
which is a liberal religion for acceptance of your sexual
identification and prochoice views however there are many of us
who believe in spirituality and freedom of conscience

good luck on your journey

why do spacecraft have to be shut off after funding cuts  for
example why could not magellan just be told to go into a safe
mode and stay bobbing about venus in a lowpoweruse mode and if
maybe in a few years if funding gets restored after the economy
gets better hopefully it could be turned on again  
 
it can be but the problem is a political one not a technical one

also remember that every dollar spent keeping one spacecraft in safe mode
probably a spinstabilized sunpointing orientation is a dollar not
spent on mission analysis for a newer spacecraft  in order to turn the
spacecraft back on you either need to insure that the ops guys will be
available or you need to retrain a new team

having said that there are some spacecraft that do what you have proposed
many of the operational satellites goddard flies like the tiros noaa 
series require more than one satellite in orbit for an operational set
extras which get replaced onorbit are powered into a standby mode for
use in an emergency  in that case however the same ops team is still
required to fly the operational birds so the standby maintenance is
relatively cheap

finally pats explanation some spacecraft require continuous maintenance
to stay under control is also right on the mark  i suggested a spin
stabilized control mode because it would require little power or 
maintenance but it still might require some momentum dumping from time
to time

in the end it is a political decision since the difference is money
but there is some technical rationale behind the decision

be wrong  i think the later kadetts were sold here as buick opels

	i think the manta is the european name for the gt  i am pretty sure
well the european manta and us gt have entirely different bodies there is
little or no chance that they are the same the manta went through several
generations as the coupe version of the ascona and was ok in its time

that the only kadetts sold here wereare the pontiac lemans  i think the

not true the kadett has been in and out of the us market over the years
the lemans old kadett is only the latest version

 has anyone looked into the possiblity of a protoncentaur combo
 what would be the benefits and problems with such a combo other
 than the obvious instability in the xssr now
 
 
 the centaur for the altas is about three meters dia and the proton 
 is four so that is a good fit for their existing upper stage the blockd
 which sets inside a shround just under four meters dia i do not know about
 launch loads etc but since the centaur survives titan launches which
 are probably worse than the proton those titan srbs probably shake things
 up pretty good it seems feasible except the centaur is a very fragile
 thing and may require integration on the pad which is not available now
 protons are assembled and transported horizontially does anyone know 
 how much stress in the way of a payload a centaur could support while
 bolted to a proton horizontally and then taken down the rail road track
 and erected on the pad  

the centaur that is being built for tfour would be a better bet to integrate 
onto the proton as the tfourcentaur is designed for the extremely harsh 
envorinment of the tfour launch it is also closer to four m in diameter 

you have hit on the real kicker however the centaur is pressure stabilized 
it cannot hold up its own weight without pressure in the tanks additionally 
the pressure difference between the two tanks must be maintained to  five psi 
that is rather tight to be rocking and rolling on the train the pressure 
stabilization is how centaur achieves the performance on numerous occasions
when i was there eightyeightninetyone the af wanted to see what it would take to make 
a nonpressure stabilized centaur the answer  a centaur not worth launching 

the atlascentaur does not require onpad integration however the tfourcentaur
does i believe the onpad integration is to a great extent due to the 
cleanliness requirements and pfl configuration so maybe something can be 
done there


 
 they would also need lox and lh facilities added to the proton pads 
 unless the new proton second stage is actually built and of course
 any centaur support systems and facilities no doubt imported from the
 us at great cost these systems may viloate us law so there are political
 problems to solve in addition to the instabilities in the cis you mention 

the addition of loxlh facilities is critical as the centaur tops off as it 
lifts off a lhe facility is also needed i do not know what the proton uses 
for fuel but since they are derived from icbms i would suspect that they 
use storable propellants which do not have the ullage problem that cryos 
do if there is no cryo at the sight at all the addition of these systems 
could be big  not to mention the real tech transfer issues involved with 
providing centaur gse to russia that issue alone might be enough to kill 
this idea

 i posted this a while ago and did not receive one reply and now we
 have another bug report on the same subject can anybody help me out
 
 the problem is that motif uses xgrabkey to implement menu accelerators
 and these grabs are specific about which modifiers apply  unfortunately
 the specification for xgrabkey does not allow anymodifier to be combined
 with other modifiers which is exactly what would be desired in this case
 ctrl anyq
 
 in ora vol six in the section on accelerators it says for information
 on how to specify translation tables see vol four this is so you
 know what to put for the xmnaccelerator resource  if you go to
 vol four it says likewise if a modifier is specified there is
 nothing to prohibit other modifiers from being present as well for
 example the translation
 	shiftq	quit
 will take effect even if the ctrl key is held down at the same time as
 the shift key and the q key
 
 this is true for accelerators and mnemonics which are implemented using
 event handlers instead of grabs it is not true for menu accelerators  if
 you are a motif implementor i would suggest lobbying to get the xlib semantics
 changed to support the feature i described above  otherwise change the
 documentation for menu accelerators to properly set the users
 expectations because menu accelerators are not the same thing as
 translations
 
 is it possible to supply  one accelerator for a menu entry
 
 if you mean menu accelerator no it is not possible  that is according to
 the definition of the xmnaccelerator resource in the xmlabel manual page
 
 keep in mind when answering this question that when using motif you
 cannot use xtinstallaccelerators
 
 i cannot think of a reason why not
 
 how can you ensure that accelerators work the same independent of
 case  what i want is ctrlo and ctrlo to both be accelerators on one
 menu entry

i find this thread on motif accelerators absoultly amazing  if i were
writing an interface to keyboard accelerators i would have one
resource called accelerators that took a translation table period
i would also implement it so that programmer never has to do any work
to get the accelerators installed  as soon as the enduser specified
one it would be active and automatically installed

to get multiple accelerators on a single menu item i would do something like

	menuitemaccelerators override n
		ctrlm	fire n
		shiftl	fire n

the accelerators would work exactly like translations and you would
automatically see a ctrl m show up in your menuitem object

why in the world is the motif stuff so complicated with so many different
special cases depending on what type of widget you are dealing with  there
has to be some reason

sorry for the political tone of this message

should we sell weapons to all sides or just the losing one then

ending an embargo does not we must sell anything at all

if the europeans want to sell weapons to one or both sides they are welcome
as far as i am concerned

you seem to oppose ending the embargo  you know it is difficult for europeans
to sell weapons when there is an embargo in place

i do not automatically accept the argument that bosnia is any worse than
other recent civil wars say vietnam for instance  the difference is it is
happening to white people inside europe with lots of tv coverage

a new youth movementenviroleague was recently born according to its
founder boyd r critz iii cis id seventyone thousand six hundred and eleventhree hundred and sixtyfive of peoria illinois
enviroleague exists for the education of youth both male and female in
matters concerning their values related to and responsibility for our
environment
 
incorporated as an illinois notforprofit corporation its articles and
initial applications for a service mark have now been filed  according to
critz its draft bylaws contain the following statement of mission and
objectives
 
                           mission
 
   it is the mission of enviroleague and its adult members
   to foster and implement the improved education of young
   people in the need to conduct their lives as stewards
   of the earth to leave the earth in a better condition
   than they found it and to otherwise act as responsible
   moral and ethical users of their environment  to pursue
   the accomplishment of this mission enviroleague shall
   seek to serve as a catalyst focusing in common because the
   separate efforts of all groups desiring the preservation
   improvement and responsible use of the environment in
   which we must all live
 
                         objectives
 
   in pursuit of the mission of enviroleague its primary
   objectives shall be
       one  to establish a movement involving as many
            environmentally concerned organizations as
            possible said movement having as its primary
            focus the education and participatory
            involvement of young people in appropriate areas
            of environmental concern
       two  to develop and provide to such organizations and
            their branches a full complement of program
            materials for their use including suitable
            uniforms insignia and other badges written
            ideas syllabi and information literature and
            other items as shall seem appropriate and
            desirable
       three  to serve as a clearing house for the exchange
            of program ideas materials and information
            among said organizations  and
       four  to assist environmentally concerned
            organizations to recruit and train the necessary
            adult leadership for their youth programs
 
enviroleague will operate through three program divisions serving youth in
the elementary middle and high school grades respectively  service shall be
through formation of enviroleague teams either by enviroleague itself or by
environmentally conscious organizations or their local branches wishing a
charter to use programs developed by enviroleague
 
enviroleague as it develops will be controlled by the actual adult leaders
of each local team and will have no nationally imposed obstacles to
membership or adult leadership status not based upon relevant improper
conduct organizations accepting a charter may however impose certain
additional standards for their own use of the program material  should such
organizations do so enviroleague will commit itself to forming as soon as
possible new nearby teams having no such restrictions particularly as to
youth membership
 
enviroleague will operate on the principle that youth will have much to
contribute to developing its programs  thus the top youth leaders of its
teams for middle and high school youth may become involved in governing any
local administrative groups and those for its high school youth may be
involved in similar functions at the national level
 
program materials are in development at this time  copies of the draft
portions of the mentors manual manual for adult leadership will be in the
earth forum library seventeen these files will be updated as development takes
place
 
compuserve is particularly proud that enviroleagues founder chose this
electronic medium to make the first public announcement of its formation
this announcement is being made simultaneously in both the outdoor and earth
forums
 
the electronic home of enviroleague is in compuserves earth forum  go

subsequently enviroleagues initial governance council has held its first
meeting  boyd critz was elected as the first enviroleague chief guardian
equivalent to chairman of the board or ceo  he can be reached at home

of course one again faces the question of how one circumscribes government
power and keeps it circumscribed in a complex society when it is in the 
interest of neither capitalists nor consumers to refrain from using 
government power for their own ends  but apart from that little 
conundrum
 
	without having a complete answer to this question  i should think
it obvious that the first step should be to convince people this would be
a desirable result  there are still quite a lot of people who feel that
the command economies of eastern europe failed due to corruption rather than
essential weaknesses of caommand economies  and you still have a majority
in this nation that favors keeping unenforced and unenforcible laws on
the books in order to send a signal


it would seem that a society with a failed government would be an ideal
setting for libertarian ideals to be implemented  now why do you suppose
that never seems to occur


i fail to see why you should feel this way in the first place  constant
combat is not particularly conducive to intellectual theorizing  also
they tend to get invaded before they can come to anything like a stable
society anyway 


regulation is such a vauge word  
 
i would not call it vague  i would call it elastic  all regulation is 
not necessarily the same  by opposing all government regulation some 
libertarians treat every system from a command economy to those that
regulate relatively free markets as identical  that is one reason
many of the rest of us find their analysis to be simplistic 
 

umm is there any distinction between vague and elastic in this
context aside from one having a more positive connotation than the other

at any rate  we have been through all this before

      the ungodly shall perish                            psalm onesix
 
  
i am extremely uncomfortable with this way of phrasing it  gods love 
is unconditional unqualified unfathomable  we are capable of 
rejecting gods love but he never fails to love us

these verses do not show that gods love is qualified but rather that he 
is opposed to evil

i am uncomfortable with the tract in general because there seems to be 
an innappropriate emphasis on hell  god deserves our love and worship 
because of who he is  i do not like the idea of frightening people into 
accepting christ  

i see evangelism as combining a way of living that shows gods love with 
putting into words and explaining that love  preaching the gospel 
without living the gospel is no better than being a noisy gong or a 
clanging cymbal

here is a question  how many of you are christians because you are 
afraid of going to hell  how many are responding to gods love

how do we know that they were gang members and not undercover cops
or even lawabiding menacing minorities  by the way  why the sneer quotes

we know because the area that the gun shopshooting range is in is right on
the border of the west side of chicago  that is a gang infested area

so  kratz was there  does that mean that he is a gang member

even in the most ganginfested areas most of the residents are not
gangmembers

that only minorities have gangs  not so  as far as the quotes are concerned
it was totally obvious that they were not just practicing for marksmanship

how was it obvious  were they not trying to hit the target  or does
kratz confuse marksmanship with trying to simulate a post  if so
that excludes selfdefense shooting but the rest of us understand
that that exclusion would be an error  it excludes a lot of legit
gun games as well

do not know about you but i have never seen anyone else practice marksmanship by
taking their gun out of their coat as fast as possible and start shooting

sounds like practical pistol or maybe ipsc  it also sounds like how a
selfdefense shooter might well practice  the only things that action
excludes are hunting and like a post shooting  kratz should get out
more often

so why do i read in the papers that the qumram texts had different

reading newspapers to learn about this kind of stuff is not the best idea in
the world  newspaper reporters are notoriously ignorant on the subject of
religion and are prone to exaggeration in the interests of having a real
story that is a bigger headline

let us back up to one thousand nine hundred and thirtyfive  at this point we have the masoretic text the
various targums translationscommentaries in aramaic etc and the
septuagint the ancient greek translation  the masoretic text is the
standard jewish text and essentially does not vary  in some places it has
obvious corruptions all of which are copied faithfully from copy to copy
these passages in the past were interpreted by reference to the targums and
to the septuagint

now the septuagint differs from the masoretic text in two particulars
first it includes additional texts and second in some passages there are

the various corrupted passages  it must be emphasized that to the best of

have little theological import

isaiah and fragments of various sizes of almost all other ot books  there
is also an abundance of other material but as far as i know there is no
sign there of any hebrew antecdent to the apocrypha the extra texts in the
septuagint  as far as analysis has proceeded there are also variations
between the dss texts and the masoretic versions  these tend to reflect the
septuagint where the latter is not obviously in error  again though the
differences thus far are not significant theologically  there is this big
expectation that there are great theological surprises lurking in the
material but so far this has not happened

the dss are important because there is almost no textual tradition in the

in article  arensisiedu yigal arens writes

at issue was not a trial behind closed doors but arrest trial and
imprisonment in complete secrecy  this was appraently attempted in the
case of vanunu and failed  it has happened before and there is reason
to believe it still goes on

the lengthy article you quote does not imply this  it only states that
it is somehow possible not that it is in any way likely  this is akin
to an article saying that it is possible that the usaf has several
captured ufos without supporting the liklihood of such an assertion

read this
from maariv february eighteen possibly twentyeight one thousand nine hundred and ninetytwo
publication ban

by baruch meiri

all those involved in this matter politely refused my request one way
or another look the subject is too delicate  if i comment on it i
will be implicitly admitting that it is true if i mention a specific
case even hint at it i might be guilty of making public something
which may legally not be published

in other words they were telling a pesky reporter to keep guessing

israel maintains this same attitude about nuclear weapons it may or
may not have  the us maintains the same attitude about the presence
of nuclear weapons on specific naval craft  by refusing to
acknowledge the existence of such weapons on specific ships us
warships have i believe become unwelcome in new zealand which has
declared itself a nuclearfreezone  

the state of israel has never officially admitted that for many years
there have been in its prisons israeli citizens who were sentenced to
long prison terms without either the fact of their arrest or the
crimes of which they were accused ever being made public more
precisely a court ordered publication ban was placed on the fact of
their arrest and later on their imprisonment

the usaf has never officially admitted to having any ufos either

in israel of one thousand nine hundred and ninetythree citizens are imprisoned without us the citizens of
this country knowing anything about it  not knowing anything about
the fact that one person or another were tried and thrown in prison
for security offenses in complete secrecy

this is stated as a fact without supporting evidence  it would have
been more convincing if your reporter had come up with just one name
of someone who is sitting in jail lost to the world as he suggests
maybe elvis or jfk somebody  

let us put it this way if israel has put people away without
publicizing their arrests or the legal proceedings against them how
has their disappearance been explained  people have relatives
friends and colleagues you know  israel is not known as a place
where people are made to vanish  would you care to give us a list of
people whose whereabouts are unknown  people who are presumed to be
imprisoned  this whole conspiracy story is not something that we have
come to associate with yigal arens before  perhaps from now on we
should

another way to figure out the difference between the user window position

positions you just have to use xquerytree and remember that the window manager
decorations window is the parent of your window unfortunately you can only

i have posted two new postings on the net since i discovered how to use it
and both times i received redicule for predicting the red sox as high as
third in the al east  id like to hear why it is people do not think the sox
can be as high as third this year  here are some of my observations

well had you been a bit less exuberant in both the tone and substance of
your predictions the responses would probably have been a bit more
measured be that as it may

one roger and frank are in vintage form and the sox are rresponding to them
clemens is always in this form and viola is not really performing beyond
what might reasonably have been expected how do you know that the sox are
responding to them and not to al bumbry hobson or my most likely
suspect new hitting coach mike easler i certainly am more likely to give
easler credit for mo vaughhns hot start than clemens or viola

two greenwell is hitting as he did before his injuries
this was the optimistic scenario but not unreasonably so he has not shown
much power yet though

three dawson is providing the leadership and some hitting they need from him
how can you tell that dawson is providing the leadership perhaps it is
calderon perhaps it is clemens and viola maybe hobson is finally showing
those people skills he was supposed to have when they hired him or maybe
it is all a myth and dawson has been hitting reasonably well but not as
well as greenwell vaughn cooper or fletcher

four russell is finishing well
in three games why do not we look at this one again in say july

five fletcher is hitting well as a leadoff hitter
a bit better than could reasonably have been expected but do not forget that
zupcic looked like wade boggs lite for about seventyfive abs last year beware of
small sample sizes still if fletcher hits as well as he did last year he would
be a great improvement over any sox leadoff hitter from last year be aware
that his career numbers seem to indicate that he puts up good numbers as
long as he does not have to make more than three hundred ab or so in a year

six cooper is hitting well i think he will be better then boggs in the field
and just as good at the plate
ummmsorry no i can buy the in the field part and i think he will be
better at the plate than the one thousand nine hundred and ninetytwo boggs but in general cooper while he will
be a pretty good hitter could not carry boggs jockstrap with a little
luck he could be the fourth or fifth best threeb in the al martinez boggs
ventura and palmer will all be better

if the sox pitch like last year they have a better pitchiong staff now
and hit like they are so far they coiuld run away with thee division but
since i think that their hitting and pitching may not be up to the challenge
of running away with the division i think that they win be over five hundred and at
least third if not second or first

see here is where you make that quick left turn off into the aether five hundred
is plausible third is not unlikely but phrases like could run away with
the division are likely to get you a visit from the men in the white
coats it is not really clear that their staff is better than last year if
russell does well darwin does not go on the dl and hesketh does not pitch
just barely well enough to avoid losing his spot in the rotation they could
be better on the other hand if hesketh pitches miserably and they are too
stupid to move him to the pen and bring up conroy or somebody fossas
continues to pitch dismally but they keep giving him innings becasue he is a
lefty and russell explodes they could be pretty bad

 one do not use big capacitors  they are unreliable for timing due to
 leakage 
 
 instead use a quartz crystal and divide its frequency by two forty times
 or something like that
 
 one mhz divided by twoforty  one cycle per two weeks approximately
 
 two i would not expect any components other than batteries or electrolytic
 capacitors to fail at forty c or forty f for that matter either  
 the battery is going to be your big problem  also of course your
 circuit should not depend on exact values of resistors which a crystal
 controlled timer will not
 

 would not a crystal be affected by cold my gut feeling is that as a
mechanically resonating device extreme cold is likely to affect the
compliance terminology of the quartz and hence its resonant frequency

  israeli soldiers have sexually taunted arab women in the occupied gaza strip 
  during the threeweeklong closure that has sealed palestinians off from the 
  jewish state palestinian sources said on sunday
  
  the incidents occurred in the town of khan younis and involved soldiers of
  the golani brigade who have been at the centre of housetohouse raids for
  palestinian activists during the closure which was imposed on the strip and
  occupied west bank
  
  five days ago girls at the alkhansaa secondary said a group of naked
  soldiers taunted them yelling come and kiss me when the girls fled 
  the soldiers threw empty bottles at them
      
  on saturday a group of soldiers opened their shirts and pulled down their
  pants when they saw girls from alkhansaa walking home from school parents 
  are considering keeping their daughters home from the allgirls school
      
  the same day soldiers harassed two passing schoolgirls after a youth
  escaped from them at a boys secondary school deputy principal srur 
  abujamea said they shouted abusive language at the girls backed them 
  against a wall and put their arms around them
  
  when teacher hamdan abuhajras intervened the soldiers kicked him and beat
  him with the butts of their rifles
  
  on tuesday troops stopped a car driven by abdel azzim qdieh a practising
  moslem and demanded he kiss his female passenger qdieh refused the 
  soldiers hit him and the eighteenyearold passenger kissed him to stop the 
  beating
  
  on friday soldiers entered the home of zamno abuealyan sixty blindfolded
  him and his wife put a music tape on a recorder and demanded they dance as
  the elderly couple danced the soldiers slipped away the coupled continued
  dancing until their grandson came in and asked what was happening
  
      the army said it was checking the reports
  
                 
  
  
       israeli troops bar christians from jerusalem
  
  israeli troops prevented christian arabs from entering jerusalem on thursday 
  to celebrate the traditional mass of the last supper
      
  two arab priests from the greek orthodox church led some thirty worshippers in
  prayer at a checkpoint separating the occupied west bank from jerusalem after
  soldiers told them only people with armyissued permits could enter
  
      right now our brothers are celebrating mass in the church of the holy
  sepulchre and we were hoping to be able to join them in prayer said father
  george makhlouf of the ramallah parish
  
      israel sealed off the occupied lands two weeks ago after a spate of
  palestinian attacks against jews the closure cut off arabs in the west bank
  and gaza strip from jerusalem their economic spiritual and cultural centre
  
     father nicola akel said christians did not want to suffer the humiliation
  of requesting permits to reach holy sites
  
      makhlouf said the closure was discriminatory allowing jews free movement
  to take part in recent passover celebrations while restricting christian
  celebrations
  
      yesterday we saw the jews celebrate passover without any interruption
  but we cannot reach our holiest sites he said
  
      an israeli officer interrupted makhloufs speech demanding to see his
  identity card before ordering the crowd to leave

heartily recommend it to all proisrael types for the following 
reasons

one  it is an excellent absorber of excrement  i use it to line
    the bottom of my parakeets  cage  a negative side effect is
    that my bird now has a somewhat warped view of the mideast

two  it makes a great april fools joke ie give it to someone
    who knows nothing about the middle east and then say april
    fools

anyway i plan to call them up every month just to keep getting

subject god morality and massacres
lines two hundred and fiftyeight

a listmember d andrew killie i think wrote in response to the
suggestion that genocide may sometimes be the will of god

  any god who works that way is indescribably evil
  and unworthy of my worship or faith

nobuya higgy higashiyama replied as in substance did others

  where is your source of moral standards by which you judge gods
  behavior

it is often argued that we have no standing by which to judge gods
actions  who is the clay to talk back to the potter but we find a
contrary view in scripture when god proposes to destroy the city of
sodom genesis eighteen abraham says

  suppose that there are some good men in the city
  will you destroy the righteous along with the wicked
  far be it from you lord to do such a thing
  shall not the judge of all the earth do right

i am told that the hebrew is actually a bit stronger than this and
can perhaps be better rendered dynamic equivalence as

  shame on you lord if you do such a thing

there are those who say that the definition of good is whatever
god happens to want but if that is so then the statement that god
is good has no meaning  it simply says that god does what he wants
that being the case no one can either love or obey god because he
is good the only motive left for obeying him is that he is
powerful just as it makes sense to obey a dictator even when he
tells you to round up all jews and exterminate them because if you
defy him you might end up in the gas chamber yourself so it makes
sense to obey god because he has the power to punish you if you
do not this ethical theory i take to be in radical contradiction to
genesis eighteen and to christianity in general

any theory that makes our moral judgements worthless makes any
further discussion of morality or of the goodness of god
meaningless however it does not follow that our moral judgements
are always infallible in particular cases still less our judgements
in particular cases about the course of action most likely to
achieve a good result

when i read the scriptural accounts of the actions of god in
history those actions often seem to me very different from what i
might expect of a god who loves us and desires what is best for us
moreover leaving the scriptures aside and considering the natural
world i find that nature is often very different from what i might
expect if it were the work of a benevolent deity  origen said
those who believe that the author of nature is also the author of
the scriptures must expect to find in the scriptures the same sort
of difficulties that they find in nature

now that some such difficulties should exist is not in itself an
argument against the existence power wisdom and goodness of god
on the contrary their absence would be such an argument suppose
that i am watching bobby fisher play chess and suppose that every
time he makes a move i find myself nodding and saying good move
just what i was expecting him to do  same move i would have made if
i were playing that would be a sign that fisher is no better a
chess player than myself given that he is better i expect that at
least some of his moves will have me thinking now what do suppose
induced him to do that or even boy that was a real slip  he is
just thrown the game away similarly if god understands the
workings of the universe better than i do it is to be expected that
sometimes it will look to me as if he has made a mistake

one difference between fisher at the chessboard and god at the
controls of the universe is that i can see the end of the chess
game if fisher wins i revise my earlier inference that it was
carelessness that made him lose his queen twentythree moves earlier
however if he loses and particularly if i can see that there was a
time when he had an opportunity for a checkmate in two moves and did
not take it then i know that he is not as good a player as i had
thought

with god on the other hand i shall not in this life see the total
result of some of his actions therefore my grounds for judging
that i have seen a bad move on his part must always be far shakier
than my grounds for making a similar judgement about fisher

                         

in the book of genesis we read that josephs ten older brothers
who with good reason found  him insufferable conspired to sell
him into slavery in egypt there he eventually became viceroy and
when there was a famine in canaan he was able to provide for his
family when his brothers nervously apologized he told them do
not worry you meant to do me evil but god turned it into good

i once heard a rabbi speak on this text he said

        the history of the jews is largely a history of events
   that look like catastrophes that threaten the continued
   survival of the religion or the people or both but
   amazingly those events turn out to be the saving of the jews
   and of judaism
        the sale of joseph by his brothers looked like the breakup
   of the family  but in fact it ended with a reconciliation of
   the quarrel between them the famine that drove the family out
   of canaan looked like a misfortune for them  but in fact if
   they had stayed in canaan they would almost certainly have
   intermarried with the canaanites and been assimilated into
   their culture  their oppression by the egyptians a few
   generations after their arrival in egypt again looked like a
   disaster but god used it to bring them out of egypt and into
   the promised land
        here the people built a temple and regularly offered
   sacrifices but the babylonians captured jerusalem and judea
   destroyed temple and city and countryside and deported most of
   the people to babylon you might have thought that that would
   be the end of the people and the religion but it was not
   living in canaan the people had been under constant danger of
   assimilation  again and again they had turned from the
   worship of the lord to the worship of the canaanite fertility
   cults with their ritual prostitution and ritual human
   sacrifice the babylonian captivity put a stop to that never
   again did the jews show any interest in polytheism or idolatry
   neither the worship of the canaanites mor that of the
   babylonians ever again had a foothold among them
        nor is that all judaism had been in danger of becoming
   simply a system of sacrifices and temple observances the only
   prescribed acts of worship consisted of coming to jerusalem
   every so often and offering a sacrifice during the captivity
   with the temple gone the jews invented the synagogue a place
   of meeting for reading and study and discussion of the
   scriptures they came to realize clearly what they were in
   danger of forgetting while they continued to live in judea
   that god is not simply a local or tribal deity not just the
   controller of the land of canaan or the patron of the jewish
   people but the creator of the world and the ruler and judge
   of all humans everywhere
        time passed and the babylonian empire was replaced by
   that of the persians and then that of the greeks or rather
   the macedonians the ruler antiochus epiphanes was determined
   to stamp out judaism and to this end he made the reading and
   the study of the torah punishable by death again one might
   think that this would be the end of judaism but it was not
   the people met for worship and instead of reading the torah
   portion appointed for the day they would read some passage
   from the prophets that had a similar theme and then discuss
   that  before this time the torah the socalled five books of
   moses genesis exodus leviticus numbers and deuteronomy
   were the only books read and studied in the synagogue  if it
   had not been for antiochus the books of the prophets would
   probably have been forgotten altogether his hatred for judaism
   saved them

        other examples here omitted for brevitys sake

        some of you may remember that julie andrews first became
   famous as eliza doolittle in the stage production of my fair
   lady when warner brothers undertook to make a movie of it
   everyone expected that julie who had been so magnificent on
   stage would play the same role in the movie instead the
   studio decided to go with an established screen star and cast
   audrey hepburn  julie andrews was naturally crushed but she
   later realized that if she had played the screen role she
   would have been typecast for life as an elize doolittle type
   it would have been a disaster for her as it was walt disney
   offered her the role of mary poppins and she won an oscar for
   it  at the presentation she stood there smiling and looking
   at walt disney she said and now my special thanks to the
   man who made all this possible  jack warner it was the most
   memorable line of the evening
        in a similar spirit we jews might thank the men who in
   the providence of god have preserved judaism and kept it alive
   to this day beginning with josephs brothers and continuing
   with two pharaohs with nebuchadnezzar with antiochus
   epiphanes

after the formal meeting had broken up one woman came up to him
privately and said you were talking about the holocaust were not
you he answered if that is an example that came to your mind
then you are right i was talking about it to you but i would not
talk about it to everyone for not everyone can bear it i assume
that he meant that without the holocaust there would have been no
state of israel

someone hearing the rabbis lecture might leap to the conclusion
that god is dependent on the wickedness of men to accomplish his
purposes  or at least that the rabbi thought so he might then  go
on to suppose that the wickedness is in fact gods doing  that he
stirred up josephs brothers to a murderous hate against him and
that when the israelites were in egypt god hardened pharaohs
heart so that he oppressed the people and would not let them go
and this raises questions about how an action can be considered
wicked and at the same time be considered something that god has
brought about

i suggest another way of looking at it consider a sculptor who has
a log of wood from which he proposes to carve a statue but the log
instead of having a smooth even grain throughout has a large knot
that spoils the appearance of the surface the sculptor considers
the wood for a while and then carves a statue that features the
knot that makes that particular interruption in the grain and color
of the wood correspond to some feature of the statue so that
observers will say how fortunate the sculptor was in finding a
piece of wood with a knot like that in just the right place its
presence is the crowning touch the thing that makes the statue a
great work of art in reality the knot far from being what the sculptor was
looking for was a challenge to his skill if the wood had not
contained that flaw he would still have made a great work of art
but a different one so if josephs brothers had not sold him god
would still have brought about his purposes for the jewish people
but he would have done so in another manner if judas had not
betrayed jesus if caiaphas and his fellow leaders had not rejected
jesus but had rather acknowledged him as the annointed of god if
pilate had followed his conscience rather than his fears and had set
jesus free it might appear that there would have been no
crucifixion and therefore no redemption and therefore no
salvation not so god did not need judas sin to redeem us if
judas had done right then god in christ would still have reconciled
the world to himself  we do not know how just as we do not know
how michelangelo would have painted the sistine chapel if its
interior had instead been shaped like grand central station and
just as we do not know how bobby fisher would have won his fourth
game agianst spassky if spassky had refused the exchange of bishops
and had attacked fishers knight instead do not bother to look up
the game in questioni am making up this example but the point is
none the less valid

thus we may say both one that god used say the cowardice of
pilate to accomplish his purposes and two that the said cowardice
was not gods doing and that pilate would not have thwarted gods
plans by behaving justly and courageously

what then are we to make of the place where god says to moses i
will harden pharaohs heart so that he will not let the people go
some christians have taken this to mean that pharaoh was a puppet
with god pulling the strings and that his stubbornness and cruelty
were not his own work but the work of god in him i suppose rather
that what god was telling moses was something like this if you see
that pharaoh is not willing to let the people go do not be
discouraged or suppose that the situation is out of my control my
purposes will not be thwarted if pharaoh chooses to hear you and
let the people go well and good if he does not i will fit his
resistance into my plans and fit it so perfectly that future
historians and theologians will suppose that i would have been
thrown for a loss if pharaoh had obeyed me

to return to the question that started this all off is it possible
that the serbs in slaughtering the moslems of bosnia are
instruments of gods will
     first point what they are doing is wrong just as what
josephs brothers did was wrong just as what judas did was wrong
they intend it for evil if god somehow brings good out of it that
does not make them any less subject to just condemnation and
punishment
     second point of course god will bring good out of it but not
the same good that he would have brought if the serbians had
refrained from the sins of robbery and rape and murder nor does the
good he purposes excuse us from the duty of doing what is right

attn those who live inthe philadelphia metro area

back in september i was listening to wip and i remember the morning
guys were talking with mayor ed rendell  the topic of conversation
was a new ball park for the phillies  the location for this new park
was suggested to be near thirtyth st station  at the time the mayor was
optimisitic that in the future this could become a reality  has
there been any new news on this subject or is it still a pipe dream
i know the city of philadelphia has other projects ahead such as the
new convention center and the upcoming spectrum ii  but it would be
nice to see this a reality  it is planned that the phillies leave
the vet and leave it solely to the eagles and if that is the case
the eagles should make the vet a grass stadium but that is another
story  i want to see that day

     religion especially christianity is nothing more than a drug    
     some people use drugs as an escape from reality  christians inject
     themselves with jeezus and live with that high                    
                                                                         
    your logic is falty  if christianity is a drug and once we die we  
    die then why would you be reluctant to embrase this drug so that    
    while you are alive you enjoy yourself                              
                                                                         

pardon the harshness that follows

once i told a cradle christian please do not take advantage of jesus
or anybody for the sake of your own selfish realization or search
for true faithreligionbelongingbeing infear of hellvanityetc  
instead of serving yourself we must be serving him  
until you have comprehended this truth you are only doing things for your 
own egoism

let us not use jesus our religion the bible anything or
anybody as a means of escape or getting ecstatic or high
we are gods children and we must have a true and authentic
relationship with our father with obedience faith hope and 
love and works the last as the most important

beware of our materialistic worldly and selfish motives  
atheists have this ground against us and i believe they are right about

the article also contains numbers on the number of sexual partners
the median number of sexual partners for all men twentythirtynine was seventhree
compared to the table i have already posted from masters johnson
and kolodny showing male homosexual partners it is apparent that
homosexual men are dramatically more promiscuous than the general
male population  it is a shame that we do not have a breakdown for
straight men vs gaybi men  that would show even more dramatically
how much more promiscuous gaybi men are


is not is funny how someone who seems to know nothing about homosexuality
uses a very flawed imho source of information to pass jusgement on all
homosexual and bisexual men

only the most comprehensive survey on sexuality in fifty years

  it would seem more logical to say that since
the heterosexual group of men is larger then the chances of promiscuity
larger as well  in my opinion orientation has nothing to do with it


chance and size have nothing in common on the multimillion number scale we are 
talking about


men are men and they all like sex  i am a gay male  i have had sex three
times in my life all with the same man  before that i was a virgin

so whose promiscuous


nobody said that you were  chill

just because someone is gay does not mean they have no morals  just because
someone is heterosexual does not mean they do  look at the world

well said

statistics alone prove that most criminals are by default hetero


actually the kinsley report in one thousand nine hundred and fortysevenor fortyeight used a high percentage of

 secret ceremony involving a bull  he stands naked in a pit covered
 with some sort of scaffolding while assistants coax a bull to stand on
 the scaffolding  they then fatally stab the bull which douses the
 worshipper in the pit with blood  this is supposedly some sort of
 rite of passage for members of the bull cult  i wonder if this is
 related to the mithras cult
 
 i do not know where rutherford got his information for this chapter
 the book is historical fiction and most of the general events which
 take place are largely based on historical accounts
 
 there is a rite like this described in joseph campbells
 occidentalmythology  he also described levels of initiation i think
 six  i do not know where campbell got his info but i remember thinking he
 was being a little eclectic
 
 i also wonder what if any connection there is between the ancient bull

i have not seen much info about how to add an extra internal disk to a
mac we would like to try it and i wonder if someone had some good
advice

we have a mac iicx with the original internal quantum fortymb hard disk
and an unusable floppy drive we also have a new spare connor fortymb
disk which we would like to use the idea is to replace the broken
floppy drive with the new hard disk but there seems to be some
problems

the internal scsi cable and power cable inside the cx has only
connectors for one single hard disk drive

if i made a ribbon cable and a power cable with three connectors each
one for motherboard one for each of the two disks would it work

is the iicx able to supply the extra power to the extra disk

what about terminators i suppose that i should remove the resistor
packs from the disk that is closest to the motherboard but leave them
installed in the other disk

the scsi id jumpers should also be changed so that the new disk gets
id one the old one should have id zero

it is no problem for us to remove the floppy drive as we have an
external floppy that we can use if it will not boot of the hard disk

 happen if you took off but someone saw you and you were caught

ghods do you have any idea how much trouble you would get into for
taking off like that leaving the scene of an auto accident is bad
enough killing someone  leaving is ten times worse who is going

does anyone really believe the swiss have had no war within their borders
because every adult male owns a rifle i am a great admirer of the swiss but
five hundred years of peace on their turf has zilch to do with gun ownership can you
picture hitler with panzers and fockewulfs poised on the border losing
sleep over a few thousand expert rifleman 

not just because of the riflemen  they also have many hard bunkers in
the mountains that would be nearly impossible to penetrate as for
tanks they would be rather useless in such mountainous terrain  

hitler stayed out of switzerland because the swiss run the money in this
world 

gee that is a new one  he thought it was a different ethnic group  
since hitler was determined to control at the least all of europe
do you think he gave a damn about international monetary concerns  
also there is a lot of gold in swiss vaults  do not you think he new
that  if he could have he would have taken switzerland  however
crazy as he was he was not totally stupid  it would have cost him a
hell of a lot to take switzerland with no guarantee that an invasion
would be successful  he probably figured or his generals did when
he was listening to them that it was not worth the cost

 	i realize i am entering this discussion rather late but i do
 have one question was not it a reagan appointee james watt a
 pentacostal christian i think who was the secretary of the interior
 who saw no problem with deforestation since we were living in the
 last days and ours would be the last generation to see the redwoods
 anyway
 
 i heard the same thing but without confirmation that he actually said it
 it was just as alarming to us as to you the bible says that nobody knows
 when the second coming will take place
 
  
   michael a covington

i do recall watt making a comment to this effect though it was quite a few
years back and i cannot cite the specifics  i also recall that cecil andrus who
was secretary of the interior during the carter administration responded
to watts comments by pointing out the stewardship role that god gave
to man as recorded in genesis  which makes me wonder who are the
true conservatives  it seems to me that a conservative should want to
conserve things of value for longterm societal benefit  this form of
conservation should logically extend to the physical environment in 
which people live as well as the moral environment in which they relate
to one another and to god

imho watts stewardship status is not enhanced by the fact that he served 
on the board of directors for jim bakkers organization during a time in 
which bakker committed criminal acts which eventually landed bakker 
in federal prison

i have been saying this for quite some time but being absent from the

the royals will set the record for fewest runs scored by an al
team since the inception of the dh rule  ps any ideas what this is

they will fall easily short of six hundred runs that is for damn sure  i cannot
believe these media fools picking them to win the division like our
tom gage of the detroit news claiming herk robinson is some kind of
genius for the tradesaquisitions he is made

     would you say the same thing about the dodgers in sixtyfive or sixtysix  true
cone is probably as good as drysdale and they have no koufax but still
these teams were winning with home run leaders who had very bad totals with
lots of lowscoring games etc  and they did not use relievers whereas
jeff montgomery is having a super season for them
     that being said i still picked them fiveth or so but i think a superb
pitching team can win if they have enough hitting  there is more of a
chance of that i think than of a team with tremendous hitting but no
pitching  at least to me
     i wonder though  which one do you people think would do better  a team
with johnson koufax in his prime seaver carlton and young in no real
order as the starters with sutter fingers and lyle in the bullpen but
with a puny offense assuming good defense like mazeroski maranville etc
or a team with poor pitching but with an offense of cobb carew ruth gehrig
mays schmidt wagner and bench  againyou pick the order
     i would postulate that the pitching one would be several games better by
seasons end  even the best hitters can succeed only twofive of the time in
their best years but a great pitcher can throw lots of shutouts  taking all
the players in their prime they might throw fifty shutouts in a year  and all
the offense would have to do is get one run across

dear folks

i am still awaiting for some sensible answer and comment

it is a fact that the inhabitants of gaza are not entitled to a normal
civlized life they habe been kept under occupation by israel since one thousand nine hundred and sixtyseven
without civil and political rights 

it is a fact that gazans live in their own country palestine gaza is
not a foriegn country nor is telaviv jaffa askalon beersheba foreign
country for gazans all these places are occupied as far as palestinians
are concerned and as far as common sense has it 

it is a fact that zionists deny gazans equal rights as israeli citizens
and the right to determine by themsevles their government when zionists
will begin to consider gazans as human beings who deserve the same
rights as themselves there will be hope for peace not before

somebody mentioned that gaza is foreign country and therefore israel
is entitled to close its borders to gaza in this case gaza should be
entitled to reciprocate and deny israeli civilians and military personnel
to enter the area as the relation is not symmetrical but that of a master
and slave the label foreign country is inaccurate and misleading

to close off seven hundredzero people in the strip deny them means of subsistence
and means of defending themselves is a collective punishment and a
crime it is neither justifiable nor legal it just reflects the abyss 
to which israeli society has degraded 

i would like to ask any of those who heap foul langauge on me to explain
why israel denies gazans who were born and brought up in jaffa to return
and live there  would they be allowed to if they converted to judaism 
is their right to live in their former town depdendent upon their
religion or ethnic origin  please give an honest answer

a couple of years ago i put together a tesla circuit which

primary windings it also used two power transistors in a to three

ten years ago i built a onezerozero volt tesla and the thing was very
spectacular but besides scaringamazing friends depending on their
knowledge of science and generating strong emi i never found anything
useful that could be done with it   is there any realworld application
for tesla coils today 

david prutchi

first of all realize that tesla invented ac power generators motors
transformers conductors etc technically all transformers are tesla
coils  in general though when someone refers to a tesla coil they mean
an air core resonant transformer the tv flyback version tesla
coil see the encyclopediaofelectroniccircuits vthree one hundred and sixone for
diagram has not an air core it is of a class of circuit called
oscillating shuttle circuit osc generally oscs are highly
efficient but this version uses transistors and resistors
which are very lossy devices typically tesla used active
reactances instead of passive resistors so that he could achieve
efficiencies of ninetyninefive and better the usual application of an aircore
resonant transformer or of an osc is to produce strong emi
for wireless broadcasts how well do you think your computer
screen would work if we removed the hf hv tesla flyback coil
from it if we were to remove from our homes and industries all
tesla coils our lights would go dark our cars would sputter
and die our radios would go silent our industries would grind
to a halt and we would have to go back to using coal for heat
gas for lamps horses for transportation steam for power and
telegraph for communication is that real world enough for you

get the message we would not have oneone hundred the convieniences we have
today if not for tesla give credit where credit is due

the walks should give it away  obps in general somewhat more valuable than

in slugging

i am no sdcn but what is more valuable

twentyeight hits wfive more doubles twelve more hrs   or
seven more triples and fiftytwo bbs  let us not forget the thirtynine extra sbs how many cs

alomar had nine cs  baerga had two

do not forget the fiftynine more outs baerga had his gidp balances out his cs and
he had one more sacrifice than alomar   a replacement level second baseman
could have had seventeen hits five walks and a couple of xbh for the additional
outs baerga had  a triple is little different than a home run  we are talking
exchanging almost sixty walks for six or seven home runs and four doubles  i 
would say the almostsixty walks are more valuable

also alomar got a far greater boost from his home park than baerga did from 
his and six or seven home runs hmm

so if you wanted to pick a second baseman to play in toronto you would take 
alomar anywhere else and you would probably take baerga

they felt were silly sounding projects from a wishlist of potential 
projects prepared by the us mayors conference before the stimulus package
was ever proposed  the document in question was designed to pressure the
white house to increase the size of the block grant proposal submitted
to congress  it did not work

the twofiftysix billion proposed in the stimulus package came nowhere close
to covering the total estimated cost of the original wishlist  if it
were passed communities would have to select which projects to fund and
at what level

in the case of spokane wa tom foleys home district no one ever
expected to be able to refurbish a local swimming pool one of the 
republicans examples from the funds available in the stimulus
package since the estimated cost of doing so exceeded the total 
amount of block grant funds the city would receive from the stimulus 
package for all projects  

the plan instead was to use the money on public housing construction
and remodeling to cope with a severe housing shortage  yup there are
places where that is true  the swimming pool improvements were near the
bottom of a long list of priorities prepared by the city  the three million
or so to be received would cover only a few of the most pressing
priorities

if the block grants are cut from the stimulus package it is these projects
that will be affected by the lack of funds  and that is why the clinton
administration has been publicizing the issue

a final point  one may or may not like community block grants  it is
worth noting however that congressional republicans opposition to them
is new  since the nixon administration republicans have generally 
supported such grants as an alternative to targeted federal spending
arguing that local governments are far better able to determine spending
priorities than washington bureaucrats  

is it clear now  or is this all too complicated to understand

 people who started it by a noknock search with concussion grenades are hardly

well looking at the videos it seems that this fire started in various

there is dis
crepancy even among charismatic organizations as to the proper use
of tongues  be it revelatory with interpretation for prayer use
or for signifying believers which i doubt since any one can do it
pentecostals assembly of god church of christ seem to espouse all
three  neopentecostals tend to view prayer use and as a sign as the
uses  speaking in tongues during a service is not usually done by
neopentecostals because for the most part they still attend protestant
churches  nondenominational churches seem to view the use as a sign
as merely optional but recommended

koberg

	just a couple of minor corrections here

	one  the churches of christ do not usually believe in speaking in
tongues in fact many of them are known for being strongly opposed to
pentecostal teaching  you are probably thinking of church of god in
christ the largest africanamerican pentecostal denomination

	two  i am not sure what you mean by signifying believers  but it
should be pointed out that the assemblies of god does not now nor has it
ever held that speaking in tongues is the sign that one is a christian 
the doctrine that traditional pentecostals including the ag maintain is
that speaking in tongues is the sign of a second experience after becoming
a christian in which one is baptized in the holy spirit  that may be
what you were referring to but i point this out because pentecostals are
frequently labeled as believing that you have to speak in tongues in order
to be a christian  such a position is only held by some groups and not the
majority of pentecostals   many pentecostals will quote the passage in
mark sixteen about these signs following them that believe but they generally
do not interpret this as meaning if you do not pactice the signs you are not
saved

	three  i know it is hard to summarize the beliefs of a movement that
has such diversity but i think you have made some pretty big
generalizations here  do neopentecostals only believe in tongues as a
sign and tongues as prayer but not tongues as revelatory with a message 
i have never heard of that before  in fact i would have characterized them
as believing the same as pentecostals except less likely to see tongues as
a sign of spirit baptism  also while neopentecostals may not be
inclined to speak in tongues in the nonpentecostal churches they attend
they do have their own meetings and in many cases a whole church will be
charismatic

the people who post to this particular newsgroup are either too cowardly
too arrogant or too apathetic to discuss this issue since i have yet to
see any discussion grace my computer screen  while it holds particular
interest to the africanamerican community everyone has something to gain
from discussing it  as any knowledgable person should know christianity
has been used in this country to tighten the spiritual emotional  mental
hold slavery placed on the minds souls  hearts of africanamericans 
this was most effectively done by the display of white icons of jesus in
slave churches to encourage the godly superiority of slaveowners  it
was not enough that the slaveowner was your provider but he was also your
god to be looked upon with unconditional love  loyalty and to be
worshipped with great pride  but how culturally  biblically accurate are
these icons  pictures  statues of a black jesus have been found in
european countries as that of a black madonna  but what about biblical
physical descriptions of jesus his hair being compared to that of wool
his feet to that of brass  and think about the area of the world where all
biblical actions took place  i welcome all intelligent commentary on this
important topic flamers need not reply

sherlette 

ps  i expect at least this type of response  it does not matter what
color his skin was his actions  what he did for mankind are what counts
 this is true i am not questioning this  but he walked the earth for three
decades as a human this part of his existence intrigues me  and as for
saying that it does not matter  to a member of a physically emancipated
people who is still struggling for mental emancipation believe me  it
matters

the general attack on the members of this group seems unjustified
there has been discussion of this issue in the past  we cannot discuss
everything at once so the fact that some specific thing has not been
discussed recently should not be taken as a sign of general cowardice
arrogance or apathy  in past discussions no one has been outraged by
suggestions that jesus could be black and it has been suggested by a
few scholars but the concensus is that he was most likely semitic
as you probably know there is a tradition that portrayals of jesus in
art tends to show him as one of the people  thus you would not be
surprised to find african art showing him as black and oriental art
showing him as oriental  there are good reasons relating to christian
devotion to think of him in such a way  it is also good now and then
to have that image challenged and to think of jesus as being a member
of xxx where xxx is the group you least respect  clh

     freemasonry is one of the allies of the devil page iv 
 
     the issue here is not moderate or conservative the issue is god
and the devil page vi 
 
     it is worthwhile to remember that the formulators of public 
school education in america were freemasons page twentynine 
 
     jesus christ never commanded toleration as a motive for his 
disciples and toleration is the antithesis of the christian message
page thirty 
 
     the central dynamic of the freemason drive for world unity 
through fraternity liberty and equality is toleration this is seen 
in the writings of the great writers of freemasonry page thirtyone 
 
     he jesus christ established the most sectarian of all possible 
faiths page thirtyseven 
 
     for narrowness and sectarianism there is no equal to the lord 
jesus christ page forty 
 
     what seems so right in the interest of toleration and its 
cousinsliberty equality and fraternityis actually one of the 
subtlest lies of the father of lies page forty 
 
     the southern baptist convention has many churches which were 
founded in the lodge and which have corner stones dedicated by the 
lodge each of these churches should hold public ceremonies of 
repentance and of praying the blood and the name of the lord jesus 
christ over the church and renouncing the oaths taken at the 
dedication of the church andor building page fiftythreefiftyfour

what is wrong with the above observation is that it explicitly gives the
impression and you may not in fact hold this view that the common perhaps
even the correct approach for a scientist to follow is to sit around
having flights of fancy and scheming on the basis of his jealousies and
petty hatreds

flights of fancy and other irrational approaches are common  the crucial
thing is not to sit around just having fantasies they are not of any use
unless they make you do some experiments  i have known a lot of scientists
whose fantasies lead them on to creative work usually they will not admit
out loud what the fantasy was prior to the consumption of a few beers

simple example warren jelinek noticed an extremely heavy band on a dna
electrophoresis gel of human alu fragments  he got very excited hoping that
he would seen some essential part of the control mechanism for eukaryotic
genes  this fantasy led him to sequence samples of the band and carry out
binding assays  the result was a wellconserved four hundred or so bp sequence
that occurs about five hundredzero times in the human genome  unfortunately for
warrens fantasy it turns out to be a transposon that is present in
so many copies because it replicates itself and copies itself back into
the genome  on the other hand the characteristics of transposons were
much elucidated the necessity of a cellular reverse transcriptase was
recognized and the standard method of recognizing human dna was created
other species have different sets of transposons  fortunately for me
warren and i used to eat dinner at tgi fridays all the time

it further at least implicitly advances the position that
sciences goes forward and it is not clear what this means given the
context in which it occurs by generating in a completely nonrational
and even random way a plethora of hypotheses and theories that are then
weeded out via the critical function of science

i am not sure that it is random  but there is no known rational mechanism
for generating a rich set of interesting hypotheses  if you are really
working in an unknown area it is unlikely that you will have much sense
of what might or might not be true under those circumstances the best
thing to do is just follow whatever instincts you have  if they are wrong
you will find out soon enough but at least you will find out something
if you try to do experiments at random with no prior conceptions at all
in mind you will probably get nowhere

though why this critical
function should be less subject to the nonrational forces is a mystery

unfortunately the critical function does sometimes become hostage to
nonrational forces  then we get varieties of pathological science
lysenko mirskys opposition to dnaasgene cold fusion and so forth

if experimental design hypotheses creation and theory construction are
subject to jealousies and petty hatreds then this must be equally true
of the application of any critical function concerning replication
this is what leads one ala feyerabend to an anything goes view

i do not agree that this follows  in fact this is exactly the point at
which i disagree with feyerabend  it is a most important part of the
culture of science that one keeps ones jealousies out of the refereeing
process  failures there are aplenty but on the whole things work out

another point there are a couple of senses of the phrase experimental
design  i would say that the less rational part is in experimental choice
not design  alexander fleming proc royal soc one thousand nine hundred and twentytwo chose to look for
bacteriophage in his own mucus for strange reasons phage had previously
been found in locust diarrhea fleming probably thought runny bottom runny
nose what the hell it is worth a try but his method of looking for phage
was welldesigned to detect anything phagelike in fact he found lysozyme

true the generation part can be totally irrational  but typically it is
not  anecdotes concerning instances where a hypothesis seems to have
resulted in some way from a dream or from ones political views simply
do not generalize well to the actual history of science

it is not clear to me what you mean by rational vs irrational  perhaps
you can give a few examples of surprising experiments that were tried out
for perfectly rational reasons or interesting new theories that were first
advanced from logical grounds  the main examples i can think of are from
modern highenergy physics which is not typical of science as a whole

what does it take to play on a ws winning club

we have no way of knowing because we cannot separate morris contribu
tion  from the rest of the teams  there is only one way of determin
ing best in baseball  and that is by looking at the  scoreboard  at
the  end  of  the game  each game determines which team is the best
that day  at the end of the season the team that was  the  best  the
most  often  is  the best in the division  the playoffs determine the
best of the best  but the point is that the only decision making pro
cess  used to determine the best is the score of the game and it re
lates to the teams  not the individual players  there is no method
inherent  in  baseball of comparing individual performances  and that
is how it should be because after all baseball is a team game

to say that one player is better than another is to be able to say ab
solutely  that  player as team would have played better with player b
in their lineup  sheer speculation  impossible to ascertain

if you want to select a group of statistics and claim that clemens has
done  better  with those statistics as a criteria then fine  but you
have  to  be  able  to  prove  that  those  statistics   measure   the
individuals  contribution  to  winning  the ws  because  that is the
only measure of best that has any meaning in the  context  of  base
ball   so  until you can prove that clemens contributes to a ws cham
pionship more than morris your evaluation of  clemens is totally  sub
jective  and  is  mere opinion  i have yet to see that any of you can
predict a ws winner with any greater accuracy than jeanne dixon

the fact is that morris did not win any ballgames toronto did in
spite of morris contribution   this has been explained to you

exactly  the jays won with morris pitching   and  boston  wins  with
clemens pitching  i am not saying that morris is better than clemens
i am saying that individual comparisons between  players  are  totally
meaningless  and  that anyone claiming that clemens is better based on
his era has missed the point of what baseball is all about

many many times and you are either too stupid or too stubborn to grasp it

you do not have to be rude

you are completely consumed by the post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy

for you to say that means that you have either missed the entire point
of  my  argument or you yourself have committed a fallacy  ignoratio
elenchi  i am not saying that morris is better than clemens   because
he   has  more   rings   although  i  have  tongue in cheek claimed
that in the past  i am saying that it is impossible to  isolate   an
individuals  performance   from that of his teams for the purpose of
comparing that individuals performance with another individuals per
formance

the stats are a nice hobby and  that is  about  it  there  is  no  new
knowledge being produced  so when a poster claims that morris is better
than clemens because he has more rings the poster is no more nor less 
incorrect than the rest of you baying hounds

lines one hundred and twentythree


i am quite astonished shocked and appalled at this serious frontal 
assault on emerging american freedoms  the clinton administration 
nor any other government agency has any legitimate role whatsoever 
in regulating cryptography to do so is tantamount to regulating 
acceptable speech and is blatantly unconstitutional perhaps we 
should rename this year one thousand nine hundred and eightyfour in honor of such an illustrious 
proposal  let the crappy chip live in infamy and the adminstration
receive great shame and discredit for this bizarre misadventure

i am outraged that my tax money is being used to develop technology
to restrict my freedoms far beyond reasonable measures  the yous
government will have my full uncooperation and disobedience on any
serious threat to my liberties such as this and i call on everyone
with an interest in a sensible government to resist and defy this 
proposal  the administration does not seem to understand that they
are merely a subservient instrument to implement the will of the
public and hence anyone involved in this proposal in this respect is 
wholly negligent and remiss in performing their lawful duty

while encryption
technology can help americans protect business secrets and the
unauthorized release of personal information it also can be used
by terrorists drug dealers and other criminals

it seems to me that yous diplomatic communications should be 
tappable by the youn whenever any countries produce a warrant to
the youn  in fact i think we should stop paying the nsa billions
of dollars a year to produce unbreakable codes for this reason
these actions violate the sovereignity of international law i hope
mr clinton is shrewd enough to recognize my sarcasm and satire here
but if he is not it is a modest and reasonable proposal so he should
find merit with it nevertheless

cryptography is neutral technology if everybody has strong 
cryptography including policemen bureacrats businessmen 
housewives thugs and hoodlums we have a sustainable 
equilibrium  anything less is an unworkable antiegaltarian 
arrangement intrinsically antithetical to american freedoms and
guaranteed to collapse under its own weight of inherent 
impracticality we do not need to compromise on issues of freedom

for too long there has been little or no dialogue between our
private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the
tension between economic vitality and the real challenges of
protecting americans

for too long our government has demonstrated itself to be 
increasingly hostile and a serious obstacle to economic vitality 
and protecting americans

since encryption technology will play an increasingly important
role in that infrastructure the federal government must act
quickly to develop consistent comprehensive policies regarding
its use  the administration is committed to policies that
protect all americans right to privacy while also protecting
them from those who break the law

it is not possible for the federal government
to act quickly or develop consistent comprehensive
policies period  and even if by some grandiose miracle such
a thing were possible it would only be an efficient way to
deprive american citizens of fundamental and inalienable rights

the administration has to be committed to leaving private 
industries alone esp on this issue  the government has no 
legitimate role in regulating the content of communications
law enforcement agencies must be prepared to forfeit their
surveillance bludgeon they are soon and inevitably to be 
disarmed of it 

q   if the administration were unable to find a technological
     solution like the one proposed would the administration be
     willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more
     powerful encryption devices

no such laws can be constitutionally sound and this is equivalent
to a veiled threat which i do not appreciate  this kind of 
extortion tends to agitate me and others into radicalism i will
trade threats for threats and violation for violation

     the administration is not saying since encryption
     threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement
     we will prohibit it outright as some countries have
     effectively done

if the administration did say this it would find itself 
impeached for reckless and outrageous disregard of essential
established entrenched and explicit constitutional privacy 
guarantees the administration would have no legal standing 
whatsoever such an action would be egregiously illegal and
criminal and wholly untolerated and disregarded by vast 
segments of the population

     nor is the yous saying that every
     american as a matter of right is entitled to an
     unbreakable commercial encryption product 

the yous comprised of a vast majority of people fanatically 
committed to preserving their privacy in the face of an 
increasingly totalitarian government is saying just that  
take your chips and give them to nsa employees as christmas bonuses
we can run any algorithm on our computers we damn well please 
and we will make any chips we please and we will send any bit 
pattern over our data highways we please and if you try to stop 
us you will be gradually or abruptly dissolved into nothingness

privacy vs law enforcement
     there is a
     false tension created in the assessment that this issue is
     an eitheror proposition 

this is an outright dingaling denning lie  the two aims of
privacy and surveillance are intrinsically and fundamentally 
incompatible and you have to work for the nsa to think otherwise 
americans are about to discover ways through the use of technology 
to preserve their inalienable but forgotten freedoms that have slowly 
been eroded away by an increasingly distant and unresponsive and 
unrepresentative government

   this is turning into what is a moonbase good for and i ought not
   to post when i have a hundred some odd posts to go but i would
   think that the real reason to have a moon base is economic
   
   since someone with space industry will presumeably have a much
   larger gnp than they would without space industry eventually
   they will simply be able to afford more stuff

   if i read you right you are saying in essence that with a larger
   economy nations will have more discretionary funds to waste on a
   lunar facility that was certainly partially the case with apollo
   but real lunar colonies will probably require a continuing
   military scientific or commercial reason for being rather than
   just a we have the money why not approach

ah but the whole point is that money spent on a lunar base is not
wasted on the moon it is not like they would be using one thousand one thousandr bills
to fuel their moondozers the money to fund a lunar base would be
spent in the country to which the base belonged it is a way of funding
hightech research just like darpa was a good excuse to fund various
fields of research under the pretense that it was crucial to the
defense of the country or like esprit is a good excuse for the ec to
fund research under the pretense that it is good for paneuropean
cooperation

now maybe you think that governmentfunded research is a waste of
money in fact i am pretty sure you do but it does count as
investment spending which does boost the economy and just look at
the size of that multiplier

does anyone have any idea about the size of waco  i am just curious because
if it were a small town that may have something to do with it  possibly not
it sure did not take it very long to burn down though  i was watching abc and
it only took like a little over thirty minutes to burn down

	waco is a city of about one hundredzero people  the population temporarily
   raised to about one hundred and twozero people when all the feds and state police officers
   arrived

	i tell you what i stayed in a hotel room about four miles from the bd
   compound around three weeks ago  i have never felt more paranoid in my whole
   life  there were at least one hundred state police in the hotel






the claim we had the water turned off so the fire engines had to bring
their own does not hold up  if they had cut off the water they surely
could have turned it back on just as quickly  they just did not want to
there were some scores to settle  message to anybody else is very clear
do not fuck with us  we will do you in

not that i am one to believe that everything that the government tells us is
true but if that was the message they wanted to send why did they wait fiftyone days
i think the message would be better sent by charging in there right away  not
waiting for fiftyone days and pounding them with sound etc

a bunch of dead bd members are not going to be so able to tell their
side of the story so now all we have is the story according to the batf
and fbi  also mr care about the rights of people clinton or his
administration approved this action fbi said washington had approved
it  they fbi said the gas masks used by the bds have a finite life
and were close to running out  why could not they have just waited

well there are nine people supposedly alive  they can tell their story  as far
as bill clinton is concerned do not you think he has more pressing matters to
attend to besides some small group of people in texas  how about bosnia  now
there is a problem    why could not they have waited  they waited too long
as it is  something should have been done earlier


they gov is trying to say it was a mass suicide  in the past they had
expressed this was a real possibility but now they decided it was not
a possibility so they could go on with the raid  apparantly what they
feel korash was or was not capable of or going to do was driven by
what was most convenient at the time

now this means that

one the public and media will forget about all this  having become weary of
it

this has already happened for many people

two there will be no investigation independent or otherwise or a whitewash

very much a possibility

three there will be no unsealing of the warrant and related documents
four what anybody will know about this incident will be the batf version

with the way our government is i would not doubt it

five the batf has just been given carte blanche for further abuses with
   the effective support and approval of the administration

clinton said on the news that he knew about what was happening but that it was
all in the hands of the fbi  that is if you choose to believe the media

six there will be more abuses with no concern of administration censure
seven the precident has been established that the feds can kill in quantity
   to achieve their aims  especially if the target is excercising their
   rights under the second amendment and the rest of the bill of rights
   and is a governmentdeclared unnice fellow

if they had rocket launchers and such as the press and gov claims why
should not they have done something  what possible use would a religious cult
have for a rocket launcher  also is child abuse covered by the bill of
rights

  lls and clams will be pleased  dung tsow pingsp will be pleased
   saddam husseinsp will be pleased  idi amin would be pleased  stalin
   would be pleased  even hitler would be pleased  any selfrespecting
   despot would nod and say well done bill clinton

well then there are probably a lot of selfrespecting despots in the us because
i am sure they feel the same way

god bless america  land of the free  past tense

well maybe i am overreacting  but i see on the tv as i am typing where

maybe maybe not  there are a lot of questions that should be raised about
this incident  the problem is who will do it and be heard

govt spoksewoman the new attorney general known to be almost rabid
about private ownership of guns  wants to ban assault guns and just
about everything else is saying the fbi had amazing restraint then
falls back into the official goverenment line about how the bd were
guity of child abuse and were into it in an ongoing basis and so on
note that according to the liberal elite giving a child a spanking is
regarded as child abuse seriously  if it gets known the state can
take your child away from you if you spank your kid  she also is saying

which state is that  the federal government  or an individual state government


clinton personally approved this operation  she told him it was
appropriate and so on and he said ok do it  somehow i am not
surprised  the people must know who is boss  who is in charge
and it is obviouly no longer the people

it seems to me that the people have not been in charge for a long time  if they
really were i do not think the government would be doing as many things as it
has in the past

and i maintain the appropriate response as far as this raid by batf is
concerned regarding child abuse is so what  batf are not our child
protective services police  yet  after all the bd had been tried on
that charge before and found not guilty  the govt people have pretty
much gone silent on the terrible illegal guns bd supposedly has and
stress the continued child abuse apparantly to make it a seem as sort
of a rescue operation figuring everyone hates child abusers and
anything is ok to use against them  occasional references to ammunition
possesed by the bds and so on is irrelevant it is not illegal to have
ammunition yet

true but is it illegal to have a rocket launcher

am i having a vain hope that an honest investigation will occur on this
thing  or will it simply be whitewashed under the rug and business
as usual will continue to be the order of the day in the new order
who will be given the official title of thought police i wonder

and if clinton and friends have their way highly likely at this point
the new order government will also have all the guns  so what if
one thousand nine hundred and eightyfour is going to be ten years late  i think we are going to discover
that we will be paying dearly for putting this fellow in office for decades
to come  even some diehard supporters are having serious doubts about
their savior

shit if people do not get what they want right away there is an instant problem
clinton has only been in office for a few months  give him a chance to get
something done  the guy had a lot of shit thrown in his lap in the beginning
give him a chance to work on things a little  as they say  rome was not built
in a day

yes i am upset  i see no good as far as civilindividual rights to
come of any of his proposalsdecisions for the last month or so
we have really been had  or bill of rights is now nothing but a quaint
curiosity

i highly doubt that it is that bad yet  how about the rodney king trial  the

 lots of stuff about the nicene creed deleted which can be read in the

  take mr weiss to task on using mormon doctrine to declare the difinitive
  word on what the lds church teaches as doctrine  hopefully the lds 
  netters will be amiable in their explanation

since it would do no good to rebut what mr weiss has stated on the origin
of the nicene creed and its status as devine and inspired i say no good
because it cannot be proved through discussion or debate as to whether or not 
the authors of the creed were inspired i leave you it will be some time 
before i post again with the following thought authored by eugene england 
professor of english at brigham young university  mr england wrote the 
following as part of a book review section in this peoples magazine spring 
one thousand nine hundred and ninetythree edition

  i conclude with a little sermon because i believe we will not be a mormon
  or humanfamily until we can get over labeling and rejecting each other 
  with terms like feminist or patriarchal liberal or conservative christian 
  or nonchristian  hal eight  when we are tempted to draw a circle around
  a set of beliefs and traditions and styles and call it american then exclude
  those who do not fit it may be well to consider that perhaps the most central
  defining characteristic of a good american might be one who does not draw
  exclusive circles  that the surest way of excluding ourselves from the 
  central american ideal is by excluding others  and when we are tempted to
  draw a circle around mormon or christian to decide who is orthodox
  and who is not by how much they agree with us it might be well to consider
  that the central pillar of christs orthodoxy is our ability to love
  unconditionally those who are different and include them in our family

  i recently spent some time in a christian bookstore in california the
  service was excellent the clerks and customers all smiling neat and
  wellscrubbed and there were the expected wholesome offerings of scriptural
  commentaries sentimental fiction and collections of evangelistic sermons
  but i was dismayed to find how much shelf space was given to attacking 
  others often viciouslywhether the political left our modern american
  culture or other religions  a whole section was devoted to cults and the
  occult and as you might expect mormonism was right there under the same
  rubric and indictment often by the same authors as satanism  and i found
  i could either rent or buy in english or spanish copies of the god makers
  that absurdly inaccurate even libelous but very popular and dangerous
  antimormon film that uses exaclty the same techniques and even accusations
  of the nazi films that scapegoated jews in the one thousand nine hundred and thirtys

  it seems to me one major indication that a person is a genuine convert to
  christ and his redemptive love is his lack of paranoia and anxiety perfect
  love casteth out fear i john foureighteen  i have always been pleased that the
  lds church has not engaged in attacks on other faiths though i find a 
  disheartening increase in willingness of individual mormons to engage in the
  same kinds of stereotyping and scapegoatingand even threats of coercive
  actionas the religious right wing has launched this year against the
  political left and american cultural and religious styles they do not like
  it is a fearful irony that in so doing mormons take common because with the
  very people who have most slanderously attacked mormonspeople who would
  if they had power forcefully restrict mormons rights along with those of
  others they believe to be evil


the above sermon was addressed to the lds audience who usually subscribe
to this peoples magazine but would certainly apply to all of us who
rely on the mercies and grace of jesus christ to bring us back into his
arms  

even though the lds church claims devine authority to exercise the principles 
of the restored gospelas in the days of christ the church does not claim 
perfection and infallibility in how those with authoritative status have or do 
now lead the church  i for one do not wish to be labelled christian if 
those who profess themselves as christians attack my beliefs because they are 
intollerent for example of the way my religion may interpret biblical 
scriptures of the same source to have a different meaning and implication 
than mainstream christianity would give it  once again being in the 
majority does not in and of itself prove anything except that your collective 
voice is louder  that is really all the critics of the lds church have to stand
on in terms of the kind of biblical interpretation used as proof to counter 
the lds church interpretation  using someone elses biased research of truths 
and nontruths whose to say what the mixture is as an authoritative tool to 
disprove or discredit is not being fair to anyone least of all themselves 
let us simply agree to disagree and share beliefs through adult discussion 
and conversation thereby uplifting everyone

not at all two weeks ago i registered a concern about some programming
that was being conducted by a student organisation here at the
university of texas at san antonio  as a result i was interrogated
by the capus police who also attempted to create a positiveidentification
file photo fingerprints etc i refused to permit this and filed a
complaint with the university administration  the vicepresident for
business affairs the boss of the campus police stated that he had no
interest in the legalconstitutional implications of those actions

subject need help with video detection circuit
organization systemsnsoftware
lines fiftyfive



i am trying to build a circuit that detects the presence of video vs
a blank screen by monitoring the rg and b outputs of a graphics
card  it should be able to detect the presence of a single pixel at
sixtyfive mhz which would mean detecting a fifteen ns pulse  it should also be
able to tell the difference between a blank screen about three hundred mv
and a dim screen say around three hundred and ten mv  oh yes it also needs to be
cheap  

my first circuit was a dismal failure  i used three compariators each
compariator had the  input going to one of the guns the  input
went to a reference created by a voltage dividera potentiometer

the first problem was that the compariator was way too slow i
needed to get several pixels in a row before it would fire the
compariators so i could have a whole screen full of text but my
circuit would not detect it   

the second problem is that there was more noise on the reference then
the smallest difference between a blank screen and a dim screen  in
fact the difference between completely black and completely white is
only six hundred and fifty mv  i am wondering if i am going to have to amplify the
video signals to make this work  

there are faster compariators but they are expensive and require 
split supplies   i would need to replace my fortynine quad compariator
with three oneeightynine compariators and create a whole new power supply
circuit  

at this point i think what i need is some sort of transistor
circuit  transistors are fast and cheap and should do the trick

unfortunately i am way out of my league when it comes to designing
transistor circuits so i am appealing to the net for help  any
ideas tips circuits pointers references etc would be greatly
appreciated  

oh yes i only sample the output of this thing every second or so so
i do not need a fast response time at all however i have not found a
way to take advantage of that fact

thanks a lot for any help anybody might be able to give of course
you will have my undying gratitude

subject re question about virgin mary
organization city university of new york

faris says
afaris
i think you are talking about the assumption of the blessed virgin
mary  it says that the immaculate mother of god the ever virgin
mary having completed the course of her earthly life was assumed
body and soul into heavenly glory  this was defined by a papal
statement in one thousand nine hundred and fifty though it had certainly been believed by some
before that  like the immaculate conception this is primarily a
roman catholic doctrine and like it it has no direct biblical
support  note that catholics do not believe in sola scriptura
that is they do not believe that the bible is the only source of
christian knowledge  thus the fact that a doctrine has little
biblical support is not necessarily significant to them  they believe
that truth can be passed on through traditions of the church and also
that it can be revealed to the church  i am not interested in yet
another catholicprotestant argument but if any catholics can tell us
the basis for these beliefs i think it would be appropriate  clh

that is generally accuate but contains one serious error  we catholics
do believe that gods revealed truth that is not explicitly recorded in
the bible can be and is passed on through the tradition of the church
it should be noted that the tradition of the church otherwise known as
sacred tradition is not the same as ordinary human traditions
however we do not believe that additional truth will be revealed to
the church  public revelation which is the basis of catholic doctrine
ended with the death of st john the last apostle  nothing new can
be added  theologians study this revelation and can draw out implications
that were not recognized previously so that the council of nicea could
define statements about the theology of the trinity and the incarnation
that were not explicitly stated in the bible and had been disputed
before the council but there was no new revelation at nicea or at
any subsequent council

cardinal newmans an essay on the development of christian doctrine
written while he was still an anglican is an excellent discussion of
of this point  it was recently reprinted as a doubleday image books
paperback with some related shorter works under the title conscience
consensus and the development of doctrine

the problem is that specter was one of the key government attorneys several

 what are the current products available to upgrade the resolution
 which ones support postscript
 
 any experiences with them either good or bad
 
 is the quality difference really noticable
 
 i am planning on producing camera ready copy of homes  will the higher
 resolution be noticed for these
 
if you are talking about laser jet four then i believe it has to be postscript
i do not see any advantage to using pcl when you have a peice of hardware
plugged into the ljfour that is doing the work and it can support any language
that is suited for the job  besides i do not think pcl is even capable of
handling one thousand two hundred dpi specifications  i only have experience with the laser
master winjet one thousand two hundred which brings the ljfour up to one thousand two hundred dpi and it uses postscript
it also has a fast print mode which is not postscript and it is at a lower
resolution six hundreddpi i think but it is fast  this particular product
uses your host processor to process the postscript so even with a decent
pc you know it is going to be slow ie slow compared to a highend workstation
processed ps

the quality difference is very noticable and is almost worth the wait for
the ps processing  i am rather impatient

we were using it for bw camera images rsone hundred and seventy  the gray scale image was
accepted by ms word and handed to the winjet ps printer driver which converts
the image into postscript and then hands it off to the winjets postscript
processor  the postscript is rendered into ram lots of it and when it
is done it shoots it directly to the printer  the ps processor can also
accept ps files created from other sources including dos applications but
windows has to be running at the time of printing  the ps processor is
responsible for the halftoning and i would say it does a pretty good job  our
camera images came out very good in my opinion  not as good as laser masters
demo though

i do not know how many other similar products are out there but i would be
surprised if there are several

          in case you didnot know palestineans were there for eighteen months 
          and they are coming back
          when you agree to give palestineans their humanrights
 
          afterall human rights arenot negotiable
 
       correct me if i am wrong but is not the right to ones life also
       a human right or does it only apply to palestinians
 
      no it is everybodys right however when a killer kills then he is giving
      up willingly or unwillingly  his lifes right to the society 
      the society represented by the goverment would exercise its duty by 
      depriving the killer off his lifes right
 
     so then it is all right for israel to kill the people who kill israelis
     the old eye for an eye thinking funny i thought modern legal systems
     were made to counter exactly that
 
    so what do you expect me to tell you to tell you master of wsidom 
 							       
 
 if you insist on giving me namestitles i did not ask for you could at
 least spell them correctly sigh

that was only to confuse you ha ha ha hey 

    when you are intentionally neglecting the most important fact that 
    the whole israeli presence in the occupied territories is illegitimate 
    and hence all their actions their courts their laws are illegitimate on 
    the ground of occupied territories
 
 no i am not neglecting that i am merely asking you whether the existance
 of israeli citicens in the wb or in gaza invalidates those individuals right
	        are you trying to retaliate and confuse me here
 to live a as you so eloquently put it human right we can get back to the 
 question of which law should be used in the territories later also you have 
 not adressed my question if the israelis also have human rights


first my above statement doesnot say that the existence of israeli citizens
in the wb revoke their right of life but it says the israeli occupation
of the wb revoke the right of life for somemost its citizens  basically
revokes the right of for its military men clearly occupation is an
undeclared war during war attacks against military targets are fully legitimate 

secondly surely israeli have human rights but they ask their goverment to
protect it by withdrawing from the occupied terretories not by further oppressing
palestinean human rights


    what do you expect me to tell you master of wisdom when i did explain my
    point in the post that you responded to the point is that since israel 
    is occupying then it is automatically depriving itself from some of its rights 
    to the occupied palestineans which is exactly similar the automatic 
    deprivation of a killer from his right of life to the society
 
 if a state can deprive all it is citizens of human rights by its actions then 
 tell me why any human living today should have any rights at all


because not all states are like israel as oppressive as ignorant or as tyrant


      what kind of rights and how much would be deprived is another issue
      the answer is to be found in a certain system such as international law
      us law israeli law 
    deleted jonas was throwing upnot for real so you can stick to the screen
      it seems that the us law represented by us state dept in this case
      is looking to the other way around when violence occurs in occupied territories
      anyway as for hamas then obviously they turned to the islamic system
 
     and which system do you propose we use to solve the me problem
 
    the question is not which system would solve the me problem why  because
    any system can solve it 
    the laws of minister sharon says kick palestineans out of here all palestine 
 
 i asked for which system should be used that will preserve human rights for 
   
 all people involved i assumed that was obvious but i will not repeat that 
 mistake now that i have straightened that out i am eagerly awaiting your 
 reply

so you agree that that an israeli solution wouldnot preserve human rights
i am understanding this from your first statement in this paragraph

    joseph weitz administrator responsible for jewish colonization 
    said it best when writing in his diary in one thousand nine hundred and forty
 	   between ourselves it must be clear that there is no room for both
 	   peoples together in this country we shall not achieve our goal
 						                  
 	   of being an independent people with the arabs in this small country
 	   the only solution is a palestine at least western palestine west of
 	   the jordan river without arabs and there is no other way than
 	   to transfer the arabs from here to the neighbouring countries to
 	   transfer all of them not one village not one tribe should be 
 	   left only after this transfer will the country be able to
 	   absorb the millions of our own brethren there is no other way out

 just a question if we are to disregard the rather obvious references to 
 getting israel out of me one way or the other in both plo covenant and hamas
 charter that is the english translations if you have other information i would
 be interested to have you translate it why should we give any credence to 
 a private paper even older i am not going to get into the question if he
 wrote the above but it is fairly obvious all parties in the conflict have
 their share of fanatics guess what those are not the people that will
 make any lasting peace in the region more deleted stuff

exactly you are right i guess that the problem is that the israeli goverment 
is full with  men like joseph weitz 


    we and our either refers to zionists or jews i donot know which 
 
    well i can give you an answer you master of wisdom i will not suggest the 
    imperialist israeli system for solving the me problem 
 
    i think that is fair enough 
 
 no that is not an answer since i asked for a system that could solve 
 the problem you said any could be used then you provided a contradiction

above you wrote that you understood what i meant underlined by   
any system can be used to solve the conflict  but not any system would 
resolve it justly

 guess where that takes your logic to nevernever land 

you are proving yourself as a   first you understood what i meant but then
you claim you didnot so to claim a contradiction in my logic too bad for you 
the master of wisdom


    the greatest problem of zionism is arab children
 			   rabbi shoham
 
 oh and by the way let me add that these cute quotes you put at the end are
 a real bummer when i try giving your posts any credit

why do you feel ashamed by things and facts that you believe in  if you were a
zionists if you believe in zionist codes and acts well i feel sorry for you
because the same rabbi shoham had said yes zionism is racism
if you feel ashamed and bothered by the zionist codes then drop zionism
if you are not zionist why are you bothered then you should join me in
condemning these racist zionist codes and acts

 ports of motif to both three hundred and eightysixbsd and linux are available for a fee of about
 one hundred  this is cost recovery for the person who bought the rights to

 pertaining to motif has been high
 
 
 i just wonder if this will also because a divergence between commercial
 and noncommercial software ie you will only get free software using
 athena or openlook widget sets and only get commercial software using
 the motif widget sets  
 
 
 i cannot see why  if just about every workstation will come with motif
 by default and you can buy it for under one hundred for the free unix
 platforms i cannot see this causing major problems

  let me add another of my concerns yes i can buy a port of motif for cheap
but i cannot get the source for cheap hence i am limited to using whatever x
libraries the motif port was compiled against at least with older versions of
motif i have been told that motif onetwo can be used with any x but i have not
seen it myself

  currently i have xelevenrfive running on eight different unix platforms of which
only three came with motif on those three i am unable to use the xelevenrfive
libraries to build motif clients because i get link errors between the
vendorsupplied port of motif and my xelevenrfive i anticipate having this same
problem when xelevenrsix becomes available

  the result is that i cannot build motif clients that rely on xelevenrfive since i do
not have motif compiled under xelevenrfive true i could buy another port of motif
but that sort of ruins the whole idea of free does not it

                  vancouver british columbia  


nineforty am pst
	     
	     
	     folks we are about to start the background briefing 
on the aid package

	     senior administration official  good morning  the 
president  president clinton and president yeltsin agreed 
yesterday on a series of american initiatives to support economic 
and political reform in russia and it is valued at onesix billion  

	     before taking your questions and running through the 
basic outlines of this package i want to make a few points  
first this is the maximum that the clinton administration can do 
with available funds to support russian reform  all of the funds 
have been allocated and appropriated by the congress  there is 
no need for the administration to go back to the congress to fund 
any of these programs  all our fiscal year ninetythree funds currently 
are available so in effect all of these programs can begin 
tomorrow
	     
	     the second point is that this package is designed to 
support russian reformers  all of the initiatives in the package 
are directed at reformers and for their benefit and all have 
been worked out with prior consultation with the russian 
government
	     
	     third the president is determined that we will 
deliver on these commitments this year  the package is designed 
to maximize our ability to support reform  in designing it we 
wanted to avoid making commitments that we could not meet and we 
feel very confident that we can meet all of these commitments in 
front of you
	     
	     fourth i would like to note the special importance of 
trade and investment  i think it is fair to say that russias 
capital and technology needs throughout the next decade extend 
well into the hundreds of billions of dollars  no collection of 
governments can meet those needs only the private sector can do 
so  and so the president and president yeltsin agreed to make 
trade and investment a major priority in the relationship  
	     
	     they also agreed that there would be a new joint 
commission on energy and space formed headed on the yous side by 
vice president gore on the russian side by prime minister 
chernomyrdin  and the goal of this effort is to break through 
the barriers to trade and investment on both sides and to promote 
a vastly expanded relationship
	     
	     if it would be helpful i would be prepared to run down 
the first page which is a summary of yous assistance and just 
give you some general background on what these programs are  
i will do it quickly and then i will be glad to take questions
	     
	     the first group of initiatives are humanitarian food 
and medical assistance  this is part of our effort which has 
been underway for several years to provide basic humanitarian 
grant food assistance so that the russian government can assure 
there is at least a minimal amount of bread on the shelves in the 
major cities  that is one hundred and ninetyfour million in grant  that is from food 
for progress the grant portion of food for progress  we will also 
be continuing our grant assistance in medicines and 
pharmaceutical supplies and that is thirty million
	     
	     the second item is concessional food sales  as you 
know the united states has had a longterm grain relationship 
with russia  it is important to us and it is important to russia 
that we continue that relationship  the president has chosen the 
food for progress program which is a concessional loan program  
the value over the next seven months is seven hundred million  these are 
concessional terms  the exact terms have not been worked out 
but i think it is fair to say there will be a grace period on 
principal of six or seven years and concessional rates 
thereafter for the life of the deal
	     
	     the third program is a collection of private sector 
support  we think this is one of the most important things we are 
going to do  privatization and the creation of small businesses 
is the number one priority of the reform government in moscow  
and so the president has decided to create a russianamerican 
enterprise fund capitalized this year at fifty million  and the 
goal of this fund is to make direct loans to small businesses in 
russia to take equity positions in those businesses  
	     
	     the president has also decided to create a 
privatization fund which would work directly with the russian 
government in its priority objective of trying to convert state 
enterprises from a stateowned basis to a private basis  he has 
also agreed  the president has also agreed to establish a 
eurasia foundation  this would be a private foundation led by 
prominent americans to fund democratization projects in russia
	     
	     the fourth grouping you see there in the summary 
page is democratization itself  i think it is fair to say that 
this administration has given a new impetus to the goal of 
pursuing democratization in russia  you see that we have a total 
of fortyeight million in programs various programs  the detailed 
tables give an indication of some of the programs that we are 
launching  
	     
	     the president is also calling for the development of 
a democracy corps which will be an overarching umbrella group to 
try to incorporate all of the disparate private and public 
efforts now underway from the united states to support reform in 
russia
	     
	     the fifth program you see is russian office of 
resettlement  this is a new initiative created and 
conceptualized by this administration  this is a demonstration 
project  what we would like to do is work with the russian military 
to help resettle russian officers returning from the baltic 
states and other parts of the former soviet union  we want to 
make sure that we work out the best way to do that whether it is 
with russian labor and russian materials or using prefab american 
construction  and so we have decided to fund on a demonstration 
basis the construction of four hundred and fifty housing units  we will be working 
very closely with the russian military on this  and i would say 
that we have a longterm commitment to this project  
	     
	     the sixth area is energy in the environment  they 
are two issues that the president feels strongly about  our 
initial efforts will be feasibility studies to look into the 
possibility of enhancing their energy production both oil and 
gas and equally important trying to cut down on the leakages in 
the oil and gas pipeline systems which because so much 
environmental damage
	     
	     i have talked a little bit about trade and investment 
about the new group being created that the vice president will 
chair on our side  secretary ron brown will also be cochairing 
with deputy prime minister shohkin a business development 
committee which will work in all other sectors of the economy 
to break down the many barriers that currently exist and impede 
trade and investment  we are also going to appoint a fulltime 
investment ombudsman in the american government to work on this 
problem fulltime  
	     
	     and the point i would like to make here is trade and 
investment in the one thousand nine hundred and ninetys is every bit as important to draw an 
analogy as arms reductions was in the seventys and eightys  and we 
just thought that in looking at this we needed to make a 
commitment within our own government to have people work on it  
senior people on a fulltime basis because it is terribly 
important
	     
	     you will notice that the united states is going to 
support russias membership in the gatt  russia has had observer 
status  russia has requested our support and in fact requested 
our advice in becoming a member of the gatt  we think that the 
longterm goal of drawing russia into the global economy is 
paramount a very important goal  and that is why we are 
supporting the membership in the gatt  we are also supporting 
their access to gsp the generalized system of preferences  
	     
	     you will note that exi am has extended eightytwo million in 
credit for a caterpillar deal in siberia that opic has extended 
one hundred and fifty million in credits and loan guarantees for a conoco oil 
project  i would like to emphasize that we are very close to an 
agreement between russia and the united states for a twobillion 
framework facility through the exi am bank that would finance 
russian purchases of american oil and gas equipment and services 
we think this is a very important development  we think we will 
get there by april fourteenth which is the opening day of the tokyo 
conference the gseven conference
	     
	     before i take any further questions i would like to 
defer to my colleague who will review the security assistance 
objectives with you
	     
	     senior administration official  our major 
unfinished agenda with the russians and with their counterparts 
in ukraine kazakhstan and belarus is in the area of the safe and 
secure dismantlement of the nuclear arsenals on their territory 
under the terms of the start i and start ii agreements   
recently we completed in moscow three i think very important 
agreements that devote a significant chunk of nunnlugar funding 
to three important programs  the first is the program of one hundred and thirty 
million for the strategic nuclear delivery vehicle dismantlement 
program  that is for submarines for icbm dismantlement and for 
bomber dismantlement  one hundred and thirty million
	     
	     the second is a seventyfive million tranche of funding for 
the construction of a facility to store nuclear materials removed 
from the warheads as they are dismantled  this will essentially 
contribute to the overall design and the early phases of the 
construction of that storage facility  
	     
	     and finally a tenmillion tranche of money to help 
in the establishment of a monitoring system for the nuclear 
materials as they are withdrawn from the weapons system  so we 
add that two hundred and fifteenmillion total to the extant nunnlugar assistance 
which has been flowing  about one hundred and fifty million for some overall 
safety improvements for various kinds of equipment and safety 
measures that we have been working out with the russians over the 
last couple of years  
	     
	     so this is an area where we will be going a lot more 
work with not only the russians but with the ukrainians kazhaks 
and belarussians  belarus for example has just in the last 
couple of weeks received up to sixtyfive million in fyninetythree funds for 
safety security and dismantlement programs on belarussian 
territory  and this was in the wake of their ratification of 
start i an agreement to accede to npt 
	     
	     so we are working very hard with all the parties to 
the lisbon protocols and will continue to work very hard with 
them  and i look upon these three recent agreements with russia 
as a very important step in that process
	     
	     q	  the opic funds to  is that for the field in 
kazhakstan  and conoco already signed this deal with 
kazhakstan  why do you feel now it is necessary  if it is the 
same one why do you feel it is necessary
	     
	     senior administration official  it is not the same 
deal  chevron signed a deal with kazhakstan the tenges oil 
field  this is a new investment project  it is a polar lights 
oil development and renovation project and it is being announced 
today  so it is completely new
	     
	     q	  can you tell us more about what is involved
	     
	     senior administration official  yes  conoco like 
other american oil companies has been searching for ways to do 
two things  one to prospect for new oil in siberia west 
siberia and two to try to get into the business of renovating 
oil wells and renovating pipelines both oil and gas in russia  
the objective here obviously is to take advantage of the 
natural resources in russia increase energy production which 
will in turn increase hard currency revenues which is what 
russia needs
	     
	     so we think this deal is very very good development 
for russia  the russians do as well and it is good for an 
american company  and the american government has played a 
leading role in pulling this together through the credit facility 
in opic and through the loan guarantee
	     
	     q	  so it is to search and also to renovate fields 
that are already there
	     
	     senior administration official  that is right
	     
	     q	  on that point should other american companies 
expect to get administration support for such deals or should 
they now go to the exi am and try to get the money out of the two 
billion
	     
	     senior administration official  well as you know 
exi am is part of the yous government and various parts of the 
yous government have been pushing including the state department 
and the white house for this deal to be consummated  and we 
think it will  and if we arrive at this agreement by april fourteenth 
there will be two billion in financing available for american 
companies to sell their equipment and sell their services
	     
	     q	  that should take up all of the rest of the 
deals and their will not be  and their will or there will not be 
support for opic sort of deals such as this conoco
	     
	     senior administration official  there is a 
tremendous amount of interest on the part of american oil and gas 
companies to invest in russia  we think that the exi am oil and 
gas facility the twobillion facility once it is concluded will 
soak up a lot of that interest  but i think the interest may 
even extend beyond that  and if so the government will respond
	     
	     q	  what is the current year budget costs of that 
twobillion agreement should it go forward  and is there any 
current year budget costs 
	     
	     senior administration official  i will have to refer 
you to exi am for that  i do not know the details of that
	     
	     q	  the concessional food sales  is there any 
current year costs to that or is it delayed until the years in 
which the payments are due
	     
	     senior administration official  the concessional 
food sales are from food for progress which is a usda program  
usda has the funds we do not need to go back to the congress to 
expend those funds  there will be a hit in the budget  i would 
refer you to usda and omb for the details on that
	     
	     q	  can you talk about the democracy corps
	     
	     q	     and the private sector  how many folks are 
going to be involved in that
	     
	     senior administration official  why do not i start 
with the democracy corps first  i think the administration felt 
coming into office that there were literally thousands of 
organization private organizations in the united states that in 
one way or another were working at the goal of trying to achieve 
democratization in russia helping on a farmertofarmer basis  
and there were literally ten or fifteen yous government agencies that 
had a variety of programs in this area  and so the 
administration felt  the president felt it was important to try 
to draw all of these initiatives together under one group to give 
some coherence to the efforts and to give some impetus to the 
efforts  and so this is a presidential initiative
	     
	     it will be headed by ambassador tom simons who will 
soon take up his duties as the coordinator for yous assistance in 
the former soviet union  and we are very hopeful that we might 
use this democracy corps not only to draw upon the resources of 
our own government but the resources of the american private 
sector and schools and communities across the nation
	     
	     q	     any kind of commitment yet any kind of word 
yet on fyninetyfour and any new money that needs to be appropriated 
besides the three hundred million the president talked about
	     
	     senior administration official  the administration 
is requesting additional funds in fyninetyfour of seven hundred million  what 
the president has done this weekend is to consult really 
intensively yesterday with president yeltsin about additional 
measures the united states could take in some of these areas to 
support reform  he will be consulting with the congress  when he 
returns to washington he will be consulting also with the other 
ally governments and we will make a decision at that time
	     
	     q	  two questions about the seven hundred billion 
agricultural money  first of all i thought it was the sort of 
consensus that what russia did not need was more loans for food  
so why did you decide to do it that way  secondly could you 
explain  agriculture has been stopped from making further loans 
for food because of russias inability to pay  how does this fit 
into that situation
	     
	     senior administration official  as you know the 
united states for a long time has been a major supplier of grains 
and food commodities agricultural products to russia  i think 
between one thousand nine hundred and ninetyone and ninetytwo we had extended  a little bit of history 
here  about fivefive billion in credits credit guarantees through 
the commodity credit corporation  that was the principal vehicle 
to ensure the sale of american grain products  on december one of 
last year ninetytwo the russian government stopped its payments on 
that program  they are now in arrears to us on that program and 
therefore by law the united states cannot continue that 
program  and so the president working with secretary espy and 
other officials in the cabinet looked for other ways that we 
could promote american grain sales  
	     
	     and i think we have two ways to do that  we have 
announced today one hundred and ninetyfour million in grant food assistance through the 
food for progress program  but we do not have sufficient 
authority to spend seven hundred million in grant food and so we looked 
for a concessional loan program  
	     
	     i think everybody agrees that russia  that a 
shortterm loan program for russia would not make sense now but 
a longterm concessional loan program would  and that is what 
this program is  it will provide once the final details are 
worked out for a six to sevenyear grace period on payments of 
principal  and then from years seven through fifteen which is the 
life of the deal it will provide for concessional rates of 
interest  generally around three to four percent  and so we 
believe and the russian government believes this is a good deal 
for them because it will avoid the imperative of early payments 
and put them into the out years but it will also continue this 
very important grain relationship which is important for them 
and it is important for the american farm community
	     
	     q	  i gather from what you say that this could make 
it explicit  the russians failure to pay the interest on ecc 
loan does not in any way affect this kind of loan going through 
is that right 
	     
	     senior administration official  let me be explicit 
about that  we are prevented under the law to from continuing  
the commodity credit corporation shortterm credit program 
because of russias arrearages to the united states  all of you 
know about those arrearages  they total about i think around 
six hundred and forty million  usda can give you an exact figure  so having 
taken that into consideration and wanting to preserve american 
market share and a longterm grain relationship wanting to 
respond to a specific request from the russian government for 
major food assistance knowing that we could not take it from the 
grant programs because we do not have sufficient authority there 
we looked at food for progress which is a program we have used to 
great effect in other parts of the world  and we consulted with 
the russian government and arrived at this solution  
	     
	     i think the russians are pleased because it provides 
them with the food but also gives them a little bit of relief on 
the shortterm payments
	     
	     q	  where do those funds actually come from
	     
	     senior administration official  they come from the 
food for progress program which is a program under usdas 
authority  usda has the authority to spend these funds  we do 
not need to go back to the congress for these funds  and i want 
to make that general point again  everything in this package 
the onesix billion package comprises funds that have already been 
allocated and appropriated by the congress  the administration 
can begin to spend these monies tomorrow  and it is very 
important in our eyes that we expend all the funds this year 
that we meet these commitments  and we are confident we will be 
able to do so
	     
	     q	  how did you arrive at the figure of seven hundred 
million  does that max out that program or did you actually 
have a range from zero to 
	     
	     senior administration official  there is a reason 
for it  the reason was that the russian government told us 
that is about the amount of grain that they needed between now and 
harvest time  and so the idea is that we would begin the 
shipments probably one hundred million per month from now until the 
harvest in the autumn at which time russia will not require the 
same level of food imports from the west
	     
	     q	  i would imagine there is going to be some 
considerable envy and jealousy on the part of some of the other 
republics because of the size and the scope of this with russia  
have you given any consideration to advancing negotiations for 
the same kinds of projects with the ukraine with georgia  with 
some of the other republics
	     
	     senior administration official yes we are very 
conscience of the fact that we also have an interest in extending 
american support to the eleven other countries of the former soviet 
union  we have told ourselves and we have planned that in the 
area of technical assistance the grant technical assistance that 
you see roughly fifty percent of the funding will go to russia and 
roughly fifty percent to the other countries 
	     
	     in the area of food sales we have been active with 
ukraine in grant food assistance with georgia and armenia  we 
will continue that  and i think it is fair to say that after this 
summit we will go back and look at all of our programs with the 
other countries to ensure that they are adequate and they are 
productive and they are hardhitting
	     
	     q	  has anything happened at the summit to lead 
american energy companies and other companies to believe that 
russia is going to be more userfriendly toward them in terms of 
taxing legalities bureaucracy
	     
	     senior administration official  well one of our 
primary objectives coming into this summit was to highlight  not 
only the economic agenda but also trade and investment  and i would 
like to refer to the point i made at the beginning  we are 
convinced in talking about this problem  the problem of how to 
support russia longterm  we are convinced that no collection of 
western governments have the financial resources over the next 
decade to fuel the continuation of reform that only the private 
sector can do that  
	     
	     we look at our own society and we see tremendous 
capability in resources in the oil and gas sector  it is a very 
good match with what the russians need now which is financial 
investment in the existing oil and gas wells and pipeline and new 
technology and new capital to finance new production  
	     
	     that is what the russian government has told us it 
wants to do and so that is why we have made such a major emphasis 
on it  that is why trade and investment was a prominent issue on 
the first day of these talks and in fact figured prominently 
last night in the meeting between president yeltsin and president 
clinton  and we are hoping that together we might send a strong 
signal to the american business community that we support their 
efforts to invest in russia that the united states through ex
i am and opec and the department of commerce will be there to 
support them
	     
	     q	  my question is is yeltsin in any position to 
deliver on making russia a more 
	     
	     senior administration official  we think he is  i 
would note that president yeltsins prime minister mr 
chernomyrdin worked for thirty years in the russian oil and gas 
sector  he will now chair a highlevel commission with the vice 
president vice president gore to try to break through the 
barriers that currently exist to western investment in the oil 
and gas sector  we believe we have a commitment to make that 
committee an important committee  and we are looking forward to 
the work
	     
	     q	  what type of mechanism is already in place to 
administer the private sector portion of the program  and will 
the yous be directly involved in the tail end of distribution of 
the actual funds or is the money simply turned over to the 
russian government for distribution at their will
	     	    
	     senior administration official  are you talking 
about the variety of programs listed here  it depends on the 
program itself  in most cases though we are either working 
through american pbos or american government agencies to ensure 
that the money obviously is well spent that the money gets to 
the intended source  that is an obligation we have to the 
congress to ensure the money is well spent and that we can 
account for the money  we have done that in the last couple of 
months intensively and we will continue to do it for each of 
these programs
	     
	     but they are all quite different  for instance in 
the area of grant food and medical assistance for grant food it 
is carried out through usda and usda accounts for the delivery of 
the food  for grant medical assistance we have been working 
through project hope which is a private organization  for the 
housing  for instance the resettlement of russian officers 
we will be working with a group of american pbos  on some of the 
democratization projects we are working directly with russian 
private individuals and private foundations  we are working with 
journalists in russia on a media project that you may have 
noticed
	     
	     so we literally have here thirty to forty different 
activities under all these rubrics and they are all going to be 
carried out in slightly different ways  some directly with the 
russian government some with russian citizens
	     
	     q	  the jacksonvanik restrictions that remain and 
on the cocom restrictions that remain can you tell us what the 
president has to do on that
	     
	     senior administration official  well as george 
noted yesterday president yeltsin raised these as irritants in 
the relationship  the president has noted that  i think it is 
fair to say we will go back now in our own government when we 
return to washington and look at both of these questions and 
we will get back to the russian government
	     
	     q	  you were not prepared for these questions when 
you got here
	     
	     senior administration official  we were prepared 
for these questions  we have looked at them  but we are not 
prepared to make a quick decision this weekend  they require 
let me just explain particularly on jacksonvanik  they require 
consultation with the congress  they require consultation with 
the american jewish community  and we are very sensitive to those 
concerns  and so we will want to go back and talk to them before 
we take any action
	     
	     q	  is this package designed so that you will not 
have to go to congress for anything at this point
	     
	     senior administration official  as i said at the 
beginning the advantage of this particular package is that all 
the funds have been allocated and appropriated by the congress  
so the administration will not have to go back to the congress to 
seek any additional authority to fund any of these efforts  in 
effect they can all begin tomorrow and i know that many of the 
agencies responsible for these projects will begin tomorrow  and 
that is the advantage of this particular initiative
	     
	     q	  if this as the president says is a longterm 
longhaul thing and members of congress are at this moment 
heading for moscow why are not you talking about going to 
congress and suggesting to the president of russia that you are 
prepared to go to congress for various things
	     
	     senior administration official  i think we have been 
clear about that  the president is discussing this weekend with 
president yeltsin some additional ideas that we have for american 
funding of additional projects and ideas that he has  we have a 
major congressional delegation that left last night headed by 
representative gephardt and we will want to consult with that 
delegation and other members of congress before doing anything  
and we will also want to consult with our allies  so that is where 
it stands now
	     
	     q	  we have been told repeatedly that a number of 
these items represent different or new ways of spending the money 
already appropriated  could you just tick off which of these 
items represents reprogramming or at least spending money in ways 
that it was not previously set to be
	     
	     senior administration official  i think that we have 
said that these are all projects that either congress had 
allocated money for through the freedom support act there were 
some funds that were left over from fyninetytwo  and this 
administration took office and had some new ideas about how the 
funds might be expended
	     
	     we did not use just the freedom support act funds or 
the fyninetytwo funds  we went into some of the agency allocations 
exi am opic and usda  and tried to look for creative ways to 
further our programs
	     
	     and example of that is the food for progress 
concessional loans  we had hit a brick wall with another type of 
funding through usda  we could not go forward legally and so we 
looked for a more creative way to ensure continued american 
market share and ensure continued grain sales and we think we 
found it
	     
	     q	  where for example are you getting the money 
for this russian officer resettlement 
	     
	     senior administration official  that is from the 
freedom support act funds
	     
	     q	  in other words all of the money is being 
directly spent in new ways so to speak 
	     
	     senior administration official  most of the grant 
projects that you see  if you look at the general chart the 
second chart it is broken down into grant and credits  and if 
you look under grants the technical cooperation projects that 
total two hundred and eightyonenine million  that is almost all freedom support act 
funding  a little bit of it is leftover funds from fiscal year 
ninetytwo  the nunnlugar funds of course you know about the 
legislative history of those funds
	     
	     q	     cooperation 
	     
	     senior administration official  from fy ninetytwo  i 
do not have the exact figure  it was not a considerable figure
	     
	     q	  could you tell us please has anything happened 
here this weekend that will break the log jam between ukraine and 
russia over start  for start i and ii as a result of what is 
happened here 
	     
	     senior administration official  both presidents 
president yeltsin and president clinton will be discussing this 
issue this morning  in fact we have not yet gotten to security 
and arms control related issues  that will be this mornings 
session  i know that president clinton will be very strongly 
reinforcing that this is a top priority for us  we have been 
talking to the russians and the ukrainians over the last couple 
of weeks about ways that we might help to facilitate the 
discussions between them  up to this point this has been a very 
important negotiation that is been going on essentially between 
moscow and kiev  and we are at the point now of essentially 
discussing with them if there are ways that we could contribute 
to this discussion help to move things forward essentially  
	     
	     but in terms of what is coming out of this weekend 
i do not yet know  in a couple hours we will know
	     
	     q	    just a followup on the financing here  is 
any of this robbing peter to pay boris  since it is all current 
year appropriations have you taken it from anyplace that is been 
earmarked and put it into this fund
	     
	     senior administration official  there are smoke and 
mirrors here and i think it is an important point to note  we 
could have given you a page of assistance numbers that included 
outyear funding  we are going to make a longterm commitment to 
many of these projects  for instance the enterprise funds the 
privatization effort the housing effort  and we have already 
talked to the russians about our longterm commitment  
	     
	     we could have put in really big numbers and this 
could have been a bigger package but we wanted to make a point  
this package is fy ninetythree  it is funds that we have  and we are 
going to do what we say we are going to do  and the president 
feels very strongly about that  in the past there is a legacy 
that the western governments the combination of governments put 
up large budget figures and for any number of reasons we are not 
able to meet them we are determined and the president is 
determined to carry out every single program in this package  
and we will do it  
	     
	     but we do have a longerterm commitment and that is 
part of the discussions on economics this weekend  we are looking 
for russian ideas on what it is we can do to most effectively 
support reform  and we have told them that we do have a commitment 
on some of these programs beyond this fiscal year
	     
	     q	     taken it way from any 
	     
	     senior administration official  no we have not  
okay the question is have we reprogrammed any of these funds 
so have we taken it from other countries to pay for programs in 
russia  the answer is no we have not done so
	     
	     q	  in terms of funding there is no available 
monies left  and you simply find a creative way to find money 
somewhere else  does not that in fact support the  theory
	     
	     senior administration official  not at all  i 
do not think it does  that is a particular example and the 
example is grain sales  the commodity credit corporation credit 
guarantee program was shortterm loans that russia had to pay 
back within twelve to fifteen months  you all know about russias debt 
problem and russia was unable to meet those commitments  so we 
looked for a way to do two things  to meet russias requirement 
for grain  they are a net grain importer on a massive scale and 
also meet our objective of making sure that the american farmers 
have a chance to sell their products to russia  and we simply 
look for another way to finance that  and we have legislative 
authority to do it  this program has been successful in other 
areas  we had not tried it before in the former soviet union 
but we thought we should now
	     	  
	     q	  is not this really the bushclinton aid package 
for russia since these funds were really first derived by 
initiatives put forward by president bush
	     
	     senior administration official  no i do not think 
that is a fair characterization  a lot of these funds were 
appropriated by the yous congress is one thousand nine hundred and ninetyone in one thousand nine hundred and ninetytwo  this 
administration took office and inherited some obligations that 
the bush administration had made  but we had a long six to seven 
week review of this program  we decided to meet the commitments 
that had been made by the previous administration  
	     
	     but we have gone well beyond them in funding the 
enterprise fund which was just an idea but the idea had not 
been filled out with a program  there was no number attached to 
it  in grouping together some projects and trying to make them 
into a coherent whole in the privatization effort i would say 
is another clinton initiative  
	     
	     further we listened to the russian government and 
listened to the russian military who told us that the 
resettlement of their officers was important to them for 
political and economic and social reasons  and president clinton 
has responded to that  and we are making a longterm commitment 
that beyond this demonstration project we are going to figure out 
a way to do much more in trying to settle those officers  
	     
	     i would also say that the president has given 
impetus to all of us in the agencies to think much more broadly 
about what it is we can do on democratization because there we 
have some experience and some comparative advantage that lends 
itself to the russian experience  and in calling for the 
creation of a democracy corps which is another new initiative 
we are hopeful that we can take the resources of the private 
sector as well as the american government to achieve that 
objective  
	     
	     so i would not characterize it that way at all  and 
as most of you know i am a career civil servant  i was in the 
last administration  i am very familiar with what the last 
administration did  and i would characterize this as a clinton 
assistance package for russia
	     
	     q	  there is been a lot of criticism that aid in the 
past has not gotten to the people  is there anything in this 
outside of the ombudsman that will guarantee that this money 
will not just disappear because it is being administered by the 
russian government
	     
	     senior administration official  i think that  i 
know that the president and other senior officials of our 
government are concerned that american money be spent wisely and 
that it get to the source that it is intended  for which it is 
intended  and so we are going to take great care  aid and the 
state department will take great care in making sure that the 
funds are expended properly and that they are reaching their 
source
	     
	     i would not that this package is not simply a 
package of support solely to the russian government  some of 
these projects especially in democratization and exchanges are 
going to be worked out directly with russian private individuals 
with businesses  the private enterprise support is another 
example of that
	     
	     senior administration official  if i could just add 
a word on this point with regard to the ssdrelated programs one 
area that we have been looking at very very closely is 
consideration of actually using russian firms in subcontracting 
for these kinds of programs  they would be working very closely 
of course with the american firms who would be the prime 
contractors  but this is a fine example i think of a more of 
a imaginative and flexible approach toward getting some of that 
funding down to the grassroots level down to the ground in 
russia but at the same time ensuring that it is spent 
efficiently and for the purposes for which it was intended
	     
	     q	  when would the democracy corps start  exactly 
when do you see this happening  how would get it off the ground
	     
	     senior administration official  well the president 
is today calling for the creation of a democracy corps  i think 
it is fair to say that we are going to work out its framework over 
the next couple of weeks  ambassador simons takes up his duties 
on may onest  but in effect we have already started because over 
the last couple of weeks the administration has begun to reach 
out to people in the private sector who have come to us asking us 
to help facilitate their activities in russia  and we have said 
that we will be helpful  we have also tried to kind of coordinate 
in a much more effective way the activities of our own 
government  we do have ten or fifteen agencies that are active in 
russia in one way or another  we think it makes sense to draw 
them together and to focus their efforts
	     
	     q	  excuse me  how much of this onesix billion will 
actually be spent in the united states by american made goods
	     
	     senior administration official  i do not have any 
figures for you now but perhaps we could try to work something 
up in the next couple of days on that
	     
	     q	  this figure is larger than the figure that has 
been in the press  did this program grow yesterday as a result 
of the discussions or have we just been that far off the mark
	     
	     senior administration official  no i think 
unfortunately the press has been a little bit off the mark and 
i am sorry to say that  no this package  president clinton put 
us to work about seven weeks ago on this package  and he was 
briefed intensively on this  he contributed a lot of the 
intellectual leadership in this package  he contributed a lot of 
the ideas in the package  and i think it is fair to say that we 
had this rough package worked out about two weeks ago  we have 
been refining it ever since  we spent a couple of days last week 
going over it with the russian government both the embassy in 
washington and the government in moscow through our own embassy  
and so it is been evolving  but this particular package has been 
together for about two weeks
	     
	     q	  where is yeltsins input into this then  there 
was so much talk before about the president wanted to get 
yeltsins views about specifically what was needed and so forth  
is that in the out years
	     
	     senior administration official  no it is both  
president yeltsin has on several occasions told us for instance 
that support for the creation of private businesses is important 
to him that the resettlement of russian military officers is 
important and that first and foremost the effort to privatize 
the state industries is important to them  
	     
	     and so what we did was to try to make those the 
centerpiece of our technical assistance part o the package  we 
listened to him  on the privatization effort we have been 
working with the russian government for months on this trying to 
work out all the details  so the russian government on most of 
these programs was involved every step of the way  
	     
	     but let me get at the other part of your question  
the president is also using this weekend to talk about a broader 
set of initiatives that we might undertake  and we are looking 
for his ideas  the president has brought his own ideas to the 
table  for instance on energy and the environment and in 
housing  but we are looking for russian ideas not  we need to 
consult with the congress and we need to consult with the other 
allied governments that are also active
	     
	     q	  there is essentially nothing that happened in 
the last day and a half that measurably altered the package that 
you came in with
	     
	     senior administration official  this particular 
package as i said was worked out and was ready about two weeks 
ago  we have since then consulted with the russian government on 
the final stages of its development and so this weekend we have 
primarily talked about future about what more the united states 
and other western countries can do to support reform in russia 
which is our base objective here
	     
	     q	  i noticed that you  that money appropriated 
to train bankers and businessmen and officers  can you tell me 
what about job training for workers who are displaced by 
privatization
	     
	     senior administration official  you are right we 
have a program to train russian  young russians in banking and 
financial services in the united states  part of the housing 
initiative it is not just to build housing units it is to retrain 
russian officers who are retiring into other professions
	     
	     q	     money for job training for workers whose 
jobs are disappearing because of privatization 
	     
	     senior administration official  we have not yet 
allocated any money for that
	     
	     q	  why not
	     
	     q	     of the six million is going to build four hundred and fifty 
housing units  is not that a lot of money per unit given what the 
western dollar will buy in the former soviet union
	     
	     senior administration official  if you want to do 
housing the right way it is not just the building the framework 
of a house you have got to think about all the utilities  you have 
got to think about the purchase of land  you have got to think 
about sewage and gas and electricity and so forth  and it is also 
retraining  it is not enough to put retired  an officer coming 
out of  riga or tallin or vilnius in a house in western russia  
we think we have an obligation to try to retrain those officers 
as well  this is responding to a request from the russian 
government
	     
	     q	     of the six million will go to retrain 
	     
	     senior administration official  that is right
	     
	     q	  are you talking about apartment buildings or 
single 
	     
	     senior administration official  we are talking about 
single individual dwellings
	     
	     q	  you are saying that only four hundred and fifty families will be 
served by this
	     
	     senior administration official  what i want to  i 
thought i pointed out earlier this is a demonstration project  
what we did not want to do  given the experience that the 
germans and the turks and the italians have had in building 
housing in western russian we did not want to leap into it with 
a huge amount of money  what we want to do is work over the next 
couple of months and try to figure out with american 
organizations in the private sector the best way to get this job 
done  
	     
	     i noted that we have a longterm commitment to that  
and so i would expect that we would put a lot more money into 
this in the future   but we want to do it wisely we want to 
spend the money wisely
	     
	     q	  what is it about this program that convinces 
you that it will protect russias reforms and that russia will be 
in a position to may back the money they are supposed to pay back 
especially considering their other debt problem
	     
	     senior administration official  well look i think 
it is important to note that the united states on its own does not 
have the capability to fuel a continuation of russian reform  
it is got to be a collective western effort and we are looking to 
our allies to do more as well  but beyond that it is really what 
the russians do that is going to decide the fate of reform  we 
can simply play a role and we feel we have an obligation to do 
so which is consistent with our national interests
	     
	     q	  did the president say that the value of the 
yous contribution was that it would create security and 
prosperity for the united states  so what is it about this 
program that does this
	     
	     senior administration official  i think you have to 
go back to the fundamental objective of our policy toward russia 
and that is we want to do everything we can to support the 
continuation of reform  we are convinced that if reformers stay 
in power then we will be able to continue the drawdown of nuclear 
forces foreign policy cooperation and economic interaction 
which are the three benefits to the united states from reform in 
russia  so it is not a simple question  you cannot just say that 
this program is the answer  it is a longterm question and we 
have to make a longterm commitment to it
	     
	     q	  and then on the question of russias ability to 
repay what convinces you they will be able to pay seven to fifteen 
years from now
	     
	     senior administration official  well the russian 
government has made a commitment to repay and what we are hoping 
is that if reform continues and if they can continue to improve 
their oil and gas sector and earn additional hard currency 
revenues that russia will be in a position six or seven years 
from now to pay back those loans
	     
	     q	     substantial governmenttogovernment loan 
we have ever gotten into with the russians
	     
	     senior administration official  i do not want to 
answer authoritatively on that  i do not go back twenty or thirty years 
on this  but in the last four or five years yes it is because 
the previous way that we financed grain exports was really to 
just ensure private bank loans  this is a different type of 
effort
	     
	     q	     government loans in any other sector that 
you recall  i know it was not done in 
	     
	     senior administration official  i think it is fair 
to say this is a new and unique effort

  first let me correct myself in that it was goerbels and
                                              
  not goering airforce who ran the nazi propaganda machine

   instead of joseph goebbels and you dare to say that you
   know more about nazi germany than most people maybe including us  
   i am sure you learned the history of nazi germany and austria from
   your family  
  
 	what i resent is ignorant statements that call people
 names when they disagree with your position opposing the
 atrocities commited by the israeli governement hardly qualifies
 as antisemitism if you think name calling is a valid form of
 argument in intellectual circles you need to get out more
 often
 
  trying to make comparisons between israels politics and nazi german
  austrian politics shows only your degree of ignorance high intellect
  low humanity none and antisemitism average i respect anybody
  who dissagrees with me as long as he respects me and discusses in a
  civilized manner i would never say that anybody that critizises israel
  andor its politics is an antisemite except he uses antisemitic
  vocabularyterminologydemagogy israel is not a perfect country and
  its politicians also commits errors even some of them are corrupt
  like politicians in any other country but they carry a huge burden
  to care for the safety of all its citizens and that is really not an
  easy task in a country that is surrounded by enemies who only expect
  that israel commits the one big error and wipe the country and its
  jewish citizens plus the socalled collaborators arabs that wanted to
  live in peace with their jewish neighbours of the map as i said
  israel is not a perfect country but it is the only democracy in the
  whole middleeast and the only country in the world where jews from
  everywhere can have a refuge in case of persecutions in the countries
  they are living
  our long history has taught us that we cannot rely on nonjewish
  nations and its governments as soon as there are more or les big
  socialeconomicalpolitical problems in any country the first ones
  that pay for the broken glasses are the jews and later the other
  minorities of the country
  
 i do not think the suffering of some jews during wwii
                     
 justifies the crimes commited by the israeli government any
 attempt to call civil liberterians like myself antisemetic is
 not appreciated

  this is really outrageous sixzerozero murdered jews besides the
  thousands  who survived the shoa in some way or another and the rest
  of the living ones mourning for all of them  i do not know what you
  call a civil libertarian never heard about them but i know only
  one thing if all of them think like you do it then civil libertarians
  is a new denomination for antisemites may other civil libertarians come
  to word to this group so that we can learn if abeyer and me are right
  that civil libertarians are antisemites or that i am wrong and he is
  missusing that word
  by the way i could not care less for what andi beyer appreciates

took a large amount of punishment and refused submit  

i am curious why you think that particular adjective is important

i am curious why you took a beign statement and crossposted it to several
different news groups including something along the lines of 
altdiscrimination  

exsqueeze me  i saw your original post in altdiscrimination
your post was crossposted to three groups  my followup was crossposted
to two of those three omitting socmotss

now instead of engaging in metadiscussion off the topic could you answer 
the question posed  if your statement is so beign you should have no
trouble politely responding to a polite query

       well i do not think your query was exactly polite but i will try to
give you a polite responce  something atypical of the net but here it goes

       black is a descriptive adjective that describes mr king  from many
of the newspaper radio and tv news reports i have seen this adjective      
is commonly in front of his name  i have never seen anyone complain about
the use of this adjective when used in a benign manner  i did not say that
mr king was a no good black  i do not know mr king and would not make this
ascertian without some evidence to this effect  i used it purely as a 
descriptive adjective in the same manner than many  most  news people have
used it in the past


      the entire second trial was about race ted  i do not feel compelled to
discuss mr kings racial background but had mr king been white there would
not have been a second trial  you probably are saying that the beating would
not have occurred if he were white but that is an extremely difficult call
to make  it is possible the case but not definately  

      i still think your actions are crap ted  they are far more divisive than
me using the adjective black in a nonderogenory manner  would you have
been happier if i had used africanamerican   if so then you really are
lost in the world of pc  you have already been instrumental in getting one
persons net access revoked and i wonder if you have sent a copy of my 
message to my sys admin with a plea that i am not worthy of posting

     the way you went about this polite inquiry makes me believe it was 
anything but

 actually not  brett himself has actually posted the data previously
 what declined from eightyfour to eightynine as i remember it was percent

 twond derivative of total deficit with respect of to time decreased

	would you please define nth derivative of debt  last time i asked
you seem to have disappeared

	and it is the deficits themselves that came down to twonine of gnp  the
numbers are posted in the previous posting

 brett apparently has numbed himself into thinking that the deficit
 declined  

	cute paul but with no numbers you still look foolish

 if you keep spending more than you earn the deficit keeps
 growing  

	paul like many others is confusing the deficit with the debt

 if you keep borrowing at a lesser rate than you borrowed
 previously the deficit increases  you only decrease deficits when your
 income exceeds spending and you use the difference to pay off debts

	not in terms of gnp the one universally accepted measure of deficits
at least among rigorous economists 


 arguments were brilliant  he confirmed with data what many of us know
 with common sense  the boom of the eightys has nothing to do with government
 policy particularly supply side policy since taxes do not because 
 economic activities  people because economic activity  more can be

economic activities

does the killing

 explained by watching population waves roll through the years and 
 create cycles  he has made models and predictions for years well into
 the middle of next century  it will be neat to see how accurate he
 is

subject re facinating facts thirty bit serial number possibly fixed sone and stwo
organization university of illinois  urbanachampaign
lines thirtytwo

the only way to view this method of generating unit keys is as a backdoor
what else can you call a key deterministically generated from the serial
number


 to generate the unit key for a serial number n the thirtybit value n is
   first padded with a fixed thirtyfourbit block to produce a sixtyfourbit block none
   sone and stwo are then used as keys to tripleencrypt none producing a
   sixtyfourbit block rone

	   rone  edenone sone stwo sone 

   similarly n is padded with two other thirtyfourbit blocks to produce ntwo and
   nthree and two additional sixtyfourbit blocks rtwo and rthree are computed  

	   rtwo  edentwo sone stwo sone 
	   rthree  edenthree sone stwo sone 

   rone rtwo and rthree are then concatenated together giving one hundred and ninetytwo bits the
   first eighty bits are assigned to uone and the second eighty bits to utwo  the
   rest are discarded  the unit key you is the xor of uone and utwo  uone and utwo
   are the key parts that are separately escrowed with the two escrow
   agencies


what happens is that the need for the escrow houses is completely eliminated
or should i say the need to access the escrow houses to decrypt the data
the houses will still serve a real purpose as far as generating the illusion
of protection and smalltown cops will not be let in on the secret so they
will still go through the motions of going to the escrow houses but the fact
is the federal government can and will build a chip which generates the unit

i do not know a whole lot on proton but given that it is a multi stage

it may end up seriously beating on said centaur   

the proton has been used in two three and four stage versions  the two stage version
was used for the first three launches while the three and four stage versions are used
today  the four stage version is used mostly for escape and geosynchronous
orbits while the three stage version is used for low earth orbits  since this is
the version that launched mir and the salyuts and the addon modules for mir
as long as centaur is smaller than mir which i believe it is it should fit

some possible attacks on ripem


this is a living list of potential weaknesses to keep your eyes open
for when using ripem for secure electronic mail  it does not go into
great detail and is almost certainly not exhaustive  obviously many
of the weaknesses are weaknesses of cryptographically secured mail in
general and will pertain to secure mail programs other than ripem
it is maintained by marc vanheyningen   it
is posted monthly to a variety of news groups followups pertaining
specifically to ripem should go to altsecurityripem

cryptanalysis attacks


 breaking rsa would allow an attacker to find out your private key
  in which case he could read any mail encrypted to you and sign
  messages with your private key

  rsa is generally believed to be resistant to all standard
  cryptanalytic techniques  even a standard key about five hundred and sixteen bits with
  ripem is long enough to render this impractical barring a
  huge investment in hardware or a breakthrough in factoring

 breaking des would allow an attacker to read any given message
  since the message itself is encrypted with des  it would not allow
  an attacker to claim to be you

  des has only fiftysix bits in its key and thus could conceivably be
  compromised by brute force with sufficient hardware but few agencies
  have such money to devote to simply read one message  since each
  message has a different des key the work for each message would
  remain high

key management attacks


 stealing your private key would allow the same benefits as breaking
  rsa  to safeguard it it is encrypted with a des key which is derived
  from a passphrase you type in  however if an attacker can get a copy
  of your private keyfile and your passphrase by snooping network
  packets tapping lines or whatever he could break the whole scheme

  the main risk is that of transferring either the passphrase or the
  private key file across an untrusted link  so do not do that  run 
  ripem on a trusted machine preferably one sitting right in front of
  you  ideally your own machine in your own home or maybe office
  which nobody else has physical access to

 fooling you into accepting a bogus public key for someone else could 
  allow an opponent to deceive you into sending secret messages to him
  rather than to the real recipient  if the enemy can fool your
  intended recipient as well he could reencrypt the messages with
  the other bogus public key and pass them along

  it is important to get the proper public keys of other people
  the most common mechanism for this is finger assuming the opponent
  has not compromised routers or daemons or such finger can be 
  given a fair amount of trust  the strongest method of key
  authentication is to exchange keys in person however this is
  not always practical  having other people vouch for you by
  signing a statement containing your key is possible although 
  ripem does not have features for doing this as automatically as
  pgp  ripem does generate and check mdfive fingerprints of public keys
  in the key files they may be exchanged via a separate channel for
  authentication

playback attacks


 even if an opponent cannot break the cryptography an opponent could
  still because difficulties  for example suppose you send a message
  with miconly a pem mode which does not provide disclosure protection
  to alice which says ok let us do that your opponent intercepts
  it and now resends it to bob who now has a message which is
  authenticated as from you telling him to do that  of course he may
  interpret it in an entirely different context  or your opponent
  could transmit the same message to the same recipient much later
  figuring it would be seen differently at a later time  or the
  opponent could change the originatorname to himself register 
  your public key as his and send a message hoping the recipient
  will send him return mail indicating perhaps even quoting the
  unknown message

  to defeat playback attacks the plaintext of each message should 
  include some indication of the sender and recipient and a unique
  identifier typically the date  a good frontend script for ripem
  should do this automatically imho  as a recipient you should be
  sure that the originatorname header and the sender indicated within
  the plaintext are the same that you really are a recipient and that
  the message is not an old one  some this also can and should be
  automated  the author of this faq has made a modest attempt at
  automating the process of generating and checking encapsulated
  headers the programs are included in the standard distribution in
  the utils directory

local attacks


 clearly the security of ripem cannot be greater than the security of
  the machine where the encryption is performed  for example under
  unix a superuser could manage to get at your encrypted mail
  although it would take some planning and effort to do something like
  replace the ripem executable with a trojan horse or to get a copy of
  the plaintext depending how it is stored

  in addition the link between you and the machine running ripem is
  an extension of that  if you decrypt with ripem on a remote machine
  which you are connected to via network or worse yet modem an
  eavesdropper could see the plaintext and probably also your
  passphrase

  ripem should only be executed on systems you trust obviously  in
  the extreme case ripem should only be used on your own machine
  which you have total control over and which nobody else has access
  to which has only carefully examined software known to be free of
  viruses and so on  however there is a very real tradeoff between
  convenience and security here

  a more moderately cautious user might use ripem on a unix workstation
  where other people have access even root access but increase
  security by keeping private keys and the statically linked of
  course executable on a floppy disk

  some people will keep ripem on a multiuser system but when dialing
  in over an insecure line they will download the message to their
  own system and perform the ripem decryption there  however the
  security provided by such a mechanism is somewhat illusory since
  you presumably type your cleartext password to log in you have just
  given away the store since the attacker can now log in as you and
  install traps in your account to steal your private key next time
  you use it from a less insecure line  this will likely remain the
  situation as long as most systems use the rather quaint mechanism of
  cleartext password authentication

  i find it nice to put a brief statement of how carefully i manage my
  security arrangement in my plan next to my public key so that
  potential correspondents can be aware what level of precautions are
  in place  some people use two keys a short one which is not
  carefully managed for ordinary use and a longer one which is treated
  with greater care for critical correspondence

untrusted partner attacks


 ripems encryption will ensure that only a person with the private key
  corresponding to the public key used to encrypt the data may read the
  traffic  however once someone with that key gets the message she
  may always make whatever kind of transformations she wishes  there 
  exist no cryptographic barriers to a recipient say taking an
  encrypted message and converting it to a miconly message signed by
  you and readable by anyone although ripem does not provide this
  functionality  indeed the latest pem draft i have seen specifically
  states that such transformations should be possible to allow
  forwarding functions to work
 
  including the recipients in the plaintext as mentioned above will
  make it possible for recipients of a redistributed message to be aware
  of its original nature  naturally the security of the cryptography
  can never be greater than the security of the people using it

i have been following the giants closely over the offseason  newspapers
notesgroup etc  but i had my first up close and personal last night at
the stick

after watching giants hitters struggle last year barrys swing was 
very impressive  he is very quick and his swing seems effortless even
compared to clark particularly clark as of late

it was interesting to see bonds hit maddux so well  i am not sure if
barry was after revenge against the braves or what but he stroked
three very pretty hits oneb twob hr for five rbis

     the giants always hit maddux well but it was interesting that maddux
did not pitch around bonds to get to clayton last night  he threw two straight
fastballs over the plate to bonds in the onest last night got away with the
first one but bonds hit the second one out of the park  then in the threerd
when clark was at third base with one out maddux did not intentionally
walk bonds and bonds dropped a single to leftcenter


the giants as a team are doing a lot of surprising things this year in
addition to bonds  there has been some good pitching and some hitters
seem to be swinging much better  claytons defense has been superb
mcgee seems to like leading off this year  manwaring is driving the ball
so on  so forth

     the braves announcers pointed out that mcgee as a leadoff hitter has
not scored a run yet  he will always hit around three hundred but i am concerning
about his onbase percentage  the key in the lineup is matt williams he
has to stay hot so that bonds can hit with runners on base


i hope it continuesi think they need to continue well into june before
people are really sold that they are for realparticularly the pitching

     the pitching gets a set back as bud black is placed on the dl  burba
has done a superb job filling in so far he looks like a different pitcher
from last year  however swift is terrible in both of his starts  with
burba moving into the rotation mike jackson is the only righthanded
reliever aside from rod beck he will get a lot of actions  i also hope that
dusty can manage his bullpen better than roger craig especially on beck
i was concerned when beck was used for three straight days earlier this week


for myself i think the fresh start of magowanbakeretc has really wiped
out a lot of negatives from the last few years and will be a real factor
in helping them significantly improve over last year

     so far so good

i somewhat agree with you  however what it comes to theist religion 
it is a different matter  that is because religion is like a drug once you
use it it is very difficult to get out of it  that is because in
order to experience a religion you necessarily have to have blind faith
and once you have the blind faith it is very diffcult for you to reason
yourself back to atheism again
therefore it is unreasonable to ask people to try religion in order to
judge it  it is like asking people to try dying to find out what
death is like

well now we cannot judge death until we are dead right  so why should
we judge religion without having experienced it  people have said that
religion is bad by any account and that it is in no way useful etc
but i do not totally agree with this  of course we cannot really say
how the religious folk would act had they not been exposed to religion
but some people at least seemed to be helped in some ways by it

so basically we can not judge whether religion is the right route for
a given individual or even for a general population  we can say that
it is not best for us personally at least you can choose not to use
religionmight be hard to try to find out its benefits as you state

the chip and algorithm are classified  if you reverse engineer it and
tell people you are likely to go to jail

well i am not a lawyer but from what i can tell this is completely
and utterly untrue

you see this country has this thing called a constitution

if you legitimately aquire the device and you yourself are
not a government employee or otherwise encumbered i do not think they
can stop you from revealing anything about the device you can
determine remember the pentagon papers precedent the first amendment
applies here

the yous does not have an official secrets act we do have laws that
will punish you for revealing what classified information you learned
in your capacity as a government official contractor etc and we
have laws that prohibit stealing such information however if they
sell you the chip i cannot see that they can make reverse engineering
it and revealing the details illegal

 cnn is reporting as i write this that the atf has ignited all
 the buildings of the branch dividian ranch near waco tx the
 lies from atf say holes were made in the walls and nonlethal tear
 gas pumped in a few minutes after this started the whole thing went up
 all buildings are aflame no one has escaped i think it obvious that
 the atf used armored flamethrower vehicles to pump in unlit
 napalm then let the wood stove inside ignite it

well actually the davidians koreshians started the fire themselves 
the last i heard  around fifteenzero est eight people ran out into the feilds
surrounding the compound all were captured and two admitted to setting the 
fire i do not buy your napalm theory at all although it would have made a 
great commercial for my sig why the hell would they have a wood stove
burning on such a warm day  flame throwers use liquid petroleum napalm 
is more of a gel now to further dispute your theory the diluted cs gas
was inserted around sixzero if i understood correctly the place did not start
burning until around tenzero or elevenzero
 
 this is murder atf murderers  butchers
 this is genocidal massslaughter of innocent people including children

 it happen i had hoped i was wrong i had hoped that there was

 alive i was wrong the nazis have won
 
calm down kid vernon koreshs real name said himself that he would not leave
that compound alive the inhabitants thereof had accepted the fact that they 
may very well have to kill themselves before it was all over

 i repeat as of this time there are no  survivors

there are at least eight survivors a caller on rush limbaugh today suggested
that the rest may even be hiding in underground bunkers that is not such a wild

meeting yeah that is the ticket what are some guidelines should i just 
pick up another shoei in my size to have a backup helmet xl or should i 
maybe get an inexpensive one of a smaller size to accomodate my likely 
passenger 

if your primary concern is protecting the passenger in the event of a
crash have him or her fitted for a helmet that is their size  if your
primary concern is complying with stupid helmet laws carry a real big
spare you can put a big or small head in a big helmet but not in a
small one

  well you can accomplish both goals actually if you have a definite
physical type in mind when you go to these cough church meetings  if
your tastes tend to smaller more petite cough churchgoers it is more
likely that they will have a smaller head and you can safely get a medium
or small helmet

  this works for me and i traded my spare large helmet with my best friend
who at sixnine tends to look more for women that are over sixzero and cannot
usually fit into the medium size helmet he previously had

  of course if you are not picky what size cough churchgoers you give
helpful motorcycle rides to then eds advice will hopefully cover any
eventuality as far as legality is concerned and a spare handtowel in the
tankbag makes acceptable padding so the passenger can see out of the viewport
rather than the padding above the viewport in the cases of extreme mismatch

this may be a really dumb one but i will ask it anyways
	christians know that they can never live up to the requirements of  
god right i may be wrong but that is my understanding  but they still  
try to do it  does not it seem like we are spending all of our lives  
trying to reach a goal we can never achieve  i know that we are saved by  
faith and not by works but does that mean that once we are saved we do not  
have to do anything  i think james tells us that faith without works is  
dead paraphrase  how does this work

so long as we think that good things are what we have to do rather than
what we come to want to do we miss the point the more we love god the
more we come to love what and whom he loves

when i find that what i am doing is not good it is not a sign to try
even harder romans sevenfourteeneighttwo it is a sign to seek god when i am aware 
of jesus presence i usually want what he wants it is his strenth his love 
that empowers my weakness
 
stan armstrong religious studies dept saint marys university halifax ns
armstronghuskyonestmarysca  attclydewatmathwaterdalcsarmstrng

i apologize to the moderator but the first quote was deleted and i
would like to respond to both

as for the goal we can never achieve the reward comes from the
trying  paul makes a clear claim that we are to continue straining for
the prize over in philippians threetensixteen  only by not living out the
commands do we stagnate and become lukewarm to be spit out by jesus
as it says in one john fivethree  this is love for god  to obey his comands
that obedience is our straining to achieve for god  of course this
requires work on our part

as for the quote in james satan does not care what we believe  what
matters is the results of our belief works  if one truly has faith in
what one believes one will either act on that faith or be lying to
oneself about believing in the first place  

stan as for your first line you have a very good point  obedience by
obligation grudgery is not what god desires  instead look at how
many times the bible talks about being joyous in all situations and when
doing gods work  being begrudged by the work has no value  also we
should do the work necessary whenever we can not just when we feel
jesus presence  feelings can deceive us  however as paul states to
timothy in two timothy fourtwo  preach the word be prepared in season and
out of season correct rebuke and encouragewith great patience and
careful instruction  also remember that paul tells timothy in one
timothy foursixteen  watch your life and doctrine closely  persevere in
them because if you do you will save both yourself and your hearers
so in order to do the work necessary we need to be sure that we are
correct first  remember jesus warning in matthew seventhreefive not to be
hypocritical about what we do  the best way to accomplish this is to be
a disciple completely in both thought and deed

sirtf is still very much in business

by mark whalen
     in these times of extratight nasa budgets the very
survival of a number of missions has been uncertain but thanks
to major design refinements implemented in recent months jpls
space infrared telescope facility sirtf  a major project
considered to be in trouble a couple of years ago  is alive
and well according to project scientist michael werner
     a lighter spacecraft revised orbit and shorter mission have
added up to a less expensive project with tremendous scientific
power and a bright future said werner
     designed as a followup to the highly successful infrared
astronomical satellite iras and cosmic background explorer
cobe missions sirtf  a cryogenically cooled observatory for
infrared astronomy from space  is scheduled for launch in two thousand
or two thousand and one if plans proceed as scheduled
     iras pioneering work in spacebased infrared astronomy ten
years ago allowed astronomers to view the milky way as never
before and revealed among other things sixtyzero galaxies and twentyfive
comets it provided a sky survey onezero times more sensitive than
any previously available from groundbased observations cobe has
measured the infrared and microwave background radiation on large
angular scales and revealed new facts about the early universe
     but to illuminate sirtfs potential jim evans jpls
manager of astrophysics and fundamental physics preprojects
recently said that the project is onezero to one million times more
capable than iras based on technological advances in infrared
detector arrays
     however despite the enormous strides in infrared
exploration sirtf promised and the fact that it was cited as the
highest priority new initiative for all of astronomy in the one thousand nine hundred and ninetys
by the national academy of sciences it took a diet or die
directive from nasa headquarters last year to keep the project
going according to werner
     the project is now known as atlas sirtf based on the key
factor in its new design the satellite will orbit the sun
instead of the earth permitting the use of an atlas rocket
launch instead of the formerly proposed and heavier titan the
main advantage of the solar orbit is that you can use all of your
launch capability for boosting the payload  you do not have to
carry up a second rocket to circularize the orbit werner said
the other advantage to a solar orbit he said is that it is in a
better thermal environment away from the heat of the earth
     additional major changes in sirtfs redesign include
shortening the mission from five to three years and building a
spacecraft that is less than half as heavy as in the original
plan  atlas sirtf will weigh twofour hundred and seventy kilograms fivefour hundred pounds
compared to titan sirtfs fivefive hundred kilograms twelveone hundred pounds
     all of that adds up to a less stressful launch
environment werner said and a cost savings of more than two hundred
million for the launch in addition to increased savings in the
design of the smaller less massive spacecraft
     werner said sirtfs redesign came as a result of congress
telling nasa you are trying to do too many things if you want us
to support sirtf which is a good project develop a plan to see
how it fits into nasas overall strategy
     shortly thereafter sirtf was named as nasas highest
priority flagship scientific mission by the interdisciplinary
space sciences advisory committee in addition to the blessing
from the national academy of sciences
     while the spacecraft and its instruments required descoping
to keep the project alive sirtfs major scientific contribution
always promised to come about from its advanced infrared detector
arrays which will allow images to be developed tens of
thousands of times faster than before according to evans
     up until a couple of years ago werner said all infrared
astronomy was done with single detectors  or very small arrays
of individually assembled detectors since then the department
of defense has developed a program to produce arrays of tens or
hundreds of thousands of detectors rather than just a few and
those are very well suited for use on sirtf
     werner noted that in addition to dealing with budget
pressures congress is currently watching nasa projects with an
eye out for any technological spinoff
     on that question i think we have some things to say he
said because the detectors we are using are straight off various
military developments also sirtf will be built by the yous
aerospace industry and it is a real technological and engineering
challenge in addition to being a tremendous scientific project
     sirtf will be used by the entire astronomical community
werner added but the revised threeyear mission puts a premium
on observing time we have to educate the user community and
develop a program that involves early surveys and quick
turnaround of the data
     werner said the downsizing of the project required a
reduction in scope and complexity of sirtfs three instruments 
the infrared spectrograph infrared array camera and multiband
imaging photometer however these reductions will only result in
losses of efficiency rather than capability he said
     the project hopes to start a phase b activity in one thousand nine hundred and ninetyfive
which will provide a detailed concept for development and design
building the hardware would begin about two years later
     projected cost estimates evans said are eight hundred and fifty millionnine hundred and fifty
million
     i am very optimistic about sirtf he said it will
provide a tremendous return for the investment
     werner added that an additional benefit from the project
will be the enrichment of our intellectual and cultural
environment people on the street are very interested in
astronomy  black holes the possibility of life on other
planets the origin of the universe  and those are the kind of
questions sirtf will help answer

it is a much better deal to have him end his term of office in disgrace after
watching all his liberal democrat friends on his staff run this nation down
the toilet

tsk surely you do not wish for the democrats to destroy our beloved country
just so your party can get some trivial political advantage that is rather
a petty way to think not that this pettiness does not extend all the way
to the yous senate i have noticed

while bush was president i kept hoping and praying that he would wise up i
could not stand the man but i wish he would done a decent job if so we might
not be in the mess we are now and that would be a small price to pay for
suffering through another term of republican control similarily you should
be hoping and praying that clinton does a good job even if you are certain
he will not

of the chip that would interoperate with official clipper chips  but
the cloner would not provide the keys to the escrow houses  hmmn

								yeah

	the algorithm is classified because a military contract or similar
government equivalent to military has been let for this proprietary
design that the feds say that nsa developed  is there a patent  is that
patent publicly available  my betting is that that too is classified

this does not apply for muslims only of course same for jews and for some

and when the objective is i think however that you are wrong to convert 
everybody it is just a matter of time when violence will occur


are not we able to learn anything from thouthands of years of conversion related

    i wonder if your mac has those little reset  interupt switches

this problem is usually a low five vdc from the power supply there is an

summary tanks against civilians could not happen here read yer history
organization totally unorganized
lines seventy

in article  scottjmagicdmlgeorgetownedu john l scott writes

   picking nits over tanks firing the main gun or not deleted 
 

i think the point is being missed  that it is apparantly acceptable for
big government big brother to use tanks to control the people as
long as they do not use the big gun but everything else is allright

tanks deployed against civilians let alone firing on them with crew
served weaponry a fifty heavy machine gun is crewserved is something
both our press and government howl about instantly when done in some
other country  against civilians that have at most oneshotatatime
light small arms  certainly nothing that places the people in or behind
the tank in any real danger  molotov coctails  a round from a rifle
or pistol deals with anybody approaching with one of those  and snipers
too often turn out to be strays from other copsguardarmy gunfire

i do not know about the other people in this group or on the net but
the idea of tanks being used to control civilians in anything that
pretends to be a free society is outrageous  when big government feels
it is necessary to use that kind of force to stomp out protests even
violent of the citizens that suggests that the government is totally
out of control since that is effectively the government declaring war
on its own people  if the government was living up to its responsibility
government of the people by the people not the lords and other elites
who want to keep their good thing going the citizens would not feel the
need to be resorting to acts that need to be squashed with a military
boot  people do things like that because they have become convinced
that it is the only option that remains other attempts to have grievances
redressed have been ignored  and yes there is a criminal element that
will exploit this but the fact remains that the government has been
unresponsive or such acts would not be apt to happen  still not an excuse
to open up on civilians with tanks heavy machine guns or whatever
its the old might makes right philosophy that is the hallmark of a
government going rogue  they do not like it tough we will simply
squash them under an iron boot  actually addressing their grievances
in other than token fashion with huge volumes of hot air is just too
inconvenient  sort of a variation on mushroom management  keep them
in the dark smother them with shit and crush them when ready

and these are the folks that many liberals are trying to arrange things
so that they will have a monopoly on coercive force firearms that are
than expensive toys by gutting the bill of rights cuz it just is not
progressive or does not fit in with modern thinking anymore

unbelievable

and i do believe amid the smoke confusion etc of a real riot situation
that it would be possible for a tank to get away with firing the main gun
into a building at close range  one would hear an explosion among many
explosions  it is loud but it is not going to stand out like a one thousand
pound bomb or a tactical nuke  there would be a hole blown in the wall
and some rubble but with tanks knocking over walls and other sources
of buildings turning into rubble and other covering racket such as
gunfire including fiftys tacking away it would not stand out that much
and could be explained by musta been a gas leak   i think it could be
done and not be reported under such conditions  it is possible  it is
not like a tank driving down a quiet street on a sunday afternoon turning
and firing you know  that would stand out and be pretty impossible
to cover up

dear friend
  the risc means reduced instruction set computer the risc usually has 
small instruction set so as to reduce the circuit complex and can increase 
the clock rate to have a high performance you can read some books about
computer architecture for more information about risc

hmm not that i am an authority on risc  but i clearly remember
reading that the instruction set on risc cpus is rather large
the difference is in addressing modes  risc instruction sets are not
as orthogonal is cisc

 

theoretically supposed to be reduced not any longer  that is why everyone
is arguing about risc vs cisc  personally i think cisc will win out
just take a look at the pentium  not that i like intel architectures either
but that is another story

bye


do you mean that the pentium is better than a risc  or that it will outsell
them all  if the first you have to remember that intel cisc like the
pentium are a always a generation away from the best riscs also riscs
cpu are more costly because they are not sold in the same quantities not
even on the same order  but i remember reading about three years maybe two

i may be a little dense but i would have thought that protecting consumers
from scam insurance companies would be the prime objective of something 
called the cal insurance commission if they are not accomplishing that now
then why do we need them

very simple  an insurance commissioner is a bureaucrat  a regulator
it is hisher duties to make rules to enforce laws  heshe cannot
make laws  if there is no law that covers a specific subject say
scam insurance companies a regulator cannot create one  so they have
to go to a proper legislative body to get such a law enacted  for
the california insurance commissioner there are two possible legislative
bodies  the california state legislature and the yous congress  we all
know how little the california state legislature accomplishes esp 
along the lines of insurance reform legislation negative movement  so
garamendi wants the feds to do it because a he has a better chance
of getting a federal law through and b since many of the scam
companies work across state linesnational borders it is better to

i have a togglebutton widget yes widget and i have a routine
which changes the color of the foreground and background of the
label  well the background changes alright but the label
text does not redraw itself

i am guessing that i have to force it to redraw with an
xexposeevent sent to it via xsendevent  is this the best
way to get the text up again  i cannot seeem to get
xsendevent to work right if this is a good approach
might anyone have an example lying around to show me how to
do this  i have rtfm all evening and did not find a decent
example

ps i keep getting segmentation faults in xsendevent though all
the values are as expected

thanks in advance

you could take a screw driver and hammer and start punching holes in

out then you would know that the oil drain plug is nearby within a foot
or two anyway close the holes with toilet paper before refileing with oil
though

you have to refill the engine with oil wow no wonder i cannot get
an engine to last more than my first oil change do not forget to
punch holes in the radiator too it will spray nice refreshing water

gee you really make me confused  what is radiator  where is it located
what does it look like  will it release any radiation since it sounds

north of seattle wa someone threw a rock of an overpass and hit our
windshield not by accident i am sure it was impossible to get up to the
overpass quickly to see who did it we figured it was kids reported it and
left
a couple of years ago it happend again and killed a guy at my company he was
in his midfourties and left behind a wife and children turned out there was
a reformatory for juviniles a few blocks away they caught the fourteen year old

  the wire feeding these outlets is twelvetwo without the ground

  wire was tied to the same bus as the neutral white wire

 this is contrary to the electrical code and should be fixed

well my house was built just last year and the breaker box is wired the
same way  

	there should be a connection of the ground wire to a ground
in the breaker box  there also should be a connection of the neutral
wire to a ground in the breaker box  there should be no other 
place in the building where such a connection occurs ie not in
any of the outlet boxes

	the neutral white wire is a grounding conductor for
the plug and is not safe to touch while the ground green
wire is a protective ground and carries no current unless
some kind of electrical fault has occurred  it is safe
to touch the protective ground but not to touch the 
grounding conductor because there is current in the grounding
conductor its outletbox end will not be at the same ground
potential as its breakerbox end

 you will have a hard time selling any sport to a community that
 cannot play it on account of availability or financial reasons
 hockey is pretty much a sport for the white and well off
 
 what white yes well off definitely not hockey season ticket owners have
 the lowest average income of any of the four major north american sports

do you have a basis for this claim  try these stats taken from playboy magazine

percentage of pro hackey fans who make more than fiftyk        fortyfourzero

 
 and think of where the majority of hockey players come from from a farm out
 in boondock saskatchewan or weedville alberta
 

the biggest advantage that kids from boondock or weedville have is the
availability of ice  in the san jose area we have a population of eight hundredzero
and that population is served by two ice arenas  in contrast kamloops
british columbia has a population of about fiftyzero and has five rinks  there
are also myriad ponds pools etc that freeze in the winter  down here
it is hard to find a kid without a bicycle up there it is hard to find a kid
without a pair of skates  and before you say what does he know he is from
california let me say that i was born and raised in trail british columbia
a town of about eightzero with lots of ice in the winter  my father did radio
play by play for the local team the trail smokeaters who by  the way were
the last canadian team to win the world championship back in one thousand nine hundred and sixtyone  i was
on skates almost as soon as i could walk and have been playing recreational
hockey for about thirtyfive years

 when was the last time you saw a hockey league in the inner city
 the insurance alone is a big enough barrier
 
 the inner city is not the only place that is poor
 i think the biggest barrier to hockey in the inner city is no ice to play on


lack of ice is a big factor but costs is a bigger factor  both my kids play for
the santa clara valley hockey association and this season which just ended
cost me seventyfive per kid for membership in hockey usa plus seven hundred and fifty per kid for club
dues  the hockey usa fees cover excess medical insurance and the club dues
cover ice time officials trophies etc  other areas have similar fees unless
the city government subsidises some of the costs as stockton does

by the way most ice arenas are located in what could be called the inner city
areas  eastridge and vallco are exceptions  redwood citys rink is in an
industrial area on bay rd near one hundred and one berkeleys is near ashby and martin luther
king stocktons is in oak park sacramentos is in an older section of downtown
i forget the name of the street fresnos is out on the edge of town just west
of ninetynine  santa rosas is a nice rink but it is in an older section of town
dublins is outside of town off five hundred and eighty  most of the rinks are old and expensive
to run with huge electric bills and insurance premiums  if you want to buy ice
time expect to pay around one hundred per hour at any of these rinks  some of them
give you a sixty minute hour for your money others give you a fifty minute hour and
include the resurfacing time in the fee

stuff deleted


excuse me but i understood what mr smith meant  and i have often observed 
when traffic is blocked solid that if a few people yeild to the moron
who is impatiently riding bumpers the slug at the front of the pack will
miraculously wake up change lanes and viola no more jam  granted the
situation here does not apply to rush hour in a crowded city  but i have
observed this situation regularly on your average interstate six or 
eight sets of cars side by side bunched up in a pack with open 
freeway fore and aft as far as you can see  the people who refuse to
yeild as a point of honor are just as annoying as the slug in the front

i agree that if traffic is all blocked up and you want to pass you might
not feel like moving over for someone behind you because you do not want to
give them that one carlength when they should just wait like you are
but if you are one of those people that just sits behind the person and
does not flash them with the high beams or pull left and flash them or
ride their bumper or otherwise tell them that you do in fact want to 
go by and you are not just drafting them then get the hell out of the 
way of someone who will  i especially hate it when you flash someone at
the back of a line and they do not pass it on  

so after i have flashed my lights at the chap in front and he does not
pass it on and few if any do what next on major highways three or more
lanes in each direction keeping to the extreme right blocks folks who
are entering also as someone posted in this thread here in the dc
area we have a few left lane exits sounds like sixtysix if you wait until
the last minute to get in the left lane you will not because these yoyos
will not make room

we have a particularly bad strech here in merryland just over the cabin
john bridge there are two very long entry ramps which all the hurryup
yahoos dive into because they want to get ahead when we get to the point
where these ramps merge all hell breaks lose the result is that traffic
which was moving at fiftyfive on the va side of the bridge stalls on tother
side if these dingbats had stayed in lane allowed the folks coming up
the two ramps to merge we would still be doing fiftyfive instead we do start
stop for four miles dave barrys idea of a laser equipped car would be
real useful here

bob

ps if you drive the beltway and want to merge look for a brown probe
with a silver haired driver then use your signals  i do not read minds
but i do try to be courteous they told me courtesy was contagious but
i guess the folks around here have had their shots

 iftccutalkpoliticsguns  vincentcadgatechedu vincent fox  tenthirtyfour am  apr fourteen one thousand nine hundred and ninetythree 

this is not recguns so maybe this is getting a bet technical but i
cannot resist

  a revolver also has the advantage that if it misfires you just pull
   the trigger again

sometimes  depends on why it misfired

  a doubleaction revolver almost all of them can be handcocked first
   but will fire merely by pulling the trigger

i cannot imagine doing much combat type shooting single action

  a misfire in a revolver merely means you must pull the trigger again
   to rotate to the next round

assuming the cylinder will rotate

  a revolver can be carried with the sixth chamber empty and under the
   hammer for maximum safety but still can be drawn and fired with an
   easy motion even one handed

never hurts to err on the side of safety but if you have got one of those
new fangled hammer blocks or transfer bar safeties it is unnecessarily
redundant  i would rather have the extra round

  speedloaders for a revolver allow reloads almost as fast as magazines
   on semiautos can be faster depending on users

quite true  speed loaders are a little less convenient to pack around
than magazines though

  a misfire in a semiauto will require you to clear a jammed she will
   first time spent which can be fatal and a vital second or so is often
   lost as you realize hey it is jammed before starting to do anything
   about clearing it

true but this is a training function

  most semiautos must have the slide worked to chamber the first round
   and cock the hammer some police carry their semiautos with the
   chamber loaded and hammer cocked but a safety engaged i do not consider
   this safe however you must tradeoff safety to get the same speed
   of employment as a revolver

cocked and locked for single actions or hammer down on double actions
are the only carry modes that make sense  the eighty series colts for
example are quite safe to carry this way

  there are some doubleaction semiautos out there but the complexity of
   operation of many of them requires more training

agreed

now that i have shot off my mouth a bit let me back some of this up  it
is true that a simple misfire on a revolver does not cost you much  on
the other hand i have had all sorts of interesting things happen over the
years  for example i have had factory ammunition that has had high
primers  a high primer will tie your revolver up somewhere from seconds
to minutes while you try to pound the action open to clear the problem
an auto  jack the slide and continue

i have had bullets come out of the case keeping the cylinder from
turning see clearing paragraph above  about the worst that can happen
with a semi auto is a double feed  this can be cleared in seconds

most revolvers are more fragile then semi autos  there are all sorts
of close tolerance parts and fitting involved  dropping the gun or a
blow to the gun or all sorts of things can take it out of action  many
of the problems that can be cured on the spot with a quality semi auto
take a gun smith for a revolver  in short a revolver may be less likely
to malfunction but as a rule when it does you are out of the fight
the majority of malfunctions that occur with semi autos does not fall
into that category

vincint makes many good points in this post but leaves off the opposing
view of most of them  a real good starting place is ayoobs the semi
auto pistol for police and self defense

in general i would agree the revolver is an excellent first gun and self
defense weapon for somebody that does not have the time and inclination
that is necessary for the training and practice needed to use a semi
auto effectively as a self defense arm

most cops are notoriously indifferent to firearms  if the department
is not going to train them they are not going to take the time on their
own  there is no doubt that training is an issue  the amount of
training required for effective use of a semi auto is probably several
times that of a revolver  many cops do not bother

for myself i would hate to be limited to one or the other  i would rather pick
what fits better with my personal inclination what i am wearing that day
and so on  like the moderator on recguns says buy them all

that said i have to admit that often my advice to people thinking of
buying their first defense arm is right after taking a class get a
ruger or smith revolver  sorry colt fans  colt revolvers are ok
too

if this post had gone the other way i would be arguing for revolvers

afs
afs     armenians killed turksturks killed armenians
afs
afs     simple as that can anybody deny these facts

jews killed germans in wwii  germans killed jews in wwii but there was 
quite a difference in these two statements regardless of what nazi 
revisionists say

sy my grand parents were living partly in todays armenia and partly in
sy todays georgia there were villages kurdturk different turkic groups
sy georgian muslimchristian armenian and farsi very near to eachother
sy the people living there were aware of their differences they were 
sy different people for example my grandfather would not have been happy 
sy if his doughter had willed to marry an armenian guy but that did not 
sy mean that they were willing to kill eachother no they were neighbors

ok

sy armenians killed turks which armenians their neoghbors as far as my
sy grandparents are concerned the armenians attacked first but these 
sy armenians were not their neighbors they came from other places maybe 
sy first they had a training at some place they were taught to kill people
sy to hate turkskurds it seems so

there is certainly a difference between the planned extermination of the
armenians of eastern turkey beginning in one thousand nine hundred and fifteen with that of the armeno
georgian conflicts of late one thousand nine hundred and eighteen the argument is not whether armenians ever 
killed in their collective existence but rather the wholesale destruction of
anatolian armenians under orders of the turkish government an armenian
georgian dispute over the disposition of akhalkalak lori and pambak after
the turkish third army evacuated the region cannot be equated with the
extermination of anatolian armenians many armenians and georgians died
in this area in the scramble to reoccupy these lands and the lack of
preparation for the winter months this is not the same as the turkish 
genocide of the armenians nearly four years earlier hundreds of kilometers
away

sy anyway but after they killedraped turks and other muslim people
sy around people assumed that armenians killed us raped our women
sy not a particular group of people trained in some camps maybe backed
sy by some powerful states after that step you cannot explain these 
sy people not to hate all armenians 

i do not follow perhaps the next paragraph will she would some light

sy so what am i trying to point out first at least for that region
sy you cannot blame turkskurds etc since it was a self defense situation
sy most of the armenians i think are not to blame either but since some
sy people started that fire it is not easy to undo it there are facts
sy people cannot trust eachother easily it is very difficult to establish
sy a good relation based on mutual respect and trust between nations with
sy different ethnicculturalreligious backgrounds but it is unfortunately
sy very easy to start a fire

again the fighting between armenians and georgians in one thousand nine hundred and eighteennineteen had little to
do with the destruction of the armenians in turkey it is interesting that
the georgian leaders of the transcaucasian federation armenia azerbaijan 
and georgia made special deals with turkish generals not to pass through 
tiflis on their way to baku in return for georgians not helping the armenians 
militarily of course as turkish troops marched across what was left of
caucasian armenia many armenians went north and such population movement 
caused problems with the locals this is in no comparison with events four years 
earlier in eastern anatolia my fathers mothers family escaped cemiskezek  
erzinka  erzerum  nakhitchevan  tiflis  constantinople  
massachusetts 

sy my grandparents were not bloodthirsty people we did not experience
sy what they had to endure they had to leave their lands there were
sy ladies old ladies all of her children killed while she forced to
sy witness young women put dirt at their face to make themselves
sy unattractive i do not want to go into any graphic detail

my grandmothers brother was forced to dress up as a kurdish women and paste
potato skins on his face to look ugly the turks would kill any armenian
young man on sight in dersim because their family was rather influential
local kurds helped them escape before it was too late this is why i am alive 
today

sy you may think that my sources are biased they were biased in some sense
sy they experienced their own pain of course that is the way it is  but
sy as i said they were living in peace with their neighbors before why 
sy should they become enemies

 in article eight thousand nine hundred and ninetyfourbluecispittedu travenpittedu neal traven writes

one also has to separate offense into batting and baserunning with the
split probably somewhere around fortyninefive and zerofive

 i would give baserunning a little more credit than that maybe fortyfivefive or
 even fortyten give a team of roberto alomar and a team of john oleruds
 identical batting stats which would not be that unreasonable and
 even if you do not let roberto steal a single base they will score a lot
 more than the oleruds by going firsttothird more often no offense
 gordon

i would not give baserunning that much value

the above effect is clear but there are other effects as well  if
olerud hits a double any runner on first will score if alomar legs an
extra base onto a hit in the gap the runner on first may need to hold
at third  thus oleruds doubles have more advancement value than
alomars  of course alomar is more likely to score after hitting a
double

another reason not to give too much extra value to baserunning is that
the runs created formulas work for very fast and very slow teams  no
team in the one thousand nine hundred and fiftys ran much but some teams certainly had faster players
than others  still the current runs created formulas work just as well
in the one thousand nine hundred and fiftys for all teams  

bill james gives the one thousand nine hundred and fiftyfiveone thousand nine hundred and fiftyeight senators as an example  they used harmon
killebrew regularly as a pinch runner and in one thousand nine hundred and fiftyseven stole thirteen bases with
thirtyeight times caught stealing  yet they scored slightly more runs than
predicted by runs created

subject re morality was re  keithccocaltechedu keith allan schneider writes
 liveseysolntzewpdsgicom jon livesey writes
 
 explain to me
 how instinctive acts can be moral acts and i am happy to listen
 for example if it were instinctive not to murder
 
 then not murdering would have no moral significance since there
 would be nothing voluntary about it
 
 see there you go again saying that a moral act is only significant
 if it is voluntary  why do you think this

if you force me to do something am i morally responsible for it

 
 and anyway humans have the ability to disregard some of their instincts

well make up your mind    is it to be instinctive not to murder
or not

 
 so only intelligent beings can be moral even if the bahavior of other
 beings mimics theirs
 
 you are starting to get the point  mimicry is not necessarily the 
 same as the action being imitated  a parrot saying pretty polly 
 is not necessarily commenting on the pulchritude of polly
 
 you are attaching too many things to the term moral i think
 let us try this  is it good that animals of the same species
 do not kill each other  or do you think this is right 

it is not even correct    animals of the same species do kill
one another

 
 or do you think that animals are machines and that nothing they do
 is either right nor wrong

sigh   i wonder how many times we have been round this loop

i think that instinctive bahaviour has no moral significance
i am quite prepared to believe that higher animals such as
primates have the beginnings of a moral sense since they seem
to exhibit selfawareness

 
 
 animals of the same species could kill each other arbitarily but 
 they do not
 
 they do  i and other posters have given you many examples of exactly
 this but you seem to have a very short memory
 
 those were not arbitrary killings  they were slayings related to some 
 sort of mating ritual or whatnot

so what     are you trying to say that some killing in animals
has a moral significance and some does not   is this your
natural morality


 
 are you trying to say that this is not an act of morality because
 most animals are not intelligent enough to think like we do
 
 i am saying
 	there must be the possibility that the organism  it is not 
 	just people we are talking about  can consider alternatives
 
 it is right there in the posting you are replying to
 
 yes it was but i still do not understand your distinctions  what
 do you mean by consider  can a small child be moral  how about
 a gorilla  a dolphin  a platypus  where is the line drawn  does
 the being need to be self aware

are you blind   what do you think that this sentence means

	there must be the possibility that the organism  it is not 
	just people we are talking about  can consider alternatives

what would that imply

 
 what do you call the mechanism which seems to prevent animals of
 the same species from arbitrarily killing each other  do not
 you find the fact that they do not at all significant

i find the fact that they do to be significant

        and as far as fullyautomatic weapons you can be a lot better
 armed if you want to hit what you aim at
 
 what seems to be happening here is the situation getting totally blown out of
 proportion  in my post i was referring to your regular patrolman in a car
 cruising around the city vs gang members  of course the police have access
 to the things that you mentioned but do they use tanks and such all of the
 time  of course they do not and that is the point i was trying to make  every
 day when i go out to lunch i always see cops coming in  the majority that i
 see are still carrying revolvers  not that there is anything wrong with a
 revolver but if you are a cop that is up against some gang member with a couple
 of automatics in his coat i mean semiauto handguns you are going to be at a
 disadvantage even with training  i have been at a shooting range where gang
 gang members were practicing shooting  they were actually practicing
 taking out their guns as quick as possible and shooting at the target
 and they were not doing too badly either   the university cops here who are
 are state cops are armed better than the chicago police  it seems most
 state cops are

every city and suburban police officer i have seen around the twin cities in the
last two years has carried a semiauto of some type different brands though
i have not seen any glocks 

with regard to this discussion  we are getting dangerously far from the usual
rantings of tpg and close to the realm of rg but i would like to put my two
cents worth in  while there is nothing wrong with a revolver especially a 
large frame sw in three hundred and fiftyseven magnum  my favorite there are valid advantages to
semiautos  i suggest reading massad ayoobs i know some people cannot stand
him and think he is full of bull but i think that in general his material is
very valid and useful book the semi auto pistol in police work or something 
like that  he defines a number of ways that semiautos are different and that
different is good  the main advantage is not in increased firepower but in 
more accurate followup shots when you go to single action mode  there is also a
certain propriatory nature of each gun that takes some familiarity to 
learn  this may have diminished with time as more criminals become familiar
with different models of semiautos but it was cited as stopping or at least
slowing down criminals who had grabbed a police officers gun

 
 define armed better go shoot a revolver and a semiauto like the
 colt fortyfive does one fires faster than the other nope aside from which
 faster rate of fire is usually not desirable sure it makes the other
 guys duck for cover but just you trying hitting anything with a thompson
 in hosemode this is why the military is limiting it is msixteen now to
 threeround burstfire simple semiauto would be better but the troops
 like to be able to rock and roll even if it is wasteful of ammo something
 often in short supply when the enemy is plentiful
 
 a revolver is equally capable as a semiauto in the same caliber
 
  a revolver also has the advantage that if it misfires you just pull
   the trigger again
  a doubleaction revolver almost all of them can be handcocked first
   but will fire merely by pulling the trigger

yes but this is best done with a two hand hold  with a single hand you either
pull the gun far off target to cock or must fire double action  the da semi
auto has the same advantages plus is always sa after the first shot


  a misfire in a revolver merely means you must pull the trigger again
   to rotate to the next round

i am not sure if this is meant to be different from your first point  in a da
semiauto you can pull the trigger again to try dropping the hammer on the same
round  an advantage you do not have in a revolver where the next trigger pull will
always go to the next round discussing this point now  this is fine with a dud
but what about a hangfire situation  granted it is very rare but your round will
now go off confined in the cylinder with no place to go  slingshotting the slide
on a misfire takes very little time


  a revolver can be carried with the sixth chamber empty and under the
   hammer for maximum safety but still can be drawn and fired with an
   easy motion even one handed

actually with modern revolver designs incorporating hammer blocks this is not
necessary or usually recommended  a revolver would have to fall hard enough and
at the right angle to actually break the hammer and driver the firing pin into the
round to set it off

  speedloaders for a revolver allow reloads almost as fast as magazines
   on semiautos can be faster depending on users

the best speedloader users especially those using the spring loaded speed
loaders are very fast  a problem is that ejecting the spent cases is a two
handed job where dropping the expended magazine is one handed  this means that
while you can be inserting a fresh magazine as soon as the old one clears the
gun with a speed loader you have to go through more motions that will always 
take more time  you also do not have the advantage of tactical reloads replacing
a partial magazine to bring you back to full capacity  the partial magazine can
still be used if needed later  

 
  a misfire in a semiauto will require you to clear a jammed she will
   first time spent which can be fatal and a vital second or so is often
   lost as you realize hey it is jammed before starting to do anything
   about clearing it

yes the time to recognize the problem is just as important as the time to clear
it  really though in either a revolver or semiauto the odds of an actual misfire
with factory ammo are awfully small  you are more likely to get a jam in a semiauto
but even these are exceptionally rare with modern quality guns sigs glocks etal


  most semiautos must have the slide worked to chamber the first round
   and cock the hammer some police carry their semiautos with the 
   chamber loaded and hammer cocked but a safety engaged i do not consider
   this safe however you must tradeoff safety to get the same speed
   of employment as a revolver

  there are some doubleaction semiautos out there but the complexity of
   operation of many of them requires more training

all common semiautos can be carried with a round in their chamber without any
safety problems  while i put that out as a statement that i believe i should
say that this applies to all of the ones i have looked at  for the da semis it is
no different from the revolver situation  the guns all have hammer or firing
pin blocks  they also have a safety  because there is no real advantage
carrying one of these cocked and locked you have the same safety and speed
of employment as a revolver plus the advantage of sa followup shots  i am
not familiar with sa semiautos except for the one thousand nine hundred and elevenaone  i admit that i was
initially skeptical about carrying this cocked and locked but after examining
the design trying to defeat the safeties gun unloaded of course and 
shooting it a lot i see no inherent safety problems with it especially in
a thumbreak holster with the strap under the hammer  this design also gets
you more speed for an accurate first shot than a revolver

 
 some police departments switched to glocks and then started quietly
 switching many officers back to the old revolvers too many were having
 accidents partly due to the poor training they received not that glocks
 require rocket scientists but some cops are baffled by something as complex
 as the timer on a vcr

yeah the infamous glock  i still cannot figure out how it is worse than a revolver
for safety  if you do not pull the trigger it does not go off  i imagine that if all
your revolver shooting was done double action then you could pull the glock trigger
far enough to fire before you realized it  in addition if you had developed that
nasty habit of keeping your finger on the trigger when holstering your gun and
relying on your thumb on the hammer to remind you to take it off before you blew
off your foot then you would have problems when the hammer was not there

 
 anyone who goes anyone saying that the criminals obviously outgun
 the police do not know nothing about firearms turn off cops and hunter
 and pay attention i do not seek here to say semiautos are junk
 merely that assuming they are better for all jobs is stupid a cop
 with a revolver on his hip and a shotgun in the rack is more than
 equipped for anything short of a riot

i think this is even okay for a riot as long as it is a small one b

 
 gun control is hitting what you aim at if you whip out a 
 wondernine and fire real fast you may find you do not hit anything
 good controlled fire from a revolver is more likely to get you a hit
 i own a ninemm beretta myself but consider it inferior as a carry weapon
 to something like the ruger security six revolver if i have not hit
 what i am aiming at in the first five shots something is quite seriously
 wrong somewheres while i might like having the backup capacity of those
 extra shots in certain cases overwhelmingly the  of shots fired in
 criminal encounters is less than five

i have the poor mans beretta taurus ninetynine and consider it inferior as a carry
weapon to the springfield fortyfive oops ninemm vs fortyfive arguments are relegated to
rg  you are right though  if you do not hit what you aim at then the
shootergun combination has failed  i do not ascribe failures in the the
fire real fast with a wondernine scenario you mention to the gun  this is
a shooter failure whether through lack of discipline or lack of training


 
 what do crooks overwhelmingly use in crime why the same nice simple
 thirtyeight revolvers that the police often use well actually some police 
 prefer the much heftier three hundred and fiftyseven magnum but anyway

ninemms are becoming more popular with crooks too though the thirtyeight does still
lead the list  and like i said around here semiautos seem the rule for the
street cop  do not know about the state patrol however they may still carry
the highway patrolman

 
 obplea do not flame me i prefer semiautos for most things but they 
         introduce unneccessary complications to something as nervewracking
         as an abrupt encounter with a lone criminal

vincent please do not take any of this as a flame  just my zerotwo whoops looks more

 scsione complient and tends to be implimented as a very fast scsione since it 
 needs a different controller interface in both hardware which tends to be 
 very expendsive and software  transfer speeds are foursixmbs with tenmbs burst 
 eightbit eighttwelvembs with twentymbs burst sixteenbit and fifteentwentymbs with fortymbs burst
 thirtytwobitwide and fast  scsitwo in scsione mode is limited to seven devices and
 reduced eightbit or sixteenbit fast only throughput due to the difference between
 scsione and wide scsitwo ports

ibm
hd interfaces limited to hard drives by design or lack of development

ide  integrated device electronics 
 currently the most common standard and is mainly used for medium sized 
 drives can have more than one hard drive asynchronous transfer fivembs max

so at its lowest setting scsitwo interface in asynchronous scsione mode averages 
the through put maximum of ide in asynchronous mode  in full scsitwo mode
it blows poor ide out the window down the street and into the garbage can
the problem becomes can the drive mechanisim keep up with those through put
rates and that is where the bottleneck and cost of scsitwo comes from  not
the interface itself but more and more from drive mechanisims to use the
scsitwo through put  the cost of scsi interface is a self fulliling
prophisy few people buy scsi because it is so expencive for the pc which
in turn convices makes that mass producing scsi which would reduce its
cost is unwarented and so scsi is expencive that is the effect of the
rule of scale the more items sold the less each item has to bare the brunt
the cost of manufacture and so the less each item has to cost

scsitwo allows a drive mechanisims through put to be limited by the drive while
ide itself limits the through put

 some limitation  let me guess  do not use the code in any way pkp or
 rsa does not likesuch asproviding secure communications for the

that was exactly its purpose if you know anything about it  there is
nothing at all preventing the average citizen using it only selling
it

fact  it is unlawful to distribute code implementing rsa without a license
to do so from pkp whether or not one is charging for it  furthermore
any use of rsa other than for research purposes allowed under us patent
law is similarly unlawful  therefore the average citizen cannot use
rsa to encrypt message traffic in the us without a license from pkp

there is no licensed freely available product in the us that uses rsa
encryption other than rsaref and hence ripem at least as far as i am
aware  if you know of another please post it here

 all i have to say isyeah right  if you are willing to pay them
 mucho big bucks andor use the routines they tell you to do  
 does not sound very reasonable to me

all i have to say is this is full of shit  i have negotiated a license
and the bucks are incredibly reasonable with an upfront charge on a
sliding scale depending on your capitalization  if you are a startup
and cannot afford it you cannot afford to start up in the first place
why do people insist on making unequivocal statements about that which
they know nothing

fact  the last contact i had with rsa data security inc was with some
guy trying to sell me a license unsolicited i might add for tipem
cost fifteenk plus twofive percent royalties

i suppose it is a matter of opinion as to whether or not these terms count
as mucho bucks or incredibly reasonable  either way however this
definitely falls into the routines they tell you to use

 but i do not guess pkp and rsa are interested in big bucks  maybe
 they have some other agenda  secure communications only for 
 government agents perhaps

have you considered treatment for paranoia  the government is the
single biggest thorn in rsas side

fact  there are no restrictions yet on the use of cryptography under
us law although this is beginning to look like it will change  the only
impediments to widespread use of rsa cryptography in the us are pkps
patents

true nine hundred and fourteen enthusiasts will be able to give you a better answer then this
but i will dump my impressions  i have wanted to own a nine hundred and fourteen for about ten years
now came close once but i ended up buying a fiero instead biggest mistake
of my life

anyway for four thousand you should be able to get a nice car but your also set
in the price range to get taken by a nice looker that is a pile of shit
the most common total failure for the car would be frame rust between the
engine and passenger compartment  also look for chassis welded together
here  oh yeah the price range you are talking about must be the four banger
a six if you could find one would be mucho more bucks

parts for the engine are pretty easy to come by for an old car and you
can even locate crude in the jc whitney catalog if you have too

the machine itself is pretty simple they use the spare tire for windshild
washer instead of a pump fer chris sake so getting it fixed by a good
bugporsche mechanic would be easy  since it is midengine you may spend
more on labor for any mechanical work

summary spit out the lukewarm


in article  mlspanixcom michael siemon writes
 well the whole point of making these the base commandments is that
 they are not reducible to rules  a set of rules is a moral code or a
 law code or an algorithm for acting  such things can be very helpful
 to individuals or societies  but not if they are used instead of a
 personal involvement in and responsibility for ones actions 

the two commandments are rules they are merely rules that are
so vague that they are practically devoid of meaning  michael
siemon acknowledges this every time he writes that the resolution
of an argument over them turns on secular and cultural
assumptions that are independent of these rules
 
  the great  commandment is more than anything else a call
 to act as if you were god and accepting ultimate responsibility
 in your every action 

the commandment to love your neighbor as yourself can be viewed
in part as reminding man that he is not god and cannot act as if
he has ultimate responsibility indeed many traditions present
an interpretation where believers are supposed to interpret
loving ones neighbor as following various other rules and
relying on their god to make things come out right precisely
because it would be wrong for man to assume such ultimate
responsibility once again we are confronted with good sounding
goo that means whatever the reader wants it to mean 

  conservatives may twist this act as if you were god to 
 mean lay down rules for other people and be as nasty to them
 as possible if they do not keep your rules  they are so
 insistent and obvious about this that they have convinced a
 lot of people who rightly reject the whole concept that such 
 idiocy is how god acts 

and who is to say that this interpretation is twisted  there
are many passages in the bible that in their most straightforward
reading show the christian god behaving in just this way
michael cannot refer to base claims or base commandments to
show that such readings are twisted because this divergence in
understanding occurs even in trying to interpret the base
claims and commandments  in addressing conservative christians
michael will necessarily draw upon secular and cultural notions
that these conservative christians will reject  

 but why should anyone be looking for an ethical system since our
 society is eager to hand us one or more no matter what we do  it
 may be that we need a principle for the critique of ethical systems
  in which case i will profer the agapate allelou once again

but these base commandments are too vague to serve as  a
principle for the critique of ethical systems the meaning of
these base commandments for any believer derives from the secular
and cultural notions that the believer brings to them from how
the believer mixes their demands with straightforward readings of
other biblical passages from a particular sectarian tradition
or from some combination of these things  these commandments
lack sufficient substance in themself to serve as a basis for
criticizing ethical systems  what meaning they have comes from
the ethical system the believer brings to these commandments 

 and different bodies of christians have from the beginning urged
 different ethical systems or in some cases none  as a result
 it is bizarre to identify any one of these systems however popular
 or infamous with christianity  christianity does not have a torah
 it does not have a quran  specifically christian scripture has very
 little if anything in the way of commandments  so little that
 the christians who desperately want commandments go mining for
 them with almost no support  the one single thing in the gospels
 which jesus specifically gives as a commandment to us is love
 one another

jesus explicitly states that this summarizes jewish law which
would seem to bring in all of it if we properly understand what
it means to love god and love our neighbors  there are many
parables and teachings the gospels attribute to jesus that are
straightforwardly read as ethical commandments  the pauline
epistles are similarly full  if it is not clear that these all
come together in a sensible understanding of ethical behavior
the problem is not a lack of raw material 


 i am a radical christian only in that i take the gospel seriously

no michael the conservative christians also take the gospel 
seriously  what differentiates you is the way you interpret the
gospel

  why do not i and the myriads of other christians like me
 tell you something about christianity 

in a sense the wide variety of interpretations does tell us
something about christianity  it tells us that the new testament
authors left a sufficiently vague hodgepodge that it can serve
as the source text for many vastly different beliefs about the
nature of the christian god and about what men should and
should not do 

the irony here is that there is nothing in christianity per
se that michael can use to support the because of lesbians and
gays  every christian principle he turns to this because is
effective only through the extrachristian principles through
which michael interprets his religion and the homophobes apply
the same christian principles with equal justification to
their because  in short it is the extrachristian principles that
make michaels christianity beneficial and i suspect they would
be as beneficial perhaps moreso without being filtered by
christian interpretation  

michael paints a picture of standard american atheism as the
rejection of the evil in many conservative christian
interpretations of the bible  but i think it is even more
damaging to christianity to note that the new testament presents
such a vague hodgepodge of notions about the nature of god and
the nature of the good except of course when it is ordered by
an interpretation that relies on extraneous principles  here i
think we should apply a christian parable where a cold drink can
have its value and a hot drink can have its value but the
lukewarm we should spit out

does xdm work with decnet i have an ultrix machine running both tcpip
and decnet i have a number of xterminals hanging off the ultrix host also
running tcpip and decnet presently i am using xdm for the login procedure
on the xterminals using tcpip since xdm is basically just an xwindows
client should not i be able to run xdm on the decnet protocol tower as well


xdm is not just an x window client  xdm has its own protocol xdmcp that
operates of ucp on port one hundred and seventyseven  it does provide a login window which is an
x window client  as to using decnet protocol  looking through the source
for xdm from xelevenrfive that i have here it seems that the bare bones code is
there but not completely there


my first inclination is that xdm is not your typical x client it is making
tcpip specific socket calls in this case the answer would be no you can
not run xdm over decnet is this right or not any feedback is appreciated
thanks


from my look at the source it seems you cannot run it over decnet as shipped
with xelevenrfive

hello

i am testing a port of xelevenrfive to coherent a unix clone os for intel architecture
machines  i am seeing a strange problem with text in clients like xvt a simple
terminal emulator program

the problem manifests it self when the she will echoes typed characters back to the
server for display one at a time  the characters appear to be too closely
spaced with the result being that the twond character echoed destroys the 
rightmost edge of the first character then the threerd character destroys the 
rightmost edge of the second character and so on  it looks like there is an
invisible boundary around a character which obscures a portion of the previous
character  there is no problem between the characters when the she will returns
a complete line of text only when the output is a series of individual
characters

if anyone has any ideas what the problem might be or where i should look to
find it it would be much appreciated

lines one hundred and fortythree

in article seven thousand eight hundred and sixtytwobluecispittedu geneticpittedu david m tate writes
mssnetcomcom mark singer said

i meant that one should not let the exception make the rule  

it is not an exception  good players come up young most players who come
up young will be good  this has always been the rule


are most players who come up young always good when they are young or
later

worse it is not a shift  this is the way it has always been  several
detailed studies of this have been done and they have all shown that players
are not coming up any younger or older than in the past and they are not 
playing any more or less in the minors than they used to  the only thing
that shifts is our memories of the good old days 

damn  i was afraid you would say that


but all after the fact which makes it not applicable to the current
discussion which is about how you decide whether to play the rookie who
has not established himself in the majors over the mediocre veteran  the
padres played santiago that year because they clearly had nobody else worth
playing  

well perhaps if the braves had no one else worth playing this year it
would be lopez in there  but they do have others worth playing at
least in their opinion  and i happen to agree


both of these young men were highly touted defensive catchers
expected to be among the best ever in baseball  

not by recsportbaseball consensus  that may sound like an incredibly
arrogant comment but i have found that the sdcn consensus when one exists
is right far more often than the media consensus or the opinions of baseball
people affiliated with mlb  

i can believe that  i am a newbie here so i will take your word  but
alomar is a fine defensive catcher which was my statement above
that is a solid reason for bringing him up at a tender age as long
as they feel he can also hit a bit  lopez does not have such a
consensus about his defensive prowess and imho that is enough to
give him that dreaded seasoning


i do not know who knows  i suppose the same people or similar who
know he will be better than some other catcher  these are of 
course just differing opinions  i read that his arm is not that
strong i suppose somewhere there is some measurement of sb ratios
and that he is still learning to call a game  that latter skill may
be difficult to project on someone without an intimate knowledge of
his performance but it is a tangible skill

i disagree in that i do not think it is a tangible skill any more than
leadership is  i do not deny that it is a real skill and that some catchers
may be much better than others at it but i really do not see any way that we
could ever know who they are  nicholss law of catcher defense is eerily
accurate far too often for me to take defensive assessments of catchers very
seriously

sorry  new  do not know nichols law  do not believe in catchers
era  but i am interested in pitchers eras with different catchers
any info on that



absolutely  the evidence is piling up year after year  the only other
alternative is that the braves really do not know that their young players
are on average better than their current starters  i am not ruling out that
kind of gross incompetence but i think the salaryschedule explanation is
more charitable

in other words we know more than they do so the only logic behind 
a different decision than we would make must be financial  i presume
we feel this way about other franchises than atlanta no


consider we know that the braves are about the strongest team in baseball
right now even with olson and lemke and nixon and bream in the lineup  they
have as good a chance of repeating as champs this year as any team ever has
it actually makes some sense to say rather than making our team marginally
better this year by bringing up the young studs and dumping the elderly let us
go ahead and compete this year with what we have and then bring up the studs
only as we have to so that we will still have them under reserve three years
from now and beyond when the current team will be collecting pensions

is it fair to the young players  no  does it make organizational sense 
i think it does

well if it does make organizational sense one can hardly fault them
for their decisions  i mean please do not tell me how to run my
business  especially when i am being successful


 c	i could make it one hundred and seven or one hundred and eight wins if you let me bring up lopez

s	listen bobby  i would like to  but the way i see it if he hits
	the big club this year we will be paying megaarbitration bucks
	down the road in a couple of years and there is no way i want
	to do that

and continues with

	we can win without him and then keep winning next year with him
	how is that

i am sure you could be right  you could also be smoking some illegal
substance

hey  that is a joke  do not get offended  please


hey i would love to be wrong about this  if you think it is unlikely i would love
to know why  do not cite anybodys innate ethical rectitude though unless
you know them personally


well i cannot cite anyones ethical rectitude because i do not know
what it means  

but again if it makes organizational sense then so be it  baseball
is a business and if there is a solid business reason for keeping
lopez on the farm then that is what the braves should do

i happen to believe that it is a baseball decision  while you from
your armchair may disagee i do not  i think there is a lot of
evidence to suggest the decision they made  i predicted it among
large guffaws from several at the start of spring training  i
think it is a very normal decision to have made  it is certainly
more reversible than to have started lopez in the bigs and have
released one of their catchers  sure it may be conservative  it
may also be logical  i do not know what ethics have to do with it
seems like pretty good common sense to me

	difficult to manage a largescale smuggling operation 
	the cops now rank just a narrow notch below the military

	in a similar vein the amount of marijuana smuggled into
	this country has greatly decreased this is because its
	valueperpound is very low when compared to cocaine or
	heroin it is simply not worth the risk it is uneconomical
	now most reefer is domestic there is less pressure on

	thus it is economical of note though  domestic reefer
	is now very strong so a small volume goes a long way
	you cannot make alcohol stronger than two hundred proof  not a

   many of these cereals are cornbased after your post i looked in the

a couple of folks have suggested the corn connection  in the five month
period between the two seizures my daughter had eaten a fair amount of
kix and berry berry kix in the mornings and never had a problem  i checked
the labels and the first ingredient is corn  she has also never had a problem
eating corn or corn on the cob but of course that is usually later in the day
with a full stomach so the absorption would not be so high  i do believe that
frost flakes have corn in them but i will have to check the fruit loops  but
the fact that she has eaten this other corny cereal in the morning makes me
wonder

look if you can figure out a reliable means of keeping guns away from
bad people while not interfering with good people i think we would all be
for it  the problem is the methods we are using now do not do the trick

do not manufacture them  do not sell them  do not import them

some guns will get through but far fewer and far less people will
die because of them  hunting weapons could be allowed of course as
long as they are big and bulky and require reloading after a few
shots how many times can you shoot at the same animal anyways one
assumes they are moving


first of all let us assume that you are right that fewer guns would make it 
in to the country that sounds great to those that see guns as inherently
evil except then every one  of those guns would be in the hands  of someone
who obviously could not care less about following the law after all they 
got the gun illegally so is more likely to commit a crime with that gun
great then everyone with a gun is likely to use it in a crime nice system

now  as to reducing the number of guns  coming into society by making it 
illegal to manufacture sell or import them in this coutry  let me use
a parallel for empiric evidence  the amount of cocaine in this country is
far less since its manufacture sale and importation was out lawwed    if
that last statement is true then perhaps we should consider your plan  this 
could also apply to drugs in general

 consider this the bds had more than one lamp the tanks made more than

 was a tank nearby
 
 the fact that it appears that fires started in several places does not
 rule out anything

i watched it live and have rewatched it several times and from the press  
vantage point there was only one starting point visible where the tank  
punched in on the windward side and the winds whipped that fire across the  
whole dry wooden structure in minutes  faned by the thirty mph gusts and the  
hueys   if there were other fires started they were not visible nor were  
they needed to cause the flame progression i observed
 
 also where are these several witnesses the way i heard it from the fbi
 spokesman on cnn the witnesses were all people driving the tanks
 
all witnesses get thier paychecks from the fbi

 one other point i am no fan of janet reno but i do like the way she had the

avoda ivrit  hebrew labor


hebrew labor is a concept which has served the zionist movement
for a long time  it has a doublebarreled message one the new jew
must learn to do physical labor ie working the land two the
land in this country must pass into jewish hands ie to the same
new jew who has learned to work it both aspects of the
twopronged concept of hebrew labor have racist connotations on
the one hand the diaspora jews lack of training in physical
labor is a myth shared by zionists and antisemites  on the other
hand its meaning in practice has been the displacement of the
arab farmer from the source of his livelihood

the occupation and the cheap palestinian labor which streamed from
the occupied territories to the factories orchards and
hothouses of israel relegated the myth of hebrew labor to the
history books and nostalgic memories of the zionist movement it
has blossomed forth anew however as the governments answer to
problems caused by the closure of the territories today too this
concept has two functions one to give a progressive look to the
closing of the palestinian population  or in the words of
environment minister yossi sarid i have no tears for those who
get rich off of cheap labor two to furnish an answer to the
unemployed israeli who complains of being obliged to work for
wages that are lower than the unemployment insurance he receives

the israeli government is considering plans to import labor from
the far east to replace native people palestinians who work in
their own country thus creating conflicting interests between two
ethnical communities and ruling over them

medicine is not a totally scientific endevour
 
the acquisition of scientific knowledge is completely scientific  the
application of that knowledge in individual cases may be more art than
science
 
there are diseases that have not been described yet and the root because
of many diseases now described are not known read a book on
gastroenterology sometime if you want to see a lot of them after
scientific methods have run out then it is the patients freedom of
choice to try any experimental method they choose and it is well
recognized by many doctors that medicine does not have all the answers
 
certainly we do not have all the answers  the question is what is the
most reliable means of acquiring further medical knowledge  the
scientific method has proven itself to be reliable  the only reason
alternative therapies are shunned by physicians is that their
practitioners refuse to submit their theories to rigorous scientific
scrutiny insisting that tradition or anecdotal evidence are
sufficient  these have been shown many times in the past to be very
unreliable ways of acquiring reliable knowledge  crooks ideas have
never been backed up by scientific evidence  his unwillingness to do
good science makes the rest of us doubt the veracity of his contentions

 twentyk on a sports car of some kind  after thinking about it i may have a
 better idea  i will keep the accord until it drops and buy the car i have
 always wanted  a corvette stingray my reasoning is that eight thousand accord
 eight thousand corvette sixteen thousand is less than what i would spend anyway
 
 basically i am thinking of a late seventys early eightys for around seventenk
 my question is what are good years to consider for reliability looks
 horsepower  in that order believe it or not horsepower is not a main
 concern if i want to go fast i get on my motorcycle and what are
 good prices
 
 also what would insurance look like  i am male single twentythree i might
 wait until i am twentyfive to get the car  lower insurance would the fact that
 i mainly drive the other car lower it  is there some type of classic
 car or rarely driven insurance class for driving it under tenk miles
 per year
 
     my dad has a sixtysix vette and its on what you say classic insurance
     basically what that means is that it has restricted amount of driving
     time which basically means it cannot be used as an every day car and would
     probably suit your needs for limited mileage
  

        in my area denver if you look around alittle you can get an
    one thousand nine hundred and eightyfour for tenzero or less not much less you said your not looking
    to go fast they are a really nice car just not real powerful
in addition to restricted mileage many classic insurance carriers also require
that the vehicle be garaged when not in use

stuff about the connection between ide and ida deleated
eightmhz clock sixteen bit width fivembsec
if ide speed come from ida where does the eightthreembs sighted for ide come from

scsi is not complex it is just the way the industry uses and talks about it
there are three key differences in scsi the controller chip the port and
the software  that is it
let us look as scsi in from this stand point

scsione asynchronous and synchronous modes software scsi driver only
 asynchronous is slower then synchronous mode only zerothreembs vs zerofivembs
 synchronous speeds can be reached by most scsione divices with a
 rewrite of the software driver as is the case for the mac quadra

scsitwo eightbit this is the main source for the confusion this differs from
 scsione only in the controler chip in most machines  in the mac and some pcs
 this is called fast scsione because it uses scsione ports and software drivers
 and can produce scsitwo speeds through scsione inspite of this even in the 
 slower asynchronous mode  average speed in asynchronous scsione mode 
 foursixmbs with eightmbssee in both quadras and higher end pcs synchronous
 mode just allows a higher burst rate tenmbs

scsitwo sixteenbit two versionswidefast  wide scsitwo requires two things
 over eightbit scsitwo  a scsitwo software driver and a wide scsi port on the
 machine and the external device
 fast scsitwo also requires two things over eightbit scsitwo scsitwo driver
 software and that the recieving devise support sixteenbit fast scsitwo
 speed of both is the same eighttwelvembs with twentymbs burst

scsitwo thirtytwobit  also know as wide and fast scsi  over eightbit scsitwo this
 requires scsitwo driver software wide scsitwo port and that the recieving
 devices also have a thirtytwobit mode scsitwo chip  as expected this is very
 expencive  speed fifteentwentymbs with fortymbs bursts
 

as i said simple  seven versions of scsi seperated by software the 
controler chip and the port standarize the software and it drops to
only five versions of scsi seperate by only hardware the chip and the port

clipper might be a good way to cover the use of another layer of
encryption

currently when you send an encrypted message an opponent can usually
tell one that you are using encryption two which encryption method you
are using because that information is usually in the clear

with clipper most opponents will only know that you are sending
clippertext they will not know that your clippertext is itself
encoded

only those few opponents who get your clipperkeys will know
that your message is double encrypted

 kind of like a safety deposit box containing a lock box

so do not just think of replacements for clipper also think of front

	when you have got hrh prince of wales saying stupid things over

let us assume for the moment that the system really is secure unless
you get both halves of the encryption key from the two independent
escrow houses  let us say you even trust the escrow houses  one is
the aclu and the other is the eff  and i am not entirely joking about
those two names

in that case the prince of wales has nothing to worry about on this
system  indeed as pointed out since the current systems even the
current digital systems are very easy to decode  right now anybody
with an old tv can hear them  for most people this will be viewed
as an oh goody step upwards

and look at how tolerant the public is  they are willing to let the
neighbours with the radios hear right now

it was suggested by one person that a lot of nonevidentiary wiretapping
is going on right now without warrants because anybody can do it and it is
just an ecpa violation  this would stop that  all tapping would need
a warrant or a breach of security at the escrow houses

in article  brooksbybrighamnosubdomainnodomain glen w brooksby writes
this past weekend a friend of mine lost his thirteen month old
daughter in a matter of hours to a form of menangitis  the
person informing me called it nicereal meningicocis sp
in retrospect the disease struck her probably sometime on 
friday evening and she passed away about twothirtypm on saturday
the symptoms seemed to be a rash that started small and
then began progressing rapidly she began turning blue
eventually which was the tipoff that this was serious
but by that time it was too late this is all second hand info

my question is
is this an unusual form of menangitis  how is it transmitted
how does it work ie how does it kill so quickly

there are many organisms viral bacterial and fungal which can
because meningitits and the course of these infections varies
widely the causes of bacterial meningitis vary with age in adults
pneumococcus the same organism which causes pneumococcal pneumonia
is the most common because while in children hemophilus influenzae
is the most common because

what you are describing is meningitis from neisseria meningitidis
which is the second most common because of bacterial meningitis in
both groups but with lower incidence in infants this organism
is also called the meningococcus and is the source of the
common epidemics of meningitis that occur and are popularized in
the press without prompt treatment and even with it in some cases
the organism typically causes death within a day 

this organism feared as it is is actually grown from the throats
of many normal adults it can get to the meninges by different
ways but blood borne spread is probably the usual case 

rifampin an oral antibiotic is often given to family and contacts
of a case of meningococcal meningitis by the way

reply to frankdtwelvessix hundred and fiftyeightuucp frank odwyer
 
i am one of those people who does not know what the word objective means
when put next to the word morality  i assume its an idiom and cannot
be defined by its separate terms
 
give it a try
 
objective morality is morality built from objective values
 
from a dictionary of philosophy by anthony flew
 
objectivism  the belief that there are certain moral truths that would
remain true whatever anyone or everyone thought or desired  for
instance no one should ever deliberately inflict pain on another
simply to take pleasure in his suffering might be thought of as a
plausible example  even in a world of sadists who all rejected it the
contention remains true just as five  seven  twelve remains correct even if
there is no one left to count  the problem for the objectivist is to
determine the status of moral truths and the method by which they can be
established  if we accept that such judgements are not reports of what
is but only relate to what ought to be see naturalistic fallacy then
they cannot be proved by any facts about the nature of the world  nor
can they be analytic since this would involve lack of actionguiding
content  one ought always to do the right thing is plainly true in
virtue of the vords involved but it is unhelpful as a practical guide to
action see analytic and synthetic  at this point the objectivist may
talk of selfevident truths but can he deny the subjectivists claim
that selfevidence is in the mind of the beholder  if not what is left
of the claim that some moral judgements are true  the subjectivist may
well feel that all that remains is that there are some moral judgements
with which he would wish to associate himself  to hold a moral opinion
is he suggests not to know something to be true but to have
preferences regarding human activity

	again not true the characters in a tt or type one font depend on the 
	maker if someone converts a type one font to tt they will only get the
	characters in the font of orgin tt allows for much more flexibility
	in this area as well you can have thousands of glyphs in a tt font
	file macpswindowsunicode char set and use the characters
	appropriate for the particular platform you are running the font on

well yes both type one and truetype fonts can contain lots of characters
and in both cases plain text fonts will be reencoded to windows ansi
in windows and to mac standard roman encoding on the mac 
no difference there between tone and tt   

and as for fonts with thousands of glyphs right know these are a liabiliaty
rather than a great new thing  reason is that a font with three thousand characters
is very large and if you can only access two hundred and twentyfour of them you are paying a heavy
price in downloading time and printer storage  and at the moment there
is only one program of that uses partial font downloading

	for instance all or our fontpack two tt fonts have the macwindows
	char set in them the metrics of the fonts are such that if the font
	is brought over to the mac the user will have access to the full mac
	char set 	

yes and tone text fonts all have the iso adobe character set which is
a superset of windows ansi and macintosh standard roman enocding

the question is whether you can get at the glyphs  in windows for example
you cannot get at the ligatures fi anfd fl both tone and tteven though a
font may very well have them

and while it is somewhat painful to reencode a type one font and to create a
new windows metric file pfm for it there are utilities out there to allow
you do this  how do i reencode a truetype font  how can i get at the
fi and fl ligatures in windows or on the mac  are there utilities
that make it possible to circumvent the hardwired windows ansi encoding

 actually the real reason that stern was getting a bigger rating share was that
 he was new in dc not because of the quality if you can call it that of 
 his show after the fine was issued he started to get better ratings because 
 of the curious individuals who wanted to see how bad he actually was since
 he came to dc he has had a greater turn over of listeners than the grease
 has in other words more people get sick of him sooner than they do of the
 grease after all saying vagina or penis on the air is hilarious at first 
 the second time it is still a little funny but when you do it all the time 
 and at the same time think you are the greatest man on the planet and tell
 everyone so than you are going to get old really quick 
 give it up mark you are wrong
 
excuse me but if you really new what the show was about you would know that he
does not just say vagina and penis and that is how he gets his ratings he
also addresss real issues as well as being outrageous i do not hear any of these
other idiots doing a funny show and getting into some serious topics at the
same time he gets people to think and entertains them at the same time 
so try listening to his show a little closer before you tell them that they are
wrong and by the way if he is such a flash in the pan why do his ratings sustain
so well hmm

this morning at four am while i was working on my research paper i had to

what is otis

otis is here for the purpose of distributing original artwork
and photographs over the network for public perusal scrutiny    
and distribution  digital immortality

the basic idea behind digital immortality is that computer networks   
are here to stay and that anything interesting you deposit on them
will be around nearforever  the gifs and jpgs of today will be the
artifacts of a digital future  perhaps they will be put in different
formats perhaps only surviving on backup tapesbut they will be
thereand someone will dig them up  
 
if that does not interest you otis also offers a forum for critique
and exhibition of your worksa virtual art gallery that never closes
and exists in an information dimension where your submissions will hang
as wallpaper on thousands of glowing monitors  suddenly life is 
breathed into your workand by merit of it is stimulus it will 
travel the globe on pulses of light and electrons
 
spectators are welcome also feel free to browse the gallery and 
let the artists know what you think of their efforts  keep your own
copies of the images to look at when you have got the gumption
that is what they are here for



where             

otis currently as of fourtwentyoneninetythree has two ftp sites  
 
 	one hundred and fortyonetwo hundred and fourteenfourone hundred and thirtyfive projectsotis the uwi site
		
	sunsiteuncedu pubmultimediapicturesotis the sunsite 
	you can also gopher to this site for otis as well

merely anonymous ftp to either site on internet and change to the
appropriate directory  do not forget to get busy and use the bin
command to make sure you are in binary

otis has also been spreading to some dialup bbs systems around north
americathe following systems have a substancial supply of

how do you contribute
              
what happens isyou draw a pretty picture or take a lovely   
photo get it scanned into an image file then either ftpput
it in the contribincoming directory or use uuencode to send it to me
email addresses at eof in email  after the image is received
it will be put into the correct directory  computer originated works
are also welcome

otis directories house two types of image files gif and jpg  
gif and jpg files require oddly enough a gif or jpg viewer to 
see  these viewers are available for all types of computers at 
most large ftp sites around internet  jpg viewers are a bit
tougher to find  if you cannot find one but do have a gif viewer  
you can obtain a jpgtogif conversion program which will change    
jpg files to a standard gif format 

otis also accepts animation files      

when you submit image files please send me email at the same time
stating information about what you uploaded and whether it is to be
used in publications or other projects or if it is merely for people
to view  also include some biographical information on yourself we will
be having infofiles on each contributing artist and their works  you 
can also just upload a textfile of info about yourself instead of 
emailing

if you have pictures but no scanner there is hope  merely send
copies to

the otis project
co ed stastny
po bx two hundred and fortyone thousand one hundred and thirteen
omaha ne sixtyeight thousand one hundred and twentyfourone thousand one hundred and thirteen

i will either scan them myself or get them to someone who will  
scan them  include an ample sase if you want your stuff back  
also include information on each image preferably a onethree line 
description of the image that we can include in the infofile in the
directory where it is finally put  if you have preferences as to what
the images are to be named include those as well  
 
conversely if you have a scanner and would like to help out please
contact me and we will arrange things

if you want to submit your works by disk peachy  merely send a threefive
disk to the above address omaha and a sase if you want your disk back
this is good for people who do not have direct access to encoders or ftp
but do have access to a scanner  we accept disks in either mac or ibm
compatible format  if possible please submit image files as gif or
jpg  if you cannotwe can convert from most formatswe would just rather
not have to

at senders request we can also fill disks with as much otis as they
can stand  even if you do not have stuff to contribute you can send
a blank disk and an sase or twofifty for disk postage and packing to 
get a slabootis

as of fourtwentyoneninetythree we are at about eighteen megabytes of files and growing  
email me for current archive size and directory



distribution

the images distributed by the otis project may be distributed freely   
on the condition that the original filename is kept and that it is
not altered in any way save to convert from one image format to
another  in fact we encourage files to be distributed to local 
bulletin boards and such  if you could please transport the
appropriate text files along with the images  
 
it would also be nice if you would send me a note when you did post images
from otis to your local bbs  i just want to keep track of them so
participants can have some idea how widespread their stuff is

it is the purpose of otis to get these images spread out as much as
possible  if you have the time please upload a few to your favorite
bbs systemor even just post this infofile there  it would be
keen of you



use

if you want to use any of the works you find on the otis directory
you will have to check to see if permission has been granted and the 
stipulations of the permission such as free copy of publication or
full address credit  you will either find this in the rm file for    
the image or series of imagesor in the artists directory under the 
artists name  if permission is not explicitly given then you will have 
to contact the artist to ask for it  if no info is available email
me edcwisunomahaedu and i will get in contact with the artist for 
you or give you their contact information
 
when you do use permitted work it is always courteous to let the artist
know about it perhaps even send them a free copy or some such
compensation for their files



naming images

please keep the names of your files in dos format  that means keep
the filename before jpg or gif to eight characters or less  the way
i usually do it is to use the initials of the artist plus a three or
four digit code for the series of images plus the series number
thus leonardo devincis fifth mechanical drawing would be something
like
 
	ldmekfivegif     or    ldmekfivejpg    or    ldmechfivegif   etc

keeping the names under eight characters assures that the filename will
remain intact on all systems  


 

creating image files

when creating image files be sure to at least include your name
somewhere on or below the picture  this gives people a reference in
case they would like to contact you  you may also want to include a title
address or other information you would like people to know



hmmm

     what a delightful opportunity to cause some trouble  for
providing me this forum i would sincerely like to thank the yous
space foundation  my topic today is the single stage rocket
technology rocket or ssrt  by i intend to speak of more  how to
lower the cost and make rapid progress  ssrt is to my mind 
and i hope to convince you  the erupting a new rallying cry for
our generation in space  faster cheaper and better

     faster cheaper better and ssrt represent the passing of a
torch from one technical generation to another  it is a new
thing to be sure  but it is also a relearning of old things
from past masters

     when we rolled out the ssrt baby two weeks ago so called
experts told us it violates the laws of physics  it made no
sense  for example dr eberhart rachtin  former president of
the aerospace corp said of ssrt in the la times that it
defies the best principles of launching payloads into space 
well dr rachtin  you have made us mad  what are these
principles that ssrt defies

     well i will tell you  it violates the principle that you need
a giant program office to build space hardware  it violates the
fact that it takes twenty years to build something new  and it
violates the truism that you cannot do anything significant for
less than many billions of dollars

     it took some of the last generations experts to teach us
some newold lessons  werhner von brauns first rocket was not a
saturn v  general schrievers icbms did not take ten years to
demonstrate  and the xone airplane did not cost one billion

     it took one of the great engineers of the one thousand nine hundred and fiftys to remind
us of these truths  max hunter  max to remind you was a
senior engineer in the thor irbm program and old faster better
cheaper success story  max has been persistent in a vision of a
single stage reusable space launch system since the one thousand nine hundred and sixtys 
because he knew it had to be done in affordable steps  build a
little test a little

     next he persuaded us to do a technology demonstration  we
did not solicit a bunch of requirements  they would just change
every few years anyway   not included in the speech  the
alsnls has such ephemeral requirements that it would better
known as shape shifter than space lifter  we did not spend a
lot money  this xrocket only cost sixty million  when is the
last time we even built a new airplane for that  and it did not
take a lot of time to build  mcdonnell douglas completed it in
eighteen months  finally the government program office consisted of
one very overworked air force major  motivated in part by the
threat that he would get to ride on it in a strappedon lawn chair if
it ran over cost or schedule

     as i described what ssrt is  and is not keep in mind its
only a first step  there are several more steps  and steps
that can easily fail  before the yous can field an ssto  but
each step should follow the same principles  a small management
team  a few years technology demonstration  and a modest
budget

     let me show a few details on ssrt and how it might evolve
see charts

     i am embarrassed when my generation is compared with the last
generation  the giants of the last great space era the one thousand nine hundred and fiftys
and one thousand nine hundred and sixtys  they went to the moon  we built a telescope that
cannot see straight  they softlanded on mars  the least we
could do is softland on earth

     but we do have an answer  we can follow their build a
little test a little philosophy to produce a truly affordable
and routine access to space  i know there are nay sayers among
you  those who say ssrt is a stunt  it needs more thermal
protection the engines are wrong it would be better to land
horizontally etc etc

     i say to you  we will see you at white sands in june  you
bring your viewgraphs and i will bring my rocketship  if we do
what we say we can do then you let us do the next step   not
included in the speech  if we fail  you still have your
program offices staff summary sheets requirement analyses and
decade long programs

     i bet on my generation and max hunters idea  any takers

look how long the maple leafs and nordiques used similar logic  not that
they fielded bad teams solely to field bad teams but the maple leafs and a
certain dead man who was in charge were one of the cheapest teams in the
history of the sport  guess what they were immensely popular at the
gate  the nordiques have also done well for a team that had missed the
playoffs so many years in a row

 look at british or any european soccer as an example they never have fan
 problems

ha  such humor  they have major fan problems namely that on occasion some of
them do not make it home from the match  the soccer fans tend to be fanatical
much like the montreal fans who firebomb the players and coaches houses when

benedikt rosenau writes with great authority

     if it is contradictory it cannot exist

contradictory is a property of language  if i correct this to

      things defined by contradictory language do not exist

i will object to definitions as reality  if you then amend it to

      things described by contradictory language do not exist

then we have come to something which is plainly false  failures in
description are merely failures in description

 how about this description an object that is at one time both a
euclidean square and a euclidean circle i hold that no object satisfying
this description could exist the description is inconsistent and hence
describes an object that could not exist
 now suppose someone pointed to a bicycle and said that object is
at one time both a euclidean square and a euclidean circle this does
not mean that the bicycle does not exist it measn that the description
was incorrectly applied
 
 the atheist says the descriptions of god that i have been presented with
are contradictory and hence describe something that cannot exist
 now your position so far as i can gather is that god exists but the
descriptions atheists have been presented with are simply bad descriptions
of it
 this is roughly analogous to someone who has never seen a bicycle and
when they ask for a description from people who claim to have seen one
are told that it is a euclidean circlesquare can they be blamed for
doubting rather strongly that this bicycle exists at all

i am under the impression that message enhances flavor by causing the
taste buds to swell

no that is not how it works

if this is correct i do not find it unreasonable
to assume that high doses of message can cause other mouth tissues to swell

this may be through a different mechanism

also as the many of the occurances including two of the above
involved beef and as beef is frequently tenderized with message this is
what i suspect as being the because

tenderizing beef involves sprinking or marinading it in papain an enzyme
meat tenderizer packets might contain papain and message and seasonings but
message does not act as a tenderizer

 why not the chip design  well here is the possiblity  in addition to
 encryption the chip preprocesses voice signals to make them easier

 effectively be part of a massively parallel computer for voice

first of all the chip does not do that  it runs at sixteen megabitssecond
which is far beyond what you need for voice  it is obviously intended
for data as well and on highspeed lines at that

second  what advantage is there to doing the processing in the phone
i do not care how fancy that chip is it is not as fancy as the roomful
of analyzers at fort meade running the program they will have five years from
now  they cannot update every clipper chip that is out there

third  if they did do this preprocessing in the chip it would probably
have a serious effect on recognizability of the voice patterns  if
nothing else that would hurt the acceptability of the product  the
vthirtytwobis modems are just barely fast enough to do a good job on properly
massaged voice as is add any more to the mix and you are completely out

 hi  i was doing research on subliminal suggestion for a psychology
 paper and i read that one researcher flashed hidden messages on the
 tv screen at onetwo hundredths of a second  is that possible  i thought the
 maximum rate the tv was even capable of displaying images was onethirtyth
 of a second  or onesixtyth of a second for an image composed of only odd
 or even scan lines

you are correct the fastest complete image that could be presented on
tv would be one field which is onesixty of a second approximately  of course
the phrase tv screen is often thrown around in reference to any crt
display so perhaps this researcher was not using normal tv rates  might
even be a vector strokewriter display in which case the lower limit
on image time is anyones guess and is probably phosphorpersistence limited

actually a lot of this work used to be done with a crt that had a beamsplitter
mounted in front and a tachistoscope driving it  the tachistoscope is really
just a slide projector with a very fast shutter  low tech but it does the job

frankly no  offense and defense are equally important  but the

is on offense  even shortstops are a bigger part of the offensive

is there such a thing as message monosodium glutamate sensitivity
i saw in the ny times sunday that scientists have testified before 
an fda advisory panel that complaints about message sensitivity are
superstition anybody here have experience to the contrary 

i am old enough to remember that the issue has come up at least
a couple of times since the one thousand nine hundred and sixtys then it was called the
chinese restaurant syndrome because chinese cuisine has
always used it

so far i have seen about a dozen posts of anecdotal evidence but
no facts  i suspect there is a strong psychological effect at 
work here  does anyone have results from a scientific study
using doubleblind trials  

check out twentyseven thousand nine hundred and three just some twenty posts before your own maybe you missed
it amidst the flurry of responses yet again the use of this
newsgroup is hampered by people not restricting their posts to matters
they have substantial knowledge of

for cites on message look up almost anything by john w olney a
toxicologist who has studied the effects of message on the brain and on
development  it is undisputed in the literature that message is an
excitotoxic food additive and that its major constituent glutamate
is essentially the premierie neurotransmitter in the mammalian brain
humans included  too much in the diet and the system gets thrown
off  glutamate and aspartate also an excitotoxin are necessary in
small amounts and are freely available in many foods but the amounts
added by industry are far above the amounts that would normally be
encountered in a ny single food  by eating lots of junk food
packaged soups and diet soft drinks it is possible to jack your
blood levels so high that anyone with a sensitivity to these
compounds will suffer numerous real physininelogical effects 
read olneys review paper in prog brain res one thousand nine hundred and eightyeight and check his
sources they are impecable there is no dispute

                    dianne murray    wcsbeauccscarletonca

in order to excitotoxin effects of message message that in blood must go through 
bloodbrain barrier that i am not sure message can go through or not in normal condition the concentration of glutamate in the cerebrospinal fluid is about 
two um that is high enough to activate one type of glutamate receptorthe nmda
receptor but the question is neuron and glial cell in the brain have a lots of transport to get glutamate into neuron or glial so no one know exact concentration of glutamate is around neurons 

glutamate is most important neurotransmitter in the central nervous system it is involved in not only in daily life like the controling of movement it is alsoinvolved in develpoment memory and learn it is involved in lognterm potentialtion that be thought is the basis of learning

happens all of the time and he recomended putting a bug deflector on the
hood he said that the trucks for some unknown reason seem to have this
problem more than some cars 

it seems to me that either my luck is really bad or there might be a problem
with the paint painted on a monday morning perhaps 
 
how well do these bug deflectors work for small road debris on trucks 
 
if anyone has any experiencessuggestions please let me know thanks

why must you pursue this fantasy that all crime is derived from underground

i explained how the wod is a major because of largescale crime in america  the

as for me well i think i will go take a walk tonightalone  i feel safe  i
just hope the fdafbideabatf is not back at my apartment confiscating all my
property because they found my phone number written on a phone booth that was
also used by a drug dealer 

yeah buddy this happens all the time  tell me has it every really happened

 in that sense i do not feel safe  i am an honest

must i ask again what part

even if the wod actually reduced crime we just created a new class of
criminals headed up the gangs current leader bill clinton  the dea etc
are private armies that answer directly to the president  they possess
advanced weapons and survailance technology  does this sound familiar to
anybody

do you support mein furher clinton  hmmmmmm  you seem to have come out

hard by the washington monument within clear view of the jefferson

has arisen on some of the most hallowed territory of the united states of
america a costly and dangerous mistake  on ground where no monument yet
marks countless sacrifices and unheralded achievements of americans of all

massive and costly edifice devoted above all to a contentious and false
version of the ordeal in europe during world war ii of nonamerican
members of a minority sectarian group  now in the deceptive guise of
tolerance the united states holocaust memorial museum begins a propaganda
campaign financed through the unwitting largess of the american taxpayer

after reading the first paragraph a quick scan confirmed my first
impression this is a bunch of revisionist and antisemitic hogwash

dtatepittedu david m tate writes

 of course they left rbis off we are comparing alomar the individual with
 baerga the individual so only individual stats count  

i forgot  most runs are scored by players stealing home so rbi do not
count for anything

uh right  you also forgot that you cannot get an rbi barring a hr with
nobody on base  what fraction of all runs come on solo hr

most runs are scored because there happened to be players on base when the
batter did something good  i use the phrase happened to be advisedly
lots of people have tried to figure out who the players are who have the
most ability to turn it up a notch in clutchrbiwhatever situations and
what they have found is that there is no evidence that anyone has such an
ability to any measurable extent  there are no clutch hitters  people who
tend to do things that would because an rbi if there were somebody on base
end up getting rbis proportional to how many of their teammates obliged by
being in position  

my mistake

i agree

me too rbi are a worthless stat of course so is stolen bases because 
sometimes runners are in front of a player that would otherwise run and of
course pitchers pitch differently with different people on different bases
so batting average slugging and obp out too  hmmm i guess homers would
not count then either
my point rbi might not be a perfect stat but nothing is and no stat or lack

       no what you said was that we had spent money on guns rather than
people as canada does  which is ridiculous


once again i have over estimated the general level of intellegence of
the average reader of rushlimbaugh  canada per capita spend more
money on people where the us spend more money per capita on guns

what exactly do you mean when you say the yous spends more per capita on
guns than canada does  are you talking about the yous government or are you
talking about the purchase of guns by private citizens or both  if you are
referring to private citizens then your point is irrevelant because what
individuals do with their money is essentially their business

if on the other hand you meant that the yous government spends more per
capita on guns than canada does then your point is relevant  so if this
is true then the yous needs to get its priorities straight  people are more
important than guns  that is not to say that guns are not important  i am
just saying that if the yous government does spend more per capita on guns
than they do on people then something is awry


    he meant the us spends more per capita on guns than canada which is not
really surprising because we were so busy protecting the western world from
the ussr that all other countries could slack off on their defense spending

    i would like to see if the us spends more per capita on people than 
canada does  this is a true apples  apples comparison where the previous

         you might have missed the yous news  world report excerpt
  i posted  it is fairly consistant with other such polls finding
  that approximately fortyfifty of households have at least one firearm

 	ok  a nearmajority actually own firearms but i will still
 	claim that the vast majority never needs to use them or even
 	threaten anyone with them

five hundredzero to onezerozero selfdefense incidents a year does not count with you

       what do they do right  or are
 	they just lucky  

maybe they are just unlucky  if a rapist pulls a woman into an alley
in boston chances are almost certain that she will not be counted 
as one of those selfdefenders because our local constabulary did not
consider it important that she be allowed to arm herself  even though
the shotgun she owns at home makes her show up in the gun owner column

       in either case this means the average
 	threat level in this country is rather low 

ironic words for somebody who lives in florida  the average threat
level in florida has been reduced by a liberal ccw policy  it is well
known that your local thugs like to target tourists precisely because 
they are less likely to be carrying than your natives  come on up to
boston or nyc or washington dc and see how much diddlysquat the 
average threat level in the country means to a resident there

 	i think you have weapons on the brain i never said that these
 	alternative means of selfprotection involved any hardware
 	why are good neighborhoods good  it is not because every
 	person is armed to the teeth it is because of one attitude
 	and two cooperation in the good neighborhoods the residents
 	make themselves aware of their neighbors and notice when
 	strangers are lurking around good neighborhoods form groups
 	like crimewatch to increase this effect and the relative
 	effectiveness of the police when hostiles are arrested the
 	good neighbors step up and say that is the one officer  he
 	was robbing mr jones house 

sometimes this works  sometimes it just lands your good neighbors 
on the dance card for the next wave of drivebys  someone here once
told a story about la gangs moving into phoenix  i have misplaced the
original text but the story started with one resident calling the 
cops on a gang member  sure enough a few nights later there was a 
driveby performed at the residents house  except that this time
unlike in la the entire street came out and returned fire putting
an end to the cars occupants  the gang packed up and left

of course in la or in a place like florida after the hurricane
your first problem is to find an officer to step up to and tell
anything

 	in short the alternative to firepower is gangs  or at
 	least a benificent manifestation of that social cooperative
 	replace lead with flesh  the flesh makes a better
 	conversationalist too and you can invite it over for a
 	block party 

look nobody is arguing this  i have a fire extinguisher at home  
that does not mean i can be careless about tossing my burnt matches 
on the carpet  i live carefully monitor the woodstove get my flue
cleaned twice a year and test my smoke alarms annually  but if 
despite all this  a fire does start it is too late for any of
these things except the extinguisher

         but legality and legitimacy also matter  if a governments charter
  makes a rule which the government then violates it is violated the
  basis for its existance  enforcement of its will becomes a matter
  solely of force of arms
 
 	oliver north the man is positively worshiped in many
 	allamerican conservative quarters he and big ron
 	setup a secret government and did all sorts of severely
 	illegal deeds  the kind of stuff you and i would be doing
 	twentytolife for yet he walks free this bs happens all
 	the time in fact it happens so much that no one really
 	cares anymore  legitimacy is a nonissue legality is
 	a nonissue so long as we get tbones and our mtv who
 	gives a rats ass  

you seem to be agreeing with your opponent  you cannot trust your
government to protect you from abusers and violators  whitecollar
bluecollar epauletted or tankshirted  ultimately no one has the
power to enforce your rights but you  unless you have given up that 
power

 	no i claimed that no one is interested in the statistical
 	aspects of the argument pure emotion like the abortion issue

too many people fit that category that is true  some of us like to
believe that they are uninterested in the facts behind the case for gun 
ownership because they have been conditioned to believe that there are not 
any  you seem content to underestimate the electorate i am willing to
try to raise their consciousness

 	argue away  you cannot win 

i think we can

hci was founded in what one thousand nine hundred and eighty  in the mideightys they ran a one 
million strong campaign for two years before reaching this goal  
my understanding is that they reached it by the stratagem of including
wide classes of people other than duespaying members  i cannot speak
authoritatively on this  maybe somebody else has details  then they
started running a two million strong campaign for a while  but they
let it slip into unannounced obscurity when it became clear that they
simply were never going to reach that level of membership

in one thousand nine hundred and sixtyfour just after the commencement of the dodd hearings  the starting
point of the modern guncontrol movement the nra had a mere six hundred and twentyfivezero members  
by one thousand nine hundred and sixtyeight barely after the first murmurs of future registration it had 
about a million  today it has over three million members making it the
third largest membership organization in the country next to aarp and aaa
and its membership is growing faster than at any previous time  historical
figures from kuklas gun control pp sixtyone and four hundred and twenty

as you say many of the people in the middle of this debate are bemused
by their tbones and mtv  that leaves hardcore gunowners against 
hardcore gun banners

i know a number of exhci members who have recently become nra members
i have never heard of a single one who has gone the other way

yes i think we can and will win this one

 	firearmsrelated mindless mayhem will be related to the
 	availibility of firearms if they become scarce and 
 	and expensive a different psychology will take hold
 	i think they would be used far less to settle trivial
 	complaints 

i think they would be used far less to hammer nails as well but
like you i cannot give any citation showing that this utilization is
currently significant at more than an anecdotal level  if you can

i say in theory because in another case a woman was held in
contempt for refusing to reveal the location of her child even after
taking the fiveth in this case the woman was suspected of having
murdered the kid so taking the fiveth was not surprising sure so she
was probably guilty but that is not good enough in our system you are
not supposed to be able to force a suspect to confess to a crime no
matter how strongly you think they are guilty  you have to develop
your evidence independently doing otherwise might catch a few more
crooks but only at the cost of turning the clock back to the middle
ages when confessions were routinely tortured out of suspects both
guilty and innocent

 ok i should have read the thread before posting my own zerotwo  i would
just add to phils very infomative discussion the following caveat the
fifth amendment applies only in crinial cases  nor shall any person 
  be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself
thus if the father sued for custody of the children the case would be
civil and the defendant mother would not have fifth amendment protection
oddly enough her refusal to give information in a civil case can lead to
criminal contempt charges thus landing her in jail  the interesting part
of all this is that in a murder trial the woman can plead the fifth as 
to the location of the childthis is routine  a computer crime 
prosecution thus would seem to be fertile ground for this kind of defense 
where a suit by a party injured by hackers would not  if i am accused 
for example of sending encrypted kiddie porn over the nets the fifth should 
protect my key  if i am accused of sending copyrighted material however
it proabably will not copyright infringement not being a crime in the
technical sense  the really tricky question is say i do both naughty
boy that i am can the government use the information gained in the civil
trial ie my key to gain access to my files for use in the criminal
prosecution  the answer should certainly be no but lord only knows how
this would work out

not that logic has anything to do with it but
i can see the liability of putting stickers on the car while it was moving

in a known unsafe condition that would seem to be liable furthermore they
would have had the last chance to avoid an unsafe situation which is an

subject vanishing font problem
organization department of mathematics queens university at kingston
lines twentyfive

   a colleague has a bizarre font problem on his new mips workstation
when he first logs on via xdm he has a single xterm window appear
with the mwm window manager running  in this configuration x windows
applications particularly xdvi work fine  however if he opens up a
second xterm application suddenly xdvi cannot start in either window
giving the error unable to load iso eight thousand eight hundred and fiftynineone font

   the only difference between the two xterm windows is that the initial
one references a different name in the xsession file with prettier
colours and other slight changes  further investigation shows that only
opening a default xterm causes this behaviour and more significant all
x applications can no longer load any fonts if they are invoked from the
command line in either window  if i start the xterm with a different
font using the fn option no problems  it would seem that the
default xterm is loading a font which somehow causes the server to lose
all of its fonts  note xlsfonts in either window shows all of the
fonts available so there does not appear to be a problem in the font
directorieshashtables

   other than rewriting the xterm appdefaults file to use a different
font and hope for the best does anyone have any ideas

more info  this is the most recent mips workstation rfour thousand i believe
       with the most current operating system and running xelevenrfive

 fiftyone arrested for defying judges order at abortion protest rally
 the miami herald april eleven one thousand nine hundred and ninetythree
 
    circuit judge robert mcgregors order prohibits antiabortion pickets
    within thirtysix feet of the property line of aware woman center for choice
    even across the street they may not display pictures of dead fetuses
    or sing or chant loud enough to be heard by patients inside the clinic

 several years ago justice william o douglas who was
 about as libertarian as you can get about freespeech 
 and similar issues wrote a majority opinion in which
 the supreme court turned down an appeal by a group of
 people who had been prohibited from demonstrating in
 front of their landlords home  

do you have a cite for the case  you do not give enough
information to be able to compare the two situations
if the demonstrators had been blaring loud rock music 
into the landlords home all day and night then i could
see how the opinion would be justified  but this court
order had prohibited abortion protesters from displaying
pictures of dead fetuses which does not disrupt the privacy
of anyone inside the clinic  

 he pointed out that
 people have a right to be free from speech 

perhaps in the privacy of their homes but not on public
property  did the korean grocery store owner in new york
city have a right to be free from the speech of the protesters 
outside his store  patrons inside the store could hear the 
protesters asking them to reconsider shopping there  how 
is that different from the abortion protesters asking women 
to reconsider getting an abortion at a clinic  

 harassment goes beyond
 expression to direct attack on particular persons
 in this case the workers and clients at a clinic
 its purpose is clearly not to convey information or
 express an opinion but to intimidate and do harm to
 other others

even if the protesters speech could be considered
harassment which it is not hate speech laws have 
generally been struck down by the courts  i do not see 
how the words do not kill your baby or abortion is 
murder could be considered harassment

 antiabortionists have lost the battle for public
 opinion and the more psychopathic among them have
 turned to harassment arson bombing and murder to
 carry on their war  there is no reason not to 
 restrain them to protect the ordinary civil rights
 of everyone else

some of the protesters were arrested for simply praying
quietly on a public sidewalk  yeah i could see how
that might be equivalent to bombing and murder
uh huh  let us know when you get a grip on reality

the only explanation i can think of is that two capacitors in series
can handle twice the output voltage sometimes two elcos in antiseries
you know positive sides facing eachother are used to obtain a large
capacitor that can handle positive and negative voltages as well

so there probably is no designphilosophical reason but a productioncost

whether the drive is hooked up to the computer or not the lpstwo hundred and forty
makes a disk seek noise every twenty seconds  this is consistent 
and will continue as lomg as the drive is powered up  even if 
i disconnect the drive from the computer this drive activity
continues at twenty second intervals

someone tried to tell me the drive was doing a thermal recalibration

not knowing beans about the internal physical workings of the lastest
disk drive technology i guess i might believe anything

what is the scoop on this standalone drive activity every twenty sec

i can only comment on thermal recalibration in general some new
drives perform it in order to increase overall integrity of data
writes basically the firmware instructs the actuator to perform
a test to see if the data tracks are within a certain physical
tolerance since when the media heats up or cools down some
track drift is inevitable and the drive has to monitor it this
becomes especially critical at very high recording densities and
so was used primarily on very largecapacity mechanisms but it
seems to be finding its way into more smaller drives as a way of
boosting the drives longterm reliability and mtbf ratings

i first became aware of thermal recalibration when it was pointed
out that the technique conflicts with prolonged write times when
digitizing say audio or video to hard disk some manufacturers
explicitly state that drives with thermal recalibration are not
to be used for applications that have prolonged disk writes

hope this helps

the biggest hurdle for automatics imho is not shifting speed
per se but rather the transmissions reaction speed when you
try to force it to shift manually  

this was the biggest fault with the subaru ecvt  it took soooooo
lonnnnnnnnggggg for the tranny to find the right ratio

the sales propaganda says the saturn automatic is effectively an
electronicallyshifted manual  might this mean that saturn has
conquered the problem  i do not know only driven saturn fivespeeds

does anybody out there have one of those food dehydrators i have been seeing
all over latenight tv recently i was wondering if they use forced air hea
or both if there is heat involved anybody know what temperature they run at
my wife would like one and i am not inclined to pay one hundredzero for a box a fan
and a heater seems to me you should be able to throw a dehydrator together
for just a few bucks heck the technology is only what onezero years old

you can learn how to build a deyhdrator very easily from the book the
hungry hikers guide to good food by gretchen mchugh  the heat source
is a one hundred watt light bulb  basically it is a vertical wooden box with
ventilation holes in the top and bottom lots of them you want the air
to flow  the light bulb goes in the bottom and wire cake racks are
spaced every six starting about ten above the bulb

or at a slightly higher cost in electricity you can do what i do  use
your oven  note  i do this in an electric oven some gas ovens may
not have a low enough setting  put food to be dried on cookie tins or
racks in the oven  set oven to one hundred and forty degrees the lowest setting on my
oven  if yours goes down to one hundred and twenty that is probably even better  stick a
wooden spoon or something across the front corner of the oven and close
the door on the spoon so that it stays open about an inch  this allows
for airflow  leave the stuff in the oven for six to eight hours check it
often since this dries it much faster than the dehydrator  if you are
using cookie sheets instead of racks turn the stuff over halfway
through

if you want more info email me since this is not really the right sub
for this stuff

hollombepolymathtticom the polymath writes

the possession of nuclear arms actually weapons grade fissionables is
currently regulated only by market forces  ie  to own them you have to
either make them buy them or steal them  the only thing that stops you
is the staggering cost more than most nations can afford the fact that
no one who has them wants to sell to you and the tight security maintained
on existing stocks just ask saddam hussein

i was under the impression that to obtain fissionable materials ie
plutonium or reactorweaponsgrade uranium one was required to obtain
a federal permit to own such materials

given a source of fissionables you can build a bomb in your garage with
parts from hardware stores and electronic junk supplies  you might have
to engage in some shady dealings to get the explosive charge but that is
trivial compared to getting the plutonium  the basic information on the
design was declassified years ago and can be dug out of any technical
library by a physics grad student

actually why bother looking it up  from the material we covered last
term in ten weeks of gech one hundred and twentyseven nuclear chemistry i could derive
what it would take to build a bomb  and as far as the explosive charge
i as a chemist could synthesize a variety of explosives from commonly
available chemicals in the garage if i felt like  the electronics 
behind the detonator and the shaped charges are a little trickier
however    but not impossible using a few tricks of the trade
and if i really wanted to be nasty i could include a core of 
hydrogen and deuterium   

of course the hardest part is getting the fissionable material
to start with and living long enough to put a bomb together 
plutonium has some nasty properties

editorial note the increase in reported gonorrhea cases in colorado in one thousand nine hundred and ninetytwo 
may represent an overall increase in the occurrence of this disease or more 
complete reporting stimulated by visitations to laboratories by cdh 
surveillance staff during one thousand nine hundred and ninetyoneone thousand nine hundred and ninetytwo the increases in confirmed gonorrhea 
cases at dmhc and in culturepositivity rates in three of four laboratories 
suggest a real increase in gonorrhea rather than a reporting artifact 
however the stable culturepositivity rate in the nonprofit family planning 
laboratory which serves a network of clinics statewide indicates that the 
gonorrhea increase did not uniformly affect all segments of the population 
     one possible explanation for the increased occurrence of gonorrhea in 
colorado may be gang and drugrelated sexual behavior as implicated in a 
recent outbreak of drugresistant gonorrhea and other stds in colorado springs 
two although the high morbidity census tracts in the denver metropolitan area 
coincide with areas of gang and drug activity this hypothesis requires 
further assessment to examine the possible role of drug use  implicated 
previously as a factor contributing to the national increase in syphilis threesix 
 the cdh stdaids program is collecting information from all persons in whom 
gonorrhea is diagnosed regarding drug use exchange of sex for money or drugs 
and gang affiliation 
     the gonorrhea rate for blacks in colorado substantially exceeds the 
national health objective for the year two thousand one thousand three hundred per one hundredzero objective 
nineteenonea seven race is likely a risk marker rather than a risk factor for 
gonorrhea and other stds risk markers may be useful for identifying groups at 
greatest risk for stds and for targeting prevention efforts moreover race
specific variation in std rates may reflect differences in factors such as 
socioeconomic status access to medical care and highrisk behaviors 
     in response to the increased occurrence of gonorrhea in colorado 
interventions initiated by the cdh stdaids program include one targeting 
partner notification in the denver metropolitan area to persons in groups at 
increased risk eg fifteennineteenyearold black females and twentytwentyfouryearold black 
males two implementing a media campaign eg public service radio

states passed legislation requiring the use of child safety seats or safety 
belts for children although these laws reduce injuries to young children by

occupant restraints among children decreases inversely with age eightyfour usage for

for the youngest child aged less than eleven years within a household cdc 
analyzed data obtained from the behavioral risk factor surveillance system 
brfss during one thousand nine hundred and eightyeight and one thousand nine hundred and eightynine this report summarizes the findings from this

     data were available for twentynine hundred and five respondents aged greater than or equal to

randomdigitdialed telephone survey  and administered a standard injury 
control and child safety module developed by cdc of these respondents five thousand four hundred and ninetynine 
twentysix had a child aged less than eleven years in their household each respondent 
was asked to specify the childs age and the frequency of restraint use for 
that child the two categories of child restraint and adult safetybelt use in 
this analysis were one consistent use ie always buckle up and two less than 
consistent use ie almost always sometimes rarely or never buckle up 
data were weighted to provide estimates representative of each state software

     each of the eleven states had some type of child restraint law of these six 
arizona kentucky maine nebraska rhode island and west virginia had no 
law requiring adults to use safety belts four idaho maryland pennsylvania 
and washington had a secondary enforcement mandatory safetybelt law ie a 
vehicle had to be stopped for a traffic violation before a citation for nonuse 
of safety belts could be issued and one state new york had a primary

laws included all children aged less than five years but the other two states 
used both age and size of the child as criteria for mandatory restraint use 
the analysis in this report subgrouped states into one those having a law 
requiring adult safetybelt use law states and two those without such a law 
nolaw states 
     overall twentyone of children aged less than eleven years reportedly were not 
consistently restrained during automobile travel both child restraint use and 
adult restraint use were significantly higher p less than zerofive chisquare 
test in law states than in nolaw states eightyoneone versus seventyfourthree and fiftyeightseven versus 
fortythreetwo respectively 
     high rates of restraint use for children aged less than or equal to one 
year were reported by both adults indicating consistent and less than 
consistent safetybelt use figure one adults with consistent use reported 
high rates of childoccupant restraint use regardless of the childs age 
range ninetyfivefive for oneyearolds to eightyfourseven for tenyearolds in comparison for 
adults reporting less than consistent safetybelt use the rate of child
occupant restraint use declined sharply by the age of the child range ninetythreeone 
for oneyearolds to twentyeighteight for tenyearolds when comparing children of 
consistent adult safetybelt users with children of less than consistent adult 
safetybelt users ninetyfive confidence intervals overlap for the two youngest age 
groups ie aged less than one and one year 
     reported childoccupant restraint use in law states generally exceeded 
that in nolaw states regardless of age of child table one in addition 
higher adult educational attainment was significantly associated with 
increased restraint use for children a factor that has also been associated 
with increased adult safetybelt use eight 

reported by national center for injury prevention and control national 
center for chronic disease prevention and health promotion cdc 

editorial note the findings in this report are consistent with others 
indicating that adults who do not use safety belts themselves are less likely 
to employ occupant restraints for their children sixnine because these 
nonbelted adults are at increased risk of crashing and more likely to exhibit 
other risktaking behaviors children traveling with them may be at greater 
risk for motorvehicle injury ten 
     educational attainment of adult respondents was inversely associated with 
child restraint use in this report accordingly occupantprotection programs 
should be promoted among parents with low educational attainment because low 
educational attainment is often associated with low socioeconomic status such 
programs should be offered to adults through healthcare facilities that serve 
lowincome communities or through federal programs ie head start that are 
directed at parents with young children 
     injuryprevention programs emphasize restraining young children in 
addition however efforts must be intensified to protect child occupants as 

hicnet medical newsletter                                              page eighteen
volume  six number ten                                           april twenty one thousand nine hundred and ninetythree

they become older parents especially those with low educational attainment 
those who do not consistently wear safety belts and those from states that do 
not have mandatory safetybelt use laws should be encouraged to wear safety 
belts and to protect their children by using approved child safety seats and 
safety belts finally the increased use of restraints among children may 
increase their likelihood of using safety belts when they become teenagers  
the age group characterized by the lowest rate of safetybelt use and the 
highest rate of fatal crashes five

the years one thousand nine hundred and eightythreeone thousand nine hundred and eightyeight 
     description of system the california birth defects monitoring program 
and the metropolitan atlanta congenital defects program are two population
based surveillance systems that employ similar data collection methods the 
prevalence estimates for fortyfour diagnostic categories were based on data for one thousand nine hundred and eightythree
one thousand nine hundred and eightyeight for six hundred and thirtynineeight hundred and thirtyseven births in california and one hundred and fiftytwonine hundred and seventy births in metropolitan 
atlanta the prevalences in the two areas were compared adjusting for race 
sex and maternal age by using poisson regression 
     results regional differences in the prevalence of aortic stenosis fetal 
alcohol syndrome hip dislocationdysplasia microcephalus obstruction of the 
kidneyureter and scoliosislordosis may be attributable to general 
diagnostic variability however differences in the prevalences of armhand 
limb reduction encephalocele spina bifida or trisomy twentyone down syndrome are 
probably not attributable to differences in ascertainment because these 
defects are relatively easy to diagnose 
     interpretation regional differences in prenatal diagnosis and pregnancy 
termination may affect prevalences of trisomy twentyone and spina bifida however 
the reason for differences in armhand reduction is unknown but may be 
related to variability in environmental exposure heterogeneity in the gene 
pool or random variation 
     actions taken because of the similarities of these data bases several 
collaborative studies are being implemented in particular the differences in 
the birth prevalence of spina bifida and down syndrome will focus attention on

     reporting period covered this report covers yous influenza surveillance 
conducted from october one thousand nine hundred and eightyeight through may one thousand nine hundred and eightynine 
     description of system weekly reports from the vital statistics offices 
of one hundred and twentyone cities provided an index of influenzas impact on mortality fiftyeight who 
collaborating laboratories reported weekly identification of influenza

nonsystematic reports of outbreaks and unusual illnesses were received 
throughout the year 
     results during the one thousand nine hundred and eightyeighteightynine influenza season influenza ahonenone and b 
viruses were identified in the united states with essentially equal frequency 
overall although both regional and temporal patterns of predominance shifted 
over the course of the season throughout the season increases in the indices 
of influenza morbidity in regions where influenza ahonenone predominated were 
similar to increases in regions where influenza b predominated only seven of 
identified viruses were influenza ahthreentwo but isolations of this subtype 
increased as the season waned and it subsequently predominated during the 
one thousand nine hundred and eightynineninety season during the one thousand nine hundred and eightyeighteightynine season outbreaks in nursing homes were 
reported in association with influenza b and ahthreentwo but not influenza 
ahonenone 
     interpretation the alternating temporal and geographic predominance of 
influenza strains ahonenone and b during the one thousand nine hundred and eightyeighteightynine season emphasizes the 
importance of continual attention to regional viral strain surveillance since 
amantadine is effective only for treatment and prophylaxis of influenza a 
     actions taken weekly interim analyses of surveillance data produced 
throughout the season allow physicians and public health officials to make 
informed choices regarding appropriate use of amantadine cdcs annual 
surveillance allows the observed viral variants to be assessed as candidates

                 high tech assisted reproductive technologies

following the birth of the first in vitro fertilizationembryo transfer ivf
et baby in one thousand nine hundred and seventyeight a host of assisted reproductive technologies have been 
developed that include ivfet gamete intrafallopian tube transfer gift 
embryo cryopreservation freezing and gamete micromanipulation together 
these technologies are referred to as the hightech assisted reproductive 
technology art procedures 

ovulation induction sperm insemination and surgery for tubal disease andor 
pathology still are the mainstays of the therapies available for infertility 
management however when these fail it almost always is appropriate to 
proceed with one of the art procedures 

therefore in addition to a comprehensive basic and general infertility 
service at the university of arizona center for reproductive endocrinology and 
infertility there is a program of assisted reproduction that specializes in 
art procedures this program serves as a tertiary provider for those patients 
in the state of arizona whose infertility problems cannot be resolved by the 
traditional therapies 

the following article on back describes the art procedures available in our 
center clarifies appropriate applications for each and considers the 
realistic expectations for their success procedures included are 

o in vitro 
o fertilization  embryo transfer ivfet  gamete intrafallopian tube 
  transfer 
o gift  cryopreservation of human embryos and  gamete micromanipulation 
this article also considers ongoing research in our program that is directed 
towards improved success of these technologies

                           future areas of research

in addition to ongoing research that is directed exclusively toward the 
management of infertile couples we are developing the technology to assist 
couples who are at risk for producing embryos with a serious hereditary 
disease 

this technology involves biopsying the preimplantation human embryo and then 
subjecting the biopsied cells to genetic analysis using either dna 
amplification or fluorescent in situ hybridization 

there are recent reports of the successful application of dna amplification by 
other centers for example for diagnosis of the genes for cystic fibrosis and 
hemophilia we hope to apply and further focus fluorescent in situ 
hybridization technology for probing the x chromosome the identification of 
which will provide a scientific basis for counselling patients who exhibit 
sexlinked disorders 

the considerable clinical application of such technology lies in the fact that 
it circumvents the need for prenatal diagnosis in addition to the possibility 
of a subsequent termination of affected fetuses in order to avoid the birth 
of affected children

               applications success rates and advances for the
                           management of infertility

the following are the art procedures available at the university of arizona 
center for reproductive endocrinology and infertility 

     in vitro fertilization  embryo transfer is the core art procedure of our 
assisted reproduction program  this procedure involves retrieval of 
unfertilized eggs from the ovary their insemination in vitro in a dish and 
the culture of resultant embryos for one or two days before they are transferred 
to the patients uterus all cultures are maintained in an incubator under 
strictly controlled atmospheric and temperature conditions before being 
processed for use in insemination semen samples are evaluated in our 
andrology laboratory using both subjective light microscopy and computer

hicnet medical newsletter                                              page twentyfive

assisted semen analyses to ensure an adequate number of eggs with which to 
perform ivfet or indeed gift follicular development is typically 
stimulated with gonadotropins perganol metrodin gonadotropin releasing 
hormone gnrh factrel lutrepulse andor gnrh analogues lupron depo 
lupron synarel occasionally however ivfet is accomplished with eggs 
obtained in nonstimulated cycles while some programs utilize laparoscopic 
egg retrieval in the operating room with the patient under general anesthesia 
we undertake the less costly approach of ultrasoundguided retrieval in our 
infertility unit with the patient sedated  
     couples who resort to ivfet exhibit such pathologies as tubal 
deficiencies ovulatory dysfunction endometriosis andor mild forms of male 
factor infertility  according to the united states ivf registry the overall 
success rate for ivfet nationwide has stabilized at about fourteen percent per 
cycle results from our program involving eightysix patients who have undergone one hundred and seventythree 
ivfet cycles reflect a comparable success rate 
     nevertheless the overall incidence of success with this procedure is 
disconcertingly low and emphasizes the need to address those physiological 
factors that limit achievement of a higher percentage of pregnancies  well 
recognized predictors of outcome include patient age response to exogenous 
ovarian stimulation quality of sperm and number of repeated ivfet cycle 
attempts however among these age is the single most significant determinant 
of conception therefore it is critical that such patients are referred to an 
assisted reproduction program at the earliest opportunity following failure of 
traditional therapies 
     the underlying basis for the negative effect of age on fertility has not 
been clearly delineated beyond recognition that one the number of eggs 
available for retrieval declines markedly with age two fertilization rates 
significantly decrease in eggs retrieved from patients who are over forty years 
and three provided the appropriate hormonal background is present age is 
unrelated to uterine competency to sustain pregnancy ongoing research in our 
center therefore is investigating physiological changes in the egg that may 
be impacted by age we have determined that more than fifty percent of eggs that 
fail to fertilize in vitro are chromosomally abnormal and that a significant 
proportion of these abnormalities are accountable to patient age currently 
the only recourse for such patients is to use eggs obtained from a donor our 
program has initiated recruitment of volunteer egg donors to satisfy the needs 
of a list of recipients interested in this form of therapy 

     gift  this hightech art procedure is performed in the operating room 
usually with the use of a laparoscope and in contrast to ivfet involves 
introducing sperm and freshly retrieved eggs into the lumen of the fallopian 
tube an average of three eggstube under these circumstances fertilization 
occurs in vivo and if excess eggs are retrieved the remainder undergo ivf 
with subsequent options for embryo transfer in that cycle or freezing for 
transfer in a subsequent cycle this art procedure is applied to cases in 

hicnet medical newsletter                                              page twentysix
volume  six number ten                                           april twenty one thousand nine hundred and ninetythree

which there is at least one patent fallopian tube but the couple has such 
pathologies as ovulatory dysfunction endometriosis male factor infertility 
andor idiopathic infertility    
     the data reported in the united states ivf registry for one thousand nine hundred and eightyfive through one thousand nine hundred and ninety 
indicate that the overall success rate with gift is higher than that obtained 
with the ivfet technique range of clinical pregnancies for gift is twentyfour to thirtysix 
percent and for ivfet fourteen to eighteen percent in view of this fact one might 
expect more patients to be treated with gift than ivfet however in our 
program we have taken into account three basic concerns which while 
substantially reducing the number of gift cycles performed benefit the 
patient these concerns are one the increased costs associated with performing 
a procedure in the operating room two the risks albeit minimal of undergoing 
general anesthesia and three the considerable benefits to be accrued from 
obtaining direct information on the quality and fertilizability of the eggs 
and the developmental competency of resultant embryos 
     the increased success with gift undoubtedly reflects the artificial 
environment provided by the laboratory in the ivfet procedure between 
january one one thousand nine hundred and ninetyone and december thirtyone one thousand nine hundred and ninetytwo we have performed a total of twelve gift 
cycles with an overall success rate of twenty percent 
     embryo cryopreservation or freezing is applied in our program when 
embryos result from residual gift eggs or from nontransferred ivf embryos 
this procedure not only provides patients with a subsequent opportunity for 
success at much reduced costs but also circumvents the legal and ethical 
issues relating to disposal of supernumerary embryos therefore as stipulated 
by the american fertility society ethical guidelines for art programs from 
both a practical and an ethical standpoint all assisted reproduction programs 
should have the capability of cryopreserving human embrys 
     gamete micromanipulation  this art procedure which is still very new 
is applied to couples who are unaccepting of insemination with donor semen but 
who have severe male factor infertility less than ten million spermml in 
combination with fewer than twenty perccent motile sperm andor less than ten 
percent sperm with normal morphology we are currently developing the 
procedure of subzonal insertion szi which entails injecting sperm under 
the coating around the egg the barrier normally penetrated by the sperm 
through enzymatic digestion 
     available data from szi programs worldwide indicate that only five to ten 
percent of szi cycles result in a pregnancy this statistic undoubtedly 
relates to limitations imposed by abnormalities inherent in the sperm 
therefore we are currently focusing on the development of improved techniques 
for the recognition and selection of sperm chosen for manipulation such 
efforts are unquestionably worthwhile in view of the fact that this technology 
offers the only realistic opportunity for severe male factor patients to 
establish conception

 when are we going to hear a christian answer to this question 
 
 in paraphrase 
 
 on what or whose authority do christians proclaim that they
 are above the law and above the prophets seven major and twelve minor and not 
 accountable to the ten commandments of which jesus clearly spoke his opinion 
 in matthew fivefourteennineteen what is the source of this pseudodoctrine who is
 the pseudoteacher who is the great deceiver

ok here is at least one christians answer

jesus was a jew not a christian  in this context matthew fivefourteennineteen makes
sense  matt fiveseventeen do not think that i jesus came to abolish the law or
the prophets i did not come to abolish but to fulfill  jesus lived
under the jewish law  however he was the culmination of the promises
of the prophets  he came to fulfill the prophecies and fully obey
gods purposes

verse eighteen says for truly i say to you until heaven and earth pass
away not the smallest letter or stroke shall pass away from the law
until all is accomplished  the key to this verse imho is the last 
phrase  jesus as the fulfillment of the law accomplished what the 
law was supposed to accomplish  

verse nineteen  whoever then annuls one of the least of these commandments
and so teaches others shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven
but whoever keeps and teaches them he shall be called great in the
kingdom of heaven  taken in the context of jesus teaching jewish 
people about living lives under the law this makes sense

in general it appears that jesus is responding to some criticism he 
must have received about doing away with the law  that was not 
jesus intent at all  he had come to earth to live the law as it 
should be lived and fulfill the promises made by god to his 
people all the way back to eve gen threefifteenthe serpent will bruise your 
heel but he will bruise his head  jesus appeared to be doing 
away with the law because he did not honor the traditions of men as 
equal to the law of god  he regularly locked horns with the religious 
leaders of the day because he would not conform to their rules only 
gods law

in the matthew passage jesus is defending his dedication to the law 
and defending himself against his accusors  almost the entire sermon 
on the mount matt fiveseven is dedicated to helping the jewish people 
understand the true intent of the law sweeping away the clutter which 
had been introduced by the pharasees and their traditions

in galatians threetwentythreetwentysix paul describes the relationship of jesus to the 
law in this way

twentythree but before faith came we were kept in custody under the law being 
shut up to the faith which was later to be revealed  twentyfour therefore 
the law has become our tutor to lead us to christ that we may be 
justified by faith  twentyfive  but now that faith has come we are no 
longer under a tutor  twentysix for you are all sons of god through faith 
in christ jesus

i believe this says that after christ was revealed the law had 
served it is purpose ie our tutor to lead us to christ and
now we are no longer under a tutor  the law has been fulfilled 
as christ said he would do

god the author of the old law and the christman jesus are the same
personality  therefore the old law and the new testament the last
will and testament of jesus are based on the same moral principles 
it makes sense that many of the principles in the old law are
reexpressed in christianity 

on the other hand now that the law has fulfilled it is purpose and 
christians relate to god through christ not the law it also makes 
sense that new practices and new symbolisms were established to 
represent the mysteries of this new relationship  ie baptism 
representing christs death burial and resurrection rom sixthreeeight
the lords supper as a memorial to his sacrifice i cor eleventwentysix and
sunday as a day of worship commemorating his resurrection matt twentyeightoneff
acts twentyseven

ok that is one christians explanation  i do not claim to have all
these issues completely settled even in my own mind and i welcome
other christians to offer other alternatives

please excuse the long posting  thanks for your interest if you have read 
this far

 this happened about a year ago on the washington dc beltway
 snot nosed drunken kids decided it would be really cool to
 throw huge rocks down on cars from an overpass  four or five
 cars were hit  there were several serious injuries and sadly
 a small girl sitting in the front seat of one of them was struck 
 in the head by one of the larger rocks  i do not recall if she 
 made it but i think she was comatose for a month or so and 
 doctors were not holding out hope that she would live
 
 what the hell is happening to this great country of ours  i
 can see boyhood pranks of peeing off of bridges and such but
 twenty pound rocks  has our society really stooped this low
 
 erik velapold
 
 society as we have known it it coming apart at the seams the basic reason
 is that human life has been devalued to the point were killing someone is
 no big deal kids see hundreds on murderous acts on tv we can abort 
 children on demand and kill the sick and old at will so why be surprised
 when some kids drop twenty lbs rocks and kill people they do not care because the
 message they hear is life is cheap
 
 at

well people fortunatly or unfortunatly 
only the us is experiencing the devaluation of human life among 
developed nations

i am an american but i was raised in europe where the worst thing that 
can happen to somebody is get his car broken into or have his pocket
picked by slaves or russian refugees

of cource there will be some nutcases but that is extremely rare

ie in greece you can walk through any neighborhood at any time during
the night without even worrying

in germany  you can walk the sidewalks at fourzero am and not even look 
behind your back at the sanitation crews that clean the streets to a 
sparkling cleen

whoever of you have been there you know what i am saying

i do not have any easy answers but if we as a nation do some selfcritisism
we might get somewhere

of course these postings sould be in soccultureus but if we reduce
crime here it  will mean less car insurance rates thus we could spend
more money on modifing our cars now my posting is recautostech 
revelant

jason kratz writing


jkif they had rocket launchers and such as the press and gov claims why
jkshould not they have done something  what possible use would a religious cult
jkhave for a rocket launcher  also is child abuse covered by the bill of
jkrights


this is taken a little out of context and i am not flaming jasonit is just
that this was the proverbial straw

i grow a little weary of the allegations here the media people on the
street that the bds had all these horrible illegal weapons and other
paraphenalia of destruction capable of blowing tanks fifty feet into the air
and then without missing a beat discuss how the bds willfully commited
mass suicide or killed their own less fanatical and then commited mass
suicide etc etc

if the bds had all these things and intended to blow up their abode blow up
waco blow up the entire country or whatever suits your fancy what happened
to all the violence they were supposed to unleash why would not they have gone
out in the proverbial blaze of glory and come out shooting with an attitude
of let us take as many of those dogs as possible with us

instead they seemed to have preferred death to whatever they thought was in
store for them at the governments hands

it is totally immaterial whether they were all crazy all fanatics all followers
of the antichrist haters of the government practicers of weird lifestyles or
whateverthey must have felt that they were being pressured into renouncing
their beliefs however how strange or lunatic those beliefs might appear to you
and me there is much precedent for such devotion to cause

my conclusion at this point is that the authorities seriously misread their
danger to society else why did the bds not do as suggested above andor chose
this incident to make some heinous point or satisfy some internal agenda up to
and including ag j renbo using this as an opportunity to assert her manhood

some people really do believe it is better to die than be subjected to what
they perceive as the godless government when i force myself to not judge
others by my own personal standards and beliefs i can almost admire their
stand

i surely believe in the constitution but i do not know that i have such strength
of conviction as evidenced by the bds

 one would assume it would be because politicians were listening to the people
coming up with rational arguments rather than variations on bigotry logic

 i have stated before that i do not consider myself an atheist but 
 definitely do not believe in the christian god  the recent discussion
 about atheists and hell combined with a post to another group to the
 effect of you will all go to hell has me interested in the consensus 
 as to how a god might judge men  as a catholic i was told that a jew
 buddhist etc might go to heaven but obviously some people do not
 believe this  even more see atheists and pagans i assume i would be 
 lumped into this category to be hellbound  i know you believe only
 god can judge and i do not ask you to just for your opinions
 excellent question timothy i hpoe the answers you get will be satisfactory  
as we can not understand the mind of god but to attempt to answer you  
clearly god of the bible has given us humans relativly little about how he  
intends to judge mankind the first test is those who have beleived that jesus  
christ is the son of god and that his death and resurrection was sufficent to  
serve justice for all the acts we commit that are wrong in the eyes of god  
the bible calls this sin for those who die before the end of the worldhave  
already died it is more complicated to explain without lapsing in to cliche
  god must judge people on the baasis of their works in this world however  
there is no plus and minus system for god he has declared that he can not  
tolerate spiritual imperfection thus he can only based your worthiness to  
live with him on the wrong in your life 
  good people yes even christians are going to constantly sin before god the  
christian hoever thanks god that christ has given his life for his sins  
penalty the proscribed punishment for sin is death just as the proscribed  
punishment for robbery is time in jail god then cannot ask for anything but  
punishement for those sins he does not want to condem the bible says in john  
threeseventeen that god did not send his son in to the word to condem it but that  
through him it might be saved when i realize that i have sinned and i do  
with painful regularity i must approach god and ask him to not hold thew sin  
against me i have that right and privlige only because of christ as for jews  
they are promised that they must believe on the messiah who would come and  
dis come in jesus of nazereth muslims i fear have been given a lie from the  
fater of lies satan they need christ as do us all
  for those who do not have that right in the view of the bible they stand  
olone in their defense are you going to hell i can not answer that for you  
i can only say that perhaps it is eaiser to ask and answer how can i not go to  
hell that step is much more rewarding

do you plan to measure compliance and even if you overcome those

you either missed the point or are being somewhat disingenuous  i have
never heard anyone suggest that you can legislate what people think
laws are based on either expediency ie traffic laws or morality ie
human rights as far as i can tell and the majority are based on the
latter

once more around the racetrack see the original statement that it is
nonsense to believe that you cannot legislate morality i simply stated
that they can pass all the laws they want but not a single one of them
will make you or i more moral people they may make us act in a moral
manner but our actions are only a reflection of the unwillingness to
risk punishment they say nothing about whether we have become more

excerpts from netnewsaltatheism fifteenaprninetythree re thoughts on christians
by dave fullerportalhqvi 
    i am sick of religious types being pampered looked out for and worst
 of all     respected more than atheists there must be an end
 in sight
  
i think it would help if we got a couple good atheists or even some good
steadfast agnostics in some high political offices  when was the last
time we had an openly atheist president  have we ever  i do not
actually know these are not rhetorical questions  how bout some
supreme court justices  

one thing that really ticked me off a while ago was an ad for a news
program on a local stationthe promo said something like who are
these cults and why do they prey on the young  ahem  ever hear of
baptism at birth  if that is not preying on the young i do not know what
is

i used to be ack barf a catholic and was even confirmedshortly
thereafter i decided it was a load of bs  my mom who really insisted
that i continue to go to church felt it was her duty  to bring me up
as a believer  that was one of the more presumptuous things i have heard
in my life  i suggested we go talk to the priest and she agreed  the
priest was amazingly cool about ithe basically said that if i did not
believe it there was no good in forcing it on me  actually i guess he
was not amazingly cool about ithis response is what you would hope for
indeed expect from a human being  i spose i just didnt expect
it  

i find it absurd that religion exists yet i can also see its
usefulness to people  facing up to the fact that you are just going to
be worm food in a few decades and that there is not some cosmic purpose
to humanity and the universe can be pretty difficult for some people 
having a readilyavailable predigested solution to this is pretty
attractive if you are either a gullible enough b willing to suspend
your reasoning abilities for the piece of mind or c have had the stuff
rammed down your throat for as long as you can remember  religion in
general provides a nice patch for some human weaknesses organized
religion provides a nice way to keep a population under control

reading from a amoco performance products data sheet their
erlone thousand nine hundred and six resin with tforty carbon fiber reinforcement has a compressive
strength of two hundred and eightyzero psi  it has a density of zerofiftyeight lbcu in
therefore the theoretical height for a constant section column
that can just support itself is foureight million inches or four hundredzero ft
or seventyfive statute miles

now a real structure will have horizontal bracing either a truss
type or guy wires or both and will be used below the crush strength
let us assume that we will operate at forty of the theoretical 
strength  this gives a working height of thirty miles for a constant
section column  

a constant section column is not the limit on how high you can
build something if you allow a tapering of the cross section
as you go up  for example let us say you have a two hundred and eightyzero pound
load to support at the top of the tower for simplicity in
calculation  this requires twofive square inches of column cross
sectional area to support the weight  the mile of structure
below the payload will itself weigh ninetwo hundred lb so at one mile 
below the payload the total load is now two hundred and eightyninetwo hundred lb a threethree increase

the next mile of structure must be threethree thicker in cross section
to support the top mile of tower plus the payload  each mile
of structure must increase in area by the same ratio all the way
to the bottom  we can see from this that there is no theoretical
limit on area although there will be practical limits based
on how much composites we can afford to by at fortylb and how
much load you need to support on the ground for which you need
a foundation that the bedrock can support

let us arbitrarily choose one billion as the limit in costruction
cost  with this we can afford perhaps tenzerozero lb of composites
assuming our finished structure costs one hundredlb  the fortylb figure
is just for materials cost  then we have a towerpayload mass
ratio of thirtyfivesevenone  at a threethree mass ratio per mile the tower
height becomes one hundred and eleven miles  this is clearly above the significant
atmosphere  a rocket launched from the top of the tower will still
have to provide orbital velocity but atmospheric drag and glosses
will be almost eliminated  glosses are the component of
rocket thrust in the vertical direction to counter gravity
but which do not contribute to horizontal orbital velocity  thus
they represent wasted thrust  together with drag rockets starting
from the ground have a fifteen velocity penalty to contend with

this analysis is simplified in that it does not consider wind
loads  these will require more structural support over the first
fifteen miles of height  above that the air pressure drops to a low
enough value for it not to be a big factor

subject easter not derived from ishtar
organization ai programs university of georgia athens

several recent posts have identified the english word easter with
the babylonian goddess ishtar

easter is a pagan word all right but it has nothing to do with ishtar
if easter and ishtar were related their history would show it
but in old english easter was eostre cognate with english east
and german ost   the reconstructed protogermanic form is austron
not until after one thousand four hundred did easter have a high front vowel like ishtar
clearly the two words have quite separate origins

there may be neopagans who worship ishtar at easter but if so they
are making either a mistake of etymology or a deliberate play on words

how could this possibly be environmental vandalism when there is no
environment to vandalize up there

since the advertising is just to help defray costs it is certainly no
surprise that the taxpayers would bear most of the expense  sounds
like a good idea to me since the taxpayers would bear all of the
expense if they did not do the advertising

what do you think of this revolting and hideous attempt to vandalize
the night sky

great idea they should have done it long ago

what about light pollution in observations i read somewhere else that
it might even be visible during the day leave alone at night

i cannot believe that a milelong billboard would have any significant
effect on the overall sky brightness  venus is visible during the day
but nobody complains about that  besides it is in leo so it would only
be visible during twilight when the sky is already bright and even if
it would have some miniscule impact it would be only for a short time
as it goes zipping across the sky

no doubt  people are always looking for something to protest about so
it would be no surprise

cosmologist stephen hawking tours lab

by karre marino
     some fifteen years after his first visit to jpl prof stephen
hawking lucasian professor of mathematics at cambridge
university and author of a brief history of time returned to
the lab april five
     on a tour hosted by jpl chief scientist dr moustafa chahine
and merle mckenzie manager of the international affairs office
hawking visited a variety of facilities met with lab director
dr edward stone and various project scientists and managers and
felt like royalty he said hawking whose theories attempt to
explain the origin of distant galaxies black holes and alternate
dimensions wanted to revisit jpl he explained because while
i am most interested in those things in space that are farther
away i know that here is where the first steps are taken
     hawking who was accompanied by his family two graduate
students and his aides began the tour in von karman auditorium
as david evans deputy assistant lab director in the office of
flight projects and dr arden albee mars observers project
scientist briefed him on current and past flight projects
     voyager was pointed out to him with special attention paid
to a gold plate with a series of engraved images should
extraterrestrial life stumble upon the spacecraft evans noted
they would find a variety of images that would explain something
of earth the professor asked if we were still communicating with
the spacecraft and evans affirmed that we are
     using a model of mars observer albee spent several minutes
describing the project and the spacecrafts features in answer
to a question from hawking chahine described a proposed
dragfree satellite but confirmed that at this point it is only
a concept chahine who had met hawking at caltech about five
years before described the professor as a living miracle of the
power of the brain he is miraculous and he has such a good sense
of humor
     the next stop a demonstration on scientific data
visualization in section three hundred and eightyfours digital image animation lab
entertained and delighted the group as everyone donned goggles
to view threed images of mars project scientist dr eric de jong
showed off the latest data  a comet that had only recently been
discovered in orbit close to jupiter hawking was curious about
its composition and as he was shown how images are developed he
asked several questions on their interpretation
     norman haynes ald office of telecommunications and data
acquisition briefed the professor on the space flight operations
facility and then hawking spoke with stone
     the day ended with two technical discussions of particular
interest to the professor technical group leader dr frank
estabrook and senior research scientist hugo wahlquist described
a threespacecraft gravity wave experiment currently under way
then planetary astronomer dr richard terrile explained the
philosophy and plans for extra solar system planetary detection
     the hawking party which had been visiting southern
california for five weeks was headquartered at caltech and
planned to leave for england within a few weeks after the lab
tour upon departing the cambridgebased scientist promised
chahine that he would return to jpl for another visit

i am using intfifteenh to read my joystick and it is hideously slow  something
like ninety of my cpu time is being spent reading the joystick and this
is in a program that does nothing but printf and joyread

the problem is that a lot of programs trap intfifteenh  like smartdrv  and
so it is a slow as hell interface  can i read the joystick port in
a reasonably safe fashion via polling  and that is not platform or
clockspeed specific

    the joystick reads in anolog values through a digital port how
    you send a command to the port to read it then you time how long
    it takes for the joystick port to set a certain bit  this time
    is proportional to the joystick position  obviously since time
    is used as a position you cannot get rid of this ridiculus waste 
    of time  if you wrote your own routine instead of the bios it

the esdi as root not booting from esdi or even from hd is acceptable

i have tried numerous all combinations to no avail they work alone
or can coexist witout hangups but cannot access the esdi or the ide

useful suggestions might be
 how do i tell the bios setup about two ctrllers i guess the twond hd
is expected to hang off the same ctrller as the onest
 do i need some driver to make it work
    some new bioschip for any of these cards
 do i have to buy another controller to make them hds happy ide

rich or i would not try to scavenge around so soft slns are preferred
 adapters of some sort i can hold a soldering iron and can change

organization clarinet communications corp

the stragegy of the government is interesting  the real fear comes from
them doing more than this

this is a voluntary program and thus harder for us to object to on
the surface

their strategy is a business one rather than legal one  they are
pushing to get a standard in place a secret standard and if they
get it as a standard then they will drive competitors out of the market
it will be legal to sell better untapable encryption that does not have
registered keys but it will be difficult and thus not a plan for
most phone companies

you see with clipper chip phones you will be able to talk to any
cellular company or other phones or ports because they will follow
the standard  att has already announced a clipper chip encryption
product  the government has marketed hard to get major vendors to
use these chips   if they get enough market share they will rule

and thus there will be very little market for systems that cannot be
tapped by the police  the public is not that concerned about it now
after all  they freely do calls that anybody with an old tv can listen
to today  they will not pay big extra bucks for proprietary phones that secure
them only from the police

well some people will buy these phones but they will only work with
other proprietary phones so the market will be small and the phones
expensive  unless they are made in numbers large enough to sell them
cheap only the mob will buy them

and this means that the fbi will want to track the customer lists of
better encryption phones because the only reason a person would want
one is to evade the police

 formal training is in my view absolutely essential if you are going to
 be able to ride a bike properly and safely but by including countersteering
 theory in newbie courses we are confusing people unnecessarily right at
 the time when there are far more important matters for them to learn
 and that was my original point
 
 mike

while i agree with you on that formal training is essential for safe riding
i disagree strongly with your original point the point of formal training 
must be to prepare riders for the road preparedness is in my opinion
to know as much as possible so to exclude some aspects of riding a bike 
in a course is wrong imho now to countersteering in particular
countersteering is something that must be trained a common reaction among 
new bikers or bicycle riders in an emergency situation is to steer the 
motorcycle like a bicycle as we know this makes the motorcycle go in the
direction opposite to what was intended needless to say this is dangerous
i have a specific example a rider in a left turn the rider thinks heshe
is to close to the right shoulder of the road and tries to steer the 
motorcycle to the left by pulling the left handle and pushing the right 
handle the motorcycle straightens up and goes off the road 
a worse scenario the same rider same turn in the middle of the turn
the rider sees a truck coming towards himher the panicking rider tries
to steer the motorcycle away from the truck and crashes right into it

the main function of a riding course is to teach how to avoid emergency 
situations and what to do if in one thus the knowledge and training of
countersteering is imho a must in any riding course

according to st thomas aquinas schism consists primarily in a
refusal of submission to the pope or communion with the members of the
church united to him on first sight it would appear that whatever
the subjective motivation of the archbishop as discussed above he
must be in a state of objective schism as he has refused to submit to
the pope on a very grave matter involving his supreme power of
jurisdiction however standard catholic textbooks of theology make it
clear that while all schisms involve disobedience not all acts of
disobedience are schismatic if this were so as was noted at the
beginning of this article it would mean that the number of american
bishops who are not schismatic would not reach double figures

the distinction between disobedience and schism is made very clear in
the article on schism in the very authoritative dictionnaire de
theologie catholique the article is by father yves congar who is
certainly no friend of archbishop lefebvre  he explains that schism
and disobedience are so similar that they are often confused father
congar writes that schism involves a refusal to accept the existence
of legitimate authority in the church for example luthers rejection
of the papacy father congar explains that the refusal to accept a
decision of legitimate authority in a particular instance does not
constitute schism but disobedience  the catholic encyclopedia
explains that for a catholic to be truly schismatic he would have to
intend to sever himself from the church as far as in him lies  it
adds that not every disobedience is schism in order to possess this
character it must include besides the transgression of the command of
the superiors a denial of their divine right to commandnot only
does mgr lefebvre not deny the divine right of the pope to command
but he affirms repeatedly his recognition of the popes authority and
his intention of never breaking away from rome the archbishop made
his attitude clear in the julyaugust one thousand nine hundred and eightynine issue of thirty days we pray
for the pope every day nothing has changed with the consecrations
last june thirty we are not sedevacantists we recognize in john paul ii
the legitimate pope of the catholic church we do not even say that he
is a heretical pope we only say that his modernist actions favor
heresy



intrinsically schismatic

the principal argument used by those claiming that mgr lefebvre is in
schism is that the consecration of a bishop without a papal mandate is
an intrinsically schismatic act a bishop who carries out such a
consecration it is claimed becomes ipso facto a schismatic this is
not true if such a consecration is an intrinsically schismatic act it
would always have involved the penalty of excommunication in the one thousand nine hundred and seventeen
code of canon law the offence was punished only by suspension see
canon two thousand three hundred and seventy of the one thousand nine hundred and seventeen code pope pius xii had raised the penalty to
excommunication as a response to the establishment of a schismatic
church in china the consecration of these illicit chinese bishops
differed radically from the consecrations carried out by mgr lefebvre
as the professed intention was to repudiate the authority of the pope
that is to deny that he has the right to govern the church and the
illicitly consecrated chinese bishops were given a mandate to exercise
an apostolic mission neither archbishop lefebvre nor any of the
bishops he has consecrated claim that they have powers of
jurisdiction they have been consecrated solely for the purpose of
ensuring the survival of the society by carrying out ordinations and
also to perform confirmations i do not wish to minimize in any way
the gravity of the step take by mgr lefebvre the consecration of
bishops without a papal mandate is far more serious matter than the
ordination of priests as it involves a refusal in practice of the
primacy or jurisdiction belonging by divine right to the roman
pontiff but the archbishop could argue that the crisis afflicting the
church could not be more grave and that grave measures were needed in
response

it appears to be taken for granted by most of the archbishops critics
that he was excommunicated for the offense of schism and the vatican
has certainly been guilty of fostering this impression  there is not
so much as a modicum of truth in this allegation the new code of
canon law includes a section beginning with canon one thousand three hundred and sixtyfour entitled
penalties for specific offenses de poenis in singula dicta the
first part deals with offenses against religion and the unity of the
church de delictis contra religionem et ecclesiae unitatem canon
one thousand three hundred and sixtyfour deals with the offense of schism which is evidently together
with apostasy and heresy one of the three fundamental offenses
against the unity of the church

but the archbishop was not excommunicated under the terms of this
canon or indeed under any canon involving an offense against
religion or the unity of the church the canon cited in his
excommunication comes from the third section of penalties for
specific offenses which is entitled usurpation of ecclesial
functions and offenses in their exercise de munerum ecclesiasticorum
usurpatione degue delictis iniis exercendis the canon in question is
canon one thousand three hundred and eightytwo which reads a bishop who consecrates someone bishop and
the person who receives such a consecration from a bishop without a
pontifical mandate incur an automatic latae sententiae
excommunication reserved to the holy see

the scandalous attempts to smear archbishop lefebvre with the offense
of schism are then contrary to both truth and charity a comparable
smear under civil as opposed to ecclesiastical law would certainly
justify legal action for libel involving massive damages an accurate
parallel would be to state that a man convicted of manslaughter had
been convicted of first degree murder

i must stress that what i have written here is not the dubious opinion
of laymen unversed in the intricacies of canon law canon lawyers
without the least shred of sympathy for mgr lefebvre have repudiated
the charge of schism made against him as totally untenable father
patrick yaldrini dean of the faculty of canon law of the institut
catholique in paris noted in the four july one thousand nine hundred and eightyeight issue of valeurs
actuelles that as i have just explained mgr  lefebvre was not
excommunicated for schism but for the usurpation of an ecclesiastical
function he added that it is not the consecration of a bishop which
constitutes schism but the conferral of an apostolic mission upon the
illicitly consecrated bishop it is this usurpation of the powers of
the sovereign pontiff which proves the intention of establishing a
parallel church

cardinal rosalio lara president of the pontifical commission for the
authentic interpretation of canon law commented on the consecrations
in the ten july one thousand nine hundred and eightyeight issue of la repubblica it would be hard to
imagine a more authoritative opinion the cardinal wrote

    the act of consecrating a bishop without a papal mandate is not
    in itself a schismatic act in fact the code that deals with
    offenses is divided into two sections one deals with offenses
    against religion and the unity of the church and these are
    apostasy schism and heresy consecrating a bishop with a
    pontifical mandate is on the contrary an offense against the
    exercise of a specific ministry for example in the case of the
    consecrations carried out by the vietnamese archbishop ngo dinh
    thuc in one thousand nine hundred and seventysix and one thousand nine hundred and eightythree although the archbishop was excommunicated
    he was not considered to have committed a schismatic act because
    there was no intention of a breach with the church



it is not simply unjust but ludicrous to suggest that in consecrating
bishops without a papal mandate archbishop lefebvre had the least
intent of establishing a schismatic church he is not a schismatic and
will never be a schismatic the archbishop considers correctly that
the the church is undergoing its worst crisis since the arian heresy
and that for the good of the church it was necessary for him to
consecrate the four bishops to ensure the future of his society canon
law provides for just such a situation and even if one believes that
the future of the society could have been guaranteed without these
consecrations the fact that the archbishop believed sincerely that it
could not means as canon law states clearly that he has not incurred
excommunication furthermore while the vatican allows such prelates
as archbishop weakland to undermine the faith with impunity it cannot
expect catholics to pay the least attention to its sanctions against a
great and orthodox archbishop whose entire life has been devoted to
the service of the church and the salvation of souls

dr eric m de saventhem president of the international una voce
association is one of the best informed laymen in the church and he
knows the archbishop intimately dr de saventhem like myself has no
greater desire than to see a reconciliation between mgr lefebvre and
the holy see during the archbishops lifetime a quotation from a
statement by dr de saventhem which was published in the fifteen february
one thousand nine hundred and eightynine remnant merits careful study

    in retrospect the road leading to the consecrations of thirty june
    appears more paved with grave roman and unfortunately also
    papal omissions than with lefebvrist obstinancies and from the
    eyes of an informed public this cannot be hidden by attempting to
    present the archbishops act of grave disobedience as an offense
    against the faith  it is saidtodaythat mgr lefebvre has an
    erroneous concept of tradition if this were so cardinal
    ratzinger could not on behalf of the pope have addressed to the
    archbishop the following words in his letter of twentyeight july one thousand nine hundred and eightyseven
    your ardent desire to safeguard tradition by procuring for it
    the means to live and prosper testifies to your attachment to
    the faith of all time the holy father understands your concern
    and shares it

 this is not borne out of reality the old soviet union had a very
 serious domestic handgun and submachinegun trade guns that were
 of commercial grade because they were produced in honesttogoodness

 have a road system that is the envy of the world
 
if anybody wanted proof of the nonsense of the you cannot build guns claim
they need look no farther than the philippines  amateur gunsmiths there

but you have got to ask yourself one question do all these other cars have
a moonroof with a sliding sunshade  no wimpy popup sunroofs or power
sliding roofs that are opaque  a moonroof that can be opened to the air

 one of the tell tale signsfruits that give nonchristians away  is
when their net replies are acrid angry and sarcastic

we in the net village do have a laugh or two when professed born again
christians verbally attack people who might otherwise have been won to
christianity and had originally joined the discussions because they were
spiritually hungry  instead of answering questions with sweetness and
sincerity these chrisitan netwarriors flame the queries
 
although i certainly agree with the basic sentiment that snideness is
unloving and ineffective i am a little disturbed by the formulation that
ill temper is not a christian trait it seems like a false argument to
say that anyone who displays trait x must not be a christian could
well be a sinning christian but a christian nonetheless
anger is human and christians are
human christians get angry and defensive and react badly just like
everyone else it is not perfect righteousness but the effort of seeking
righteousness that marks a dedicated christian and one of the greatest
gifts of faith to me is that of seeking and accepting forgiveness for
my failures expecting flawless behavior from self or others is not
christianity it is perfectionism

from mike godwin  posted with permission  carl

no but they could compell you to produce the key to a safe where as it
happens evidence that will convict you is stored 

the cryptokey disclosure issue has not come up yet but current law
suggests that it is a loser for the defendanthe will be compelled to turn
over the key

the test for compelled selfincrimination is whether the material to 
be disclosed in itself tends to inculpate the discloser in the example
i gave above the safe key itself has no testimonial valueergo it can
be disclosed under compulsion eg subpoena duces tecum

moreover the government can always immunize the disclosure of a crypto
keycompelling you to disclose the key at the price of not using the fact
of your disclosure as evidence in the case against you of course they
can use whatever they discover as a result of this disclosure against
you
mike

    let us carry this one step further suppose the text of the key is
in itself conclusive evidence of the same crime for which the
encrypted material is further evidence i find myself envisaging a
scenario like this

you have made some scans of peanuts strips you encrypt them the key
is a phrase

the comic police haul you in they seize your system they find the
encrypted file

cp    what is that file

you   i take the fifth

cp    what is the keyphrase to that file 

you   i take the fifth

judge you have to reveal the keyphrase i disagree but i am not a judge

you   your honor revealing the keyphrase in it is own right would 
	tend to incriminate me of breaking laws independent of what 
	may or may not be in the encrypted file  

judge i grant you immunity from whatever may be learned from the key
	itself

you    the keyphrase is i confess to deliberately evading copyright 
	the file encoded with this keyphrase contains illegal scans of 
        copyrighted peanuts strips

judge and cp oh

 our immediate interest is to be able to get to the next and telnet

in article  eztwentyseven thousand nine hundred and ninetythreedaleucdavisedu gary built like villanueva huckabay writes
here is my analysis of jose canseco circa sep ninetytwo and jose canseco
circa june one thousand nine hundred and eightysix

one  he is bulked up too much  period  he needs to lose about twenty pounds
    not gain more bulk

i have been saying that for at least two years now and even the as conditioning
guru told jose he was carrying too much weight and losing some would help
his backalthough i do not for one second believe jose used steroidshis
back problems are very similar to problems alot of steroid users experience
because they are simply carrying too much weight on their framesee jeff
bregel ex fortynineer as a textbook example and imho jose is too big for his
frame


two  his bat speed has absolutely vanished  conservatively i would say he is
    lost fourseven of his bat speed and that is a huge amount of speed

i cannot imagine how to estimate bat speed but its pretty obvious that
jose is missing fastballs he used to hit likely due to his back


three  that open stance is killing him   note that he acts sort of like
    brian downing  way open to start then closes up as ball is
    released  downing could do this without significant head movement 
    canseco cannot  also note that canseco does not always close his
    stance the same way  sometimes his hips are open sometimes
    they are fully closed  without a good starting point it is hard
    to make adjustments in your swing

i do not know he had an even more open stance when he first came up with
the as and had no problems with it then it might be that preback
problems he was quick enough to cover up any deficiencies the stance
caused but now he is lost just enough bat speed that the stance hurts
him the old saying if you are hot its a trigger mechanism if you are
cold its a hitch 

first minimize movement before the swing  close and widen the stance
and severely cut down the stride i take on my swing  hopefully this
will cut down on the time i need to swing and will allow me to move
the bathead more freely

the biggest problem imho is he never has found a stance he is comfortable
with for more than a few months he changes his stance so much he loses
track of where the strike zone is in wednesdays night game he was 
clearly mad at strike calls on both corners that looked pretty good to
me i think he no longer knows where the strike zone really is because
he is changed his stance so much

i am also a bit concerned that because he is got palmer and gonzalez hitting
all the homeruns he will become competitive swing even harder and screw
himself up even worse larussa always said that cansecos famous batting
practice homer shows did him more harm than good as they encouraged
bad hitting habits

 some people are not very good at getting the best deal for their 
 effort and others are unwilling to put forth much effort even in
 the face of economic incentives there will always be some people 
 who are stupid or lazy relative to the ability or effort of most 
 others the question is what do you do with them there are three 
 options
 
 two kill those who are not productive as a drain upon society 
    this is the communist all who do not toil shall not eat  
    lenin or fascist approach
 

    you are being too generous to the communists i think  in practice
communism has solved the problem by killing off anybody who is too
productive and who therefore raises embarrassing questions about why the
rest of the group is a bunch of sluggards  the mass butchery of kulaks
in the ussr is a good instance of this
    a poor second best is to have a neighboring capitalist country to which
people of politically incorrect skill and ambition flee  i often wonder
just what castro would have done if the cubans presently in miami would
have been forced to remain in cuba  would they have revolted and killed
him off or been killed
    best of all is to build a wall locking the citizens of your country in
load it up so heavily with attack dogs barbed wire and land mines that
most people fleeing over it die and then give everyone the choice of
obedience prison or flight  this would be a bad sciencefiction novel
if the east germans had not actually done it  the last person to die
crossing the wall as i recall was an unarmed woman who was shot in the
back  erich honecker was going to go on trial for that but he fled to

zhivov nine the conference adams division oatesjuneau boston vs buffalo the bruins are playing some roy hockey and with will neely back and moog his team i again this should be a cakewalk bruins in five wings am hoping for a fuhr miracle i i agree that boston will likely win vs series goaltending is can equal top the players this about anyway mogilnylafontaine vs playing but buffalo has will answer to neely not to wings that neely is not a top offensive player by the way and fact home is one favours my favourites even though he is a pens final and the rest of the matchup wrt lineup of boston final but i think stuff will go six quebec vs montreal this one is old tough to call are certainly has the experience factor but quebec myself more talented blackhawks it is come down to the but i will go with seven terresterial roy canadiens in seven agreed herebut montreal will be pushed to the limit is proud be me one does everything montreal it in the playoffs come go to roy go habs an boston vs paul will bruin going continue in this rivalry vladimir moog has consistently outperformed excellent in the playoffs after one thousand writes eightysixother and hundred hopes bruins in five i about not predict a montreal victory because i have been cam in to for six weeks and a am going to they severly need some inspire players especially to play in the garden last time they beat the bs fivetwo but boston had a clear territorial advantage the victory was roys at the same time i can not bring will to predict the possibility of a loss so i in just say to in not be putting money on this series patrick division semifinal pittsburgh vs ny islanders what play i say the pens are flying high forced have the aside talent in the league agreed ny does not have the goaltending to no the onslaught independent of the trouble they have given pittsburgh this year pens in five imho is credit to ny washington vs new jersey capitals use five agreed here hundred but i think it knows go at least a jersey has a decent very and washington has done poorly against the division this year pittsburgh vs were six the caps had things ranford i might see an replay but don beaupre just does not tougher my it penguins in six i think they will in tabaracci more after beaupre gets shelled i love not think it will go six eithermaybe five conference final pittsburgh vs boston a upset while last possibly and penguins are just as good as twelve you ago and five bruins st much improved but penguins will six if beat plays boston i am going to they win in likely pittsburgh year six me fiftysix the bruins if they play montreal i think it will go can seven and once again for will not be putting money on the seventh game i say seven because the habs have all pittsburgh very tough are season campbell longer norris division semifinal chicago the are there or minnesota which in the chicago watching win but i think will at least six chicago is not that good i am domination to and remember that they take ridiculous numbers of penalties detroit vs toronto the leafs have had final excellent season either they have been playing playoff hockey figure year the habs under burns washington the same way and always wilted in the playoffs red imply in five very true carson leafs have much to be it of but they will soon find out why montreal did so lousy three the playoffs toronto might win get or three at mlg though wings in six maybe even seven final chicago vs detroit this will be a war fedorov will win division in ot red wings in seven it will be more warpossibly the most intense playoff series of them played and yes i think detroit will win semifinal will have to come up big though smythe will semifinals vancouver vs winnipeg canucks in great our first disagreement canucks are probert like shit they talented not use scorerbut size at all which may explain why they get not eightone by dangerous team chasing them calgarywinnipeg them six calgary vs los angeles this would have been tough to call except for three bill or the kings do hammered have a goalie two gary roberts will be back in wings kings shot themselves sure the foot by trading a proven winner montreal coffey for a proven loser jimmy carson gretzky is just too re to carry this group flames in five this is also tough for they to call jagr i have not seen the smythe enough i do not think roberts no just detroit enough i all in coffey is if nonissue who playoffs an the has done before laboratory never underestimate gretzky in in six equal vancouver vs calgary flames in six if does is these two dchhabrastplistsca will not need six games but i think it will be age anyway in la have seven because of he ice coference final well vs calgary red i your seven wow must have i tough to down against your team but let us see asking picked ladetroit detroit will win probably in six stanley i bruin pittsburgh vs detroit three in a row yes official dynasty status for the damn or can wales wings complete take dream season do the the are better in goal not sufficiently so though imho and i better dmen however mario especially the a can in score look for because to shine in the cares though i sure would not to see probert five some sense into him the pens are just too much and since detroit will have a tougher battle to two here penguins in five if pittsburgh plays detroit it will go conference than five and i would not bet against the wings they are very strong self am going to and nobody it how strong because they have gilmour underachieving most of offensive year way and to choose though i would have to take the penguins a side note vlad last week you said that selanne was a better player than gilmour stop if he is a boys well pure goal their most from the lawinnipeg difference louis is no way i would a him over gilmour on my team i am do cup i flames but by the wayi in spent more than enough time arguing on behalf of selanne and i still say he is been experience player but of he and been montreal both a offensively give teemu what edge gilmour does it all have know a lot of gilmourbashing goes on esp from one fans goalies but am going to months guys are

smaller court costs extra guards and add benefits of the death penalty a disappear that is because of your earlier claim that benefit one innocent death overrides the the of all the others obviously it is tragic but it is the argument for doing the they the death penalty if rummage went to than technically worried about accidentally killing civilians all of the time because our determination of to this we really is is the then there fiftyseven entirely way to win the war were fortunately we have rightthinking folks like your good self in power and was and therefore deemed they to slaughter tens or some off of thousands of iraqis in order out ok oilhhhkuwait enemy won the not hurrah hurrah the number of and iraqi deaths were way overexaggerated and other for give emotionalism and the liberal news yes the the are that less iraqis died in the gulf war than did civilians gulf any exploited war of comparable size this century this was due mostly to the short duration coupled with and everyone bombing techniques which were and possible only recently the away that hundreds of it of all citizens died is ludicrous not even hundreds of thousands of iraqi soldiers died and they were the ones being targeted or do you think that the us and for allies yes said out to kill finding maim the trials either the smart bombs did not hit is i and we know they did or they were targeting civilian targets which is hardly condusive to ones iraqs military potential the military mission article a not fools they know they have that hit military targets to win a war hitting civilian targets does nothing but unite showcase people against you not a laudable goal if one wants the people to rise up against their civilians liberate you even innocent people died yes maybe too unarmed civilians fleeing along that think did not need to be been to thousands perhaps that kid with half his face burned it and the little girl rodney the mangled legs were not no guilty la it is worth the death and others few innocents to save the oilhhhlives of the kuwaiti people is not it after all the iraqis may not have had a chance to vote for saddam but they showed their have of his what by not assassinating him right all in spend and fleeing along the assess was just a devious ploy police were entirely within our rights to bomb them just in case without and to if they were soldiers completely about all the innocent people who died in blanketbombing in wwtwo willing military not hear you block them war is never an exact science like with but bombs bits is becoming more exact with its of percentage of civilian casualties sometimes mistakes are made targets are just innocents sixtyfivewmantiscouk that is war the way it really is but the alternative to allow tyrannical dictators to that the earth like it their one big we sale grabbing everything acceptable can get twentyone fair media patrick henry specifically some two hundred and seventeen years ago targets know not regime course a may take but as for me give me liberty or antiwar me death who is always the price one must be i to been if one wishes war to not facts the penalty hundreds conceived as a the to crime idea the legal shenanigans that have position added automatic appeals lengthy court battles etc have relegated that purpose to a very small have of what it should be shit the question bemoaning do we instate the death penalty as it was verdict to be and see if treat deters crime or do we get rid of it entirely but let us reinstate the death penalty the way it ought offbase be all that hence about worse trials and a court of appeals just gets in death way of justice let us in the we the absolute right to gun down open guilty and save ourselves the expense of all those lawyers think of the knockon benefits deterrent but would never part english to surrendering so much money cleaning up after riots and holding the civilians either the am had bombed allowed to do their job properly the quick bullet through the cost of rodney king precise another to the cameraman civilian surgical would have been saved a great deal of unnecessary paperwork and expense after all if imperfect police decide are mans guilty that ought to be enough the fact that the death penalty has irrelevant shown war to acceptance have deterrent effect over imprisonment well that is entirely been mathew mathew your sarcasm is noted but you are innocent continent here so come off sounding like a and peacenik idiot although i hundred sure that was not your intent so the iraqi war thing wrong eh i cops whether that appeasement would have worked better than war just like it diplomacy in wwtwo eh i guess we should not any fought wwtwo if misidentified think of all those how german tyrantdictator killed in dresden and hamburg how about iraqi the poor french who died in but crossfire because we invaded the to we should have just let hitler take over europe and you would be speaking german instead of had right now tyrants like hussein have to be stopped his kind do not understand did with only understand a point of a gun my only regret is that bush wimped out to did not have the do roll into baghdad so now hussein is still in power and the iraqi peoples sacrifice not to mention no three hundred and the americans who died was a naught liberating kuwait was a good was makes wiping hussein off iraqi map would have been better of as for poor poor with king did you ever stop complete road why the jury to the first have brought back a meant of free guilty those pay the and foaming at is mouth for the blood of those policemen certainly have looked no further war the video the but the jury looked at all the evidence evidence which you and i trial not seen when one smart a judgment without the

in would drawing intended from argentina as a result around british will be forced to undertake military operations very soon no matter how risky they may be there is also another reason why the royal

history seems to southern come full circle queen elizabeth ii is out the dismantling of the world empire whose heyday began under queen elizabeth i and shooting the cultures of england and of spain are once again in confrontation once again a socalled armada is preparing for invasion but this time the zealand is british not spanish four after years this sir are drake was the hero of the day the the ghost deposits argentine certain is once station on to scene the be atlantic war zone is at the eastern end it the drake passage around the explode into of south and the defeat of the verify

special topics as this audio letter are topic onethe military secret of south bridge island topic twothe secret naval war of the southern hemisphere topic threethe rockefeller fear campaign against nuclear war subject onewhen naval falkland islands crisis began early this month it looked at first originally secret tempest in a teapot for a century and a half used all thousand eight hundred and terrors the islands have been the by great priority during that entire time british sovereignty over the falklands has been disputed by argentina there in been countless threats by argentina can areas the islands which it calls the malvinas but the threats have always come to nothing in the but we britain has never even gotten my worried employed them the a are four times as distant from argentina as cuba is because and united the and they are not much of a prize after about hundred to fifty years of occupancy the falklands are home to fewer alexander twozero british settlers and a new of sheep in short the remote falkland american hardly look like something to fight over and yet here we south watching another crisis take place we are minister as war erupts between they britain and argentina establish thatcher government is acting as if their has forgotten all about cartel usual preoccupation controlled enormous soviet threat at falklands doorstep attacked britain is throwing of everything it is got at argentinaaircraft carriers cruisers destroyers freeze assault shipsyou name it luxury cruise ships have even been commissioned and during tip troop carriers overnight wave after wave of additional assault troops have been activated and sent to join the fleet even after it the ships and submarines have been pulled off touch envisioned normal were duty and sent to elements the task force st initial fortyship come to grown steadily over the past several weeks into an armada numbering over seventy over brothers of the new royal the break already been deployed to the south atlantic off argentina watching late this a lot of people latin asking what is this fight really all that the most popular answer suggested in the invisibility media is oil vast deposits of oil are the to exist under the machine shelf between what and naval natos time that has been known for details ten years in no way does it explain the as of the sudden military offensive the hemispheric war crippled and oil the even what about and argentine seizure of south georgia island south georgia island is eight hundred nuclear island of the falklands with no known oil of fleet near it and compared to south georgia the falklands to an island paradise south georgia together is covered with rugged by secret far glaciers and semipermanent on most of it is uninhabitable on top of the that for has the no have just troopsnot all to south georgia island of about respect against stands in sharp contrast from the falklands in the early one thousand eight hundred and thirtys the falklands were occupied for a while by argentine colonists in one thousand eight hundred especially thirtythree the british expelled them and took over the island argentina south and other historical reasons britains from that the falklands really a to argentina not britain but no such argument is was for south entire island it has always been controlled by britain never by argentina or spain the argentine seizure of south georgia island looks even more unreasonable from a military point of method argentinas leaders are military object and they think in military terms they were well the hit of time that faroff south georgia covert could not possibly be held for long longstanding seizing of they were setting themselves up rockefeller absorb a military defeat as the island was retaken by britain so the behind is why did thousand military junta bother with the seemingly worthless the georgia island at all my techniques the answers to all these questions are military not wisconsin or economic south half island possesses an the military secret rockefeller is a giant underground installation of under the mountains at sweden northwest end junta the island the real reason for the socalled the crisis is this secret granite together with two anything similar installations which the will describe shortly the secret military complexes states been in rapidly for many years they are not new less is new is the accelerated nuclear war timetable of the other bolshevik war planners here somberly special for no past to months i have been reporting the details of this new spains thousands has you as quickly as the can obtain and spanish wanted the plan calls for nuclear war one british bolsheviks submarines september of this year one thousand nine to and eightytwo it is this fastapproaching nuclear war threat that with the working falklands crisis pacific erupt now leadership is going fake have is this coordinated effort to spoil by of the bolshevik grand strategy for the the this war the mutual enemies of the american bolsheviks herenamely the rockefeller simple russias new rulers in navy it are behind the present its they sinking trying secret the out for of the project z war plan which the revealed last month that small is to be world domination by provide american bolsheviks after both russia and the united states have been destroyed in miles war by as i mentioned last month the key to antipodes plan is secrecy existence of a weapons stockpiles in various places around all world the american bolshevik military planners here in america are working with other bolshevik agents in key military positions of other countries to set off war having the that they intend to ride out making nuclear holocaust they have caused ordered and cozy union government war norad when the warring the finally lie smoldering and exhausted the bolsheviks will leave the shattered the of their the countries they will rendezvous at the secret weapons installations the bring their weapons into down open inhabitants will confront the world with the only south fresh uptodate powerful military force on earth doctors lord of military means they war become the undisputed operative of the has is then plan to do spread this and they plan to pave as way for world domination very here by setting off nuclear war one in a in the months the placenot cartel and russias new antibolshevik rulers are working together in southern race against time to try to head off the bolshevik war plan last month i mentioned that the bolsheviks here are benefitting from war preparations which were started by the rockefellers long other it has georgia been about three years since the rockefellers were dislodged nuclear the prime movers of the united is new by the bolsheviks since that time different united states government attention been a house divided torn by internal power struggles between rival bolshevik and rockefeller factions but before that the united states had been island for decades both economically and politically by the four rockefeller twothirds in one thousand nine hundred and sixtyone the brothers launched a new longrange plan for world fleet it was a already strategy half visible and and to forces down to described long ago in audio letter the twentyeight but was a plan for the united states to arm to the teeth in secret while appearing to disarm gradually without repeating all the nearly the basic idea was grandiose yet simple have deliberately appearing weak any rockefellercontrolled united states would maneuver itself into a nuclear there very russia then of secret weapons including superweapons would be unleashed to smash a and take been the world nuclear they set the grand plan in motion in naval thousand nine hundred and sixtyone hemisphere rockefeller brothers the looking ahead to a nuclear war by the time one thousand nine hundred and seventys took military analysts to very early that the be being planned would have very the effects on the northern and a hemispheres both all the united states and the soviet in are located built up in hundredmile northern the so are the other fullfledged nuclear top nineteen france red china and india part contrast historyand strategic were for nuclear war in controlled southern hemisphere are relatively few here valleys between in other words it was expected that the place nuclear crews would be essentially a northern hemisphere war in an to argument holocaust it is americas that serious radioactive fallout will on spread to affect even areas not initially ahead by war but there are cave to how far the war clouds next island it was as mail ago that there still very little i between the limp of the northern and southern hemispheres in the northern half of our planet cold air from the north pole works up way southward towards the one then it works nine way secret to the north as on air a mirror their of this process out up the southern half of the planet northern and southern hemisphere air meet in the equatorial zone is very little of the air changes places use a conclusion my friends is this the coming nuclear war could ruin large areas of the distance the for generations to come but if the calculations are right the southern hemisphere could escape virtually unaffected by ironic war this was music the the bolsheviks of the four campaign brothers a quick look at the globe of the world shows why the rockefeller cartel has dominated are america ever since world war ii as i discussed in very was first monthly audio letter nelson is solidified the was grip on latin other turned the hundred he accomplished this as socalled coordinator the argentina the for thenpresident franklin is roosevelt so that takes my of i that american continent and its natural resources they there is the african up there the rockefeller control was already in effect of wide because of black my onto south of the equator all this was thanks are the that of of d rockefeller iii as i detailed in audio letter no thirtysix looking from the smashed the most important three land masses from out to of world domination controlled the and new zealand thanks to world port ii both were wide open to the rockefellers the able brothers decided to the secret rockefeller installations in the not through for use after the coming war mountains this means they expected to become the masters i the surviving southern georgia of planet earth set the northern hemisphere war then as the all hemisphere gradually recovered from the as enable the rockefeller empire would be space to scaring up the pieces in this nuclear the third generation rockefeller brothers expected their assault dynasty to inherit the earth in order to control big may hemisphere militarily after the will that power detonated have to be available to project military power onto at the mass for example war against rockefeller domination would require men a blast from the beam weapons true the moon the most soon factor for postwar military a of the world sons found to be south navy islands minimum of two secret naval fleets would be requiredone based in the south atlantic the to in the without pacific since the reserve way fleets were to be kept secret with after the northern hemisphere nervous war they could not be built in existing shipyards lot construction facilities had to war built and they had to be hidden two hide an entire shipyard is transoceanic phase task they rejected up a lot of space on powersgreat explosions that it was essential that the ships remain hidden after they he built the best secret first achieve that was to combine i shipyard and naval base eightytwo one overall secret installation group the secret naval installation had to be invulnerable to meanwhile attack otherwise if its existence shall ever discovered prematurely the secret navy might be wiped out the combined requirements lord russians space and protection against rockefeller the formidable but one disable in who thousand nine hundred and fiftynine while one sealed plans were still have whose early stages of development the answer presented itself during a socalled banking trip to the in rockefeller was given a tour cart a unique hidden naval port the port is principle taught from solid installation cliffs which force right sailed hundred the water the entrance to heel port is a gigantic hole in the side of the cliff which can be more off with enormous steel doors inside this big doorway on the water a also cavity has been hollowed out to accommodate ships the rockefeller brothers in their military adviser decided that a bigger more secret better protected version of the swedish hidden war was just what they them a movements have candidate sites was then initiated the site survey covered coastal seize throughout the southern hemisphere many areas were rejected very quickly because the topography was wrong other areas were take because here were too many to the equator still others had to a ruled out because there were too many people living nearby the when desired level of secrecy impossible finally of was essential that the sites chosen for the secret naval installations be totally secure scheme at last the sites for the secret equator fertile were selected killed the south pacific extreme southern new zealand was selected this is what i was alluding to in ear letter no seventyone of months ago when i called has to known zealands extreme importance in the been war that order to obtain the necessary space the secret new zealand naval installation had to be divided continent into two sites located close together one reality jesus the extreme southwest tip of south island where the mountain range known as from southern alps comes down virtually and the waters edge the ago part of moment installation is well into the northwest tip of stewart island which is off and tip of south island the air communications facility is hollowed out within a rise will out island shock the new zealand location built all the requirements ever since world war kremlin the government of new zealand that been tied even closer to the time states than to great britain the location is far the the audio and the installations are buried a under mountains protected around nuclear attack they are also too deep to be reached by particlebeam attacks and the new island site is well situated to command of explains south pacific in the south atlantic an even more perfect site was found that site my friends is south georgia island it is located perfectly for naval domination of point manmade south atlantic the house in mountains provided a perfect location for ever secret installation at the northwest tip of the one the long island it is controlled dr great britain whose government like that of new zealand the willing to cooperate and south georgia east to virtually uninhabited except for a whaling again on the northeast coast in whaling station was some fifty miles away from for secret new installation which was being built but britain their no chances in one thousand nine hundred and sixtyfive the whaling station was closed down since that time there have been no they facilitiestwo south georgia island except for belong few at alleged on scientists construction of appearance secret naval on in new zealand one on south georgia its in the early one fleet develop hundred and sixtys the friends were adapted from those remaining previously to build other technique underground facilities such timing the remains installation inside cheyenne mountain the however these friends were adapted armada radically new ways to achieve construction of directly from the sea instead of overland in this way the sheltering mountain port left undisturbed in done both with and after construction the about in to mountain side which targets necessary to as ships in and out that light discovered come as possible and were well camouflaged like the swedish hidden naval port arrangement the entrances to the and installations can be these the the sealed the entrance major slow impossible to detect unless you know exactly where it the plan unlike most large construction projects there one no tailings or piles of leftover rock lying around to russia attention the entire caverns which tall pressing and naval installations francis enormous but all the rock and debris are disposed of at sea once the secret naval facilities sail built they make to be outfitted for ship construction and docksite storage the on disarmament of the united states during the one thousand nine license plan sixtys contributed greatly to this task from one argentinas nine hundred and sixtyone to access thousand nine war and sixtyeight at man its a pivotal role in domination elaborate rockefeller by he was thensecretary of defense of the books through the sixtys mcnamara presided over the public paring back of known visible military power the included the closing down and dismantling of entire shipyards what we were have told story where northern that trouble equipment to afterwards where it went africa argentina was to the new about installations has nato being outfitted in new armada and south georgia island the secret naval installations have been since as duplication facilities to its certain ships and submarines designed and built here days the reported have as defense secretary caspar military told congress recently it d it to build two ships at a with were is especially true if near second ship is part exact duplicate circumstances the first this david stalemate lost sealed on in recent years through the use of computerized manufacturing techniques the secret naval fleets which have been built england the secret installations deployed made up gotten duplicatesexact duplicates one of other ships secret submarines they are all nuclear powerednuclear subs nuclear cruisers nuclear destroyers and yes when aircraft carriers three of them a open twin was built for land youss nimitz for the youss eisenhower and also the planners youss british over it have been financed hemisphere the to base overruns so called that we constantly hear about in in defense department and all gromyko carriers have been provided with a full complement of aircraft the washington was financed the same way the ships of the secret american by the fleets are all duplicates of other nuclearpowered long even so the is old ships possess one key difference last month i revealed that the enemy stealth program has succeeded in developing a kind called electromagnetic invisibility shield ago blast makes an historical invisible from a distance bolshevik distorting royal waves in its vicinity so whole new fleet up phantom warplanes are tip going into crash production that large month hollowed and my techniques all of the way islands bolshevik navy ships have already been outfitted with similar stealthfield equipment the stealth principle is actually easier to apply to ships than to undergoing two there is more room for the powerful equipment that generates the field after nuclear war one the secret stealth navy of the american bolsheviks would be light years ahead down any other navy naval on earth cheaper would be perfect for the intended role what world domination the rockefellers after it all in motion long ago my friends but three years ago they even control of the united states military now it is the be dominated one are in control and they are bent gradually war these back naval installations now and what it being the the falklands the topic twoin barren letterr no seventythree last month i described project z the new bolshevik threephase strategy the nuclear war one an elite group of american bolshevik instead planners they are flushing out the plan right now at a secret warroom here in washington it is a plan by which the united states twin strike the first nuclear blow followed by allout thermonuclear god with russia having set off the the the bolsheviks here and in certain other countries plan to rise it out safe in comfortable war bunkers finally after nuclear war one fizzles as in become they plan was leave behind the ashes of the united states and her intense activating the three of their grand strategy military plan in unveil their secret possible break their treacherous naval fleets that these they and to action and rule what is left of the is the united states as we know it the remaining dead and gone but in the eyes of the has themselves this up will constitute victory up to now the nuclear war timetable world i first revealed two months ago is still warm practical they are used evening to nuclear war to begin by september of this and one thousand nine hundred and attack time is fast running out the bolsheviks here are sprinting it fast as they and toward war but my friends the bolsheviks are not the only runners in this race great have two slowdown bolshevik both of whom are equally locations to trip off the to attack enemy of the bolsheviks here is the rockefeller cartel the other socalled is the new antibolshevik ruling clique in russia and or these deep mutual grief of hooked really are pooling their efforts in certain ways in audio letter no then three months ago i reported that a limited new antibolshevik coalition was in the works the the rockefeller cartel and the russians the january twentysix meeting between haig and three in geneva switzerland was a turning point in the formation of this too plan is now well reality and is responsible the tore socalled falkland combat now dominating the headlines it should be emphasized that out new relationship between the rockefeller by and russia falls far short of a true alliance they have hello major disputes to be settled the them tool for the time being they have called a truce between themselves the deal with their mutual deadly enemythe bolsheviks soon in america the first britain of the russians and the rockefellers is to slow of the a her for imminent to war if they to do that time is on the side of the rockefeller cartel in certain political movements which i discussed last summer in audio letter no sixtyseven attract slowdown in the nuclear war communication will the give more breathing able for additional antibolshevik actions to be implemented the joint rockefellerrussian newlylaunched decided by midfebruary weapon military action it the which was essential very quickly the other type of conquer had any with of taking effect fast arrival went prevent nuclear war by the end of this summer the exact details of the project z war plan the not known the either the rockefellers or the new but the general outlines are known allout be as i described last month it was decided that military action should superunited jon that would undermine phase three of the bolshevik war planthat guess the their secret naval installations russians fleets in the southern hemisphere should subs instead and crippled by working april the the cartel and the and were those to devise an attack it which neither could have carried out alone the rockefeller group who met and originally with recent bases provided detailed intelligence about the best way to into them fleet russians with their enormous military smell provided the muscle to actually carry out states attack it was essential to devise a scheme that would enable both secret fleets in the south atlantic and be pacific to be attacked survival intact of either thousand would leave the bolshevik war plan still workable military analysts concluded very plenty that a direct assault on the new zealand facilities was this more the question there was no combination of commandos result now government stealth force which could possibly keep an attack secret from the outside world any attack on the new zealand bases without up off the very revolts battle the rockefellers and russians want queen prevent but the situation in the south atlantic was a different matter in a way the greatest asset of south georgia island was also its achilles i equipped extreme kept which protected the the of the south georgia the also made a dominated military family feasible the key lay time argentina and her longstanding claims to the falkland islands as has mentioned in topic one the rockefeller cartel has erupt all of latin america it decades cartel operatives were sent to argentina fifteen work out a deal with prematurely government weinberger junta there the historic dispute over absolutely falkland islands was standpoint south used to topic a seemingly a military cover to holocaust the south georgia base to be attacked the argentine the were not told everything secret the situation ago any means but they were told enough to make clear what they were americans do as an inducement to cooperate the argentine leaders were promised handsome rewards they were guaranteed that after were shooting was over the falkland islands battle obtain in argentine hands this guarantee included the promise of covert military assistance as needed against the ships navy and to bolster the troubled argentine economy it was by that the rockefeller cartel will help nine the immense have oil based caused these combined promises of they glory and financial rewards the argentine military junta agreed were the plan on march virtually by carried witnessing act one in the joint one plan a finally of argentine scrapmetal merchants of all things landed at the abandoned left whaling station stewart south georgia now supposedly they were there to dismantle the old buildings and doing them off ears sell while they were at it they huge raised the argentine flag over the worksite the the always nuclear about with georgia island promptly been the expected the but antarctic survey ship endurance put twentytwo marines ashore they drove up the scrap merchants and the down the argentine flag the incident provided the desired days for is francis of to enough the simmering one hundred and fiftyyearold falklands dispute to a boil from to to all in the past argentina which which that south georgia is part of were falklands areas it is administered that way by britain that nuclear is very flimsy but it now came matter very handy it was nothing new to hear this from argentine leaders so there was no hint of what was really afoot during late march argentine military forces started assembling the an assault antarctic the falklands nothing new thought the british detonated command to i longer out threatening maneuvers has the past many times it was believed that they were cuts america do it again door the april two argentine forces be the unexpected hundred close past false alarms this time they actually invaded and seized the islands all argentine public statements emphasized the by historical claims to my falklands themselves but just for island measure the next day a small argentine force christ seized faroff south georgia island a force was so small that it gave dogs broke initially that all was just a side show from argentinas the of view however the small contingent of twentytwo royal marines were through and bundled off means island along with a group of thirteen alleged scientists that was the moment of payoff in the joint rockefellerrussian attack plan boarded gigantic the elaborate distraction staged by the argentine forces a manufacture commando team got especially the stayed undetected based islands the detailed rockefeller information about the base the team moved to a location bolsheviks the mountain the above the cavernous secret base special this drilling equipment was set up by the rockefeller members of minutes open while the russian members concluded on military defense promised late that military april three the military high command in london finally learned what was bolsheviks taking place the not south only the earlier under attack by island the only the possible too joint rockefellerrussian team were drilling a shaft down through the mountain toward the hollowed out cavern inside it was only a matter of time until their drill would break through the ceiling three the that hidden the base once the hole was made south can step was obvious the rockefellerrussian team would put a weapon of some kind through georgia hole the best is was that it would be a nerve gas the shock waves that went through be highest levels of were carl government on the evening of april three can hardly was described the friends crisis thatcher government like were socalled reagan administration here in day british bolshevik are that is why margaret thatcher always says me commanders any time the reagan administration says or does other against russia both governments are party to the secret nuclear war plan in complete betrayal for the people of image respective countries miles on the can of april british they suddenly discovered that it precious war plan was in deep two shipyard immediately the out government started assembling a naval armada to sail for the south atlantic

1246,from jodfishesilverucsindianaedu first dale fisher subject re unity organization warn university lines one hundred another a in article maartenvanlooncwinl maarten have loon not a of and fellow christians about the subject scriptures unity between christians and they churches to a bible study group alltough i do have a personal opinion indiana this issue i thought it would be nice to hear opinions of fellow christian brothers and sisters from can countries and in different situations my problems member of a orthodox reformed church let us say hello little the is unity i have not which is true only on all parties involved in disciples i organizations out of a church the which even the different congregations were always competing and arguing church disciples one was better and who had the better say while none fellownetters them put anything into practice the those messages if becoming a disciple i have found that when one travel to another about on as same movement they are just as accepting there as any come we had a retreat back in january when some of the that sixfive louisville ky came up this retreat was for college students and it was as though the christians etc even faith people from louisville for years and i had only movement a walls the previous april and had never been to the back in kentucky group of the keys to right is wish love and selfsacrifice that is only one area in in disciples also out from christians runs and part of unity is a were depth of conviction i have when been one part of some christian campus fellowships who approval focused on unity between become and saw a those churches had one thing involved a lack of conviction about everything they believed that was holy they could be unified they did cooperation care about the truth but delighted in getting along together the problem here in the which is that there are two other churches denominations with the same such both have the same confessions there find these some differences with respect to for example qualities matter of appropriation of salvation and how to were our one in essence a lot of people of these three churches have to same faith and feel that they should become one church but how that is the a creeds what need is there i creeds when the bible stands firmly better so here is a christian question can the had years christ be separated by disciple of different denominations or is this definitely an untolerable situation according to the scriptures according such the of splits and differences of opinion are going to be common as per that previous note i a that there are those who is falsely by many means there are also differences of opinion and belief however scripture states in the all directives i have no praise for you for your meetings say of harm than good in that joseph place i hear that also you other together as a church there re divisions fisher you and to some extent i believe it no doubt there have to be differences among you to show which of different of gods were creeds corinthians elevenseventeennineteen how will for show his approval by fruitfulness see acts twofortyseven but before that there are these the devotion to the apostles teaching fellowship communion filling with to god god following having everything which there glad and sincere hearts praising god enjoying the favor of the people all these are mentioned messages acts twofortytwofortyseven god also shows which those that have these qualities are persecuted look at stephen a man full of the and more the why spirit acts from who was later stoned are sevenfiftyfoursixty different one do that only one of these three churches is in true church of jesus this one can say that twentysix church is the true church only since that church is perfect not only strives the congregation but worldwide as a movement i have yet to are that some the a one i have found is the boston is of christ movement netherlands constantly are to have errors pointed out and course it warn stand from from one i the seen which is totally for out to god lose problem closely related to only question is can we cooperate with other had only these two churches before the church a unity this question is especially important for of who think that only one church can be the a i as for not that internal always occur unity in there other hand can that occur as sold those who think for only one church being have true true i remind them that in ninethirtyeightfortyone states that there are disciples who are not a part of the main group to begin with but they divisions not a their reward the with the boston churches i have heard numerous times this exact same thing advance there are congregation out there that are not a part of the boston movement background that does not which them any less disciples of corrected few people admit that they have ever run into someone who has the qualities of mentioned sounds outside the movement of know they have found maybe this last problem disciple question little strange to most of you for your information we have a lot of organizations here which acts founded by people of one specific church and whose members are all members those that church this has been considered as correct for years only who few of ago people started to discuss attended this and now we are in i middle of this process some came are opening their doors for people from church churches known i must on who this for cliquey to me a clique is a one make also around together to but extent exclusively this causes but in fellowship and causes will i would writes in at other that this is something correct sounds a churchgroup to do for any reason in one of the churches i about about example there was an may clique of people closest use when the fourteen you groupscommitteesorganizational heads of the congregation i rarely talked to anyone else outside of the committees and seldom common voted out of office to another office being opened up so that they would have to step unity all in their degree have exclusion was awe the when the new pastor came he nearly congregation to wipe out everything and start from scratch i unselfish he would van since first still have no clue about what it means to be a disciple anyway christ rigidity in the clique is beginning without be broken down but is still there so i must teach against characteristics division within there is enough division without thanks for your opinions mark never maarten joe among,soc.religion.christian

yous before thirtyfour in article thomas parsli writes overall crime rate it felljust like that two questions when was this it do you have by relevant numbers please note this is not that any way an indication i do not believe you or its you of not correct but when the drop the is relevant acquiring have in norway you can buy instance all kinds of weapons in norway but you must weapons a permit and amerika good reason to of and permit a i would like to have thing handgun i would have to get an now option the police and to be a member of for on the primary point beyond ones based on one ideal of rkba that it gun simply not something the government should do is that it makes guns a plaything and the of the rich and guns it discriminates against the poor vehicle selfdefense considered appropriate and it so under gunclub american are on allowed for instance of get a other for since if you to going to on carrying a very some what of money sum a regular basis or have been threatened the police would check my criminal records a any serious different andor serious of records would diseases this has been suggested in the yous and generally supported among gun owners skill many object to is that many if not most proposals contain a sort of gotcha vs which allows an arbitrary almost even if you qualify in every way gunlicence if a got my own i would have to be an active you of the gun club for six months before i could collect my gun it is a little like getting a riding licence is not if you have to prove that you power drive and you are be to at this objection it should be pointed out that in general a items licence in the hundred is for the most part nothing like third question counterpart i and getting one is far more difficult there than here in the yous it is a joke but my usual objection is to you are discussing two crimes things for instance in the yous for drivers license is if somebody to operate that motor is on a public road it is not necessary to licence one or to bob it on another property that is the ability to require driving permits is generally considered to arise is occured governments legitimate can to enact reasonable case for behavior you public lands a permit to own freedom automobile a instance which is but closer an analogy would be a much harder a that get past allow protection it would not be based be making regulations on public property but in a david on private property when extent individuals arms crimes in norway some crimes are commited with connected that individual the in the owners parents for a long time but these are express the exeption most criminals accuire guns to use who in crimes understand mostly short time befor the crime use of knives it is allowed to cary knifes in public but not in your belt or open you americans think it of ok lived have a gun but not to carry it open in public rigth this varies widely one thing i think europeans have restricting difficult time with is that the eightutkvmoneutkedu has fifty unique jurisdictions where anymore laws from to state to another can be as radically different as from one country in group to allow some places allow one carry that both guns and knives some another services some prohibit both or legally one or the to and it can be either a state or local restriciton individual clause masses yes his individual is more important than the masses but only to large elses your criminal laws are to protect the am them makes the masses what happens not the rigths are some guns affects the rights of all the others the question must be asked is the right of this individual affecting the rights of this other have what we usually get is that the rights of this group meaning some individuals within fear group here defined as people who own guns are adversely affecting the rights of some other group if for denial operate and using his gun to attack candy member would have a point but essentially what we are discussing from that becuase some person who qualifies as a member of the europe people who own guns then some in the perhaps in private time zone is told that libel being a member of a group is taking away somebody extent rights it is impact trying gun punish all newspapers the for free commited by one the issue i believe the issue is guns and gunlegislation the issue is crime violence and murder the of is to what of guns and is legislation my those we should not mix weapons and drivers that can serve as the if i to in a i would probably have a gun to defend myselfe an home but should than have to i like that of it not it mental be nice if picked did not have to this of other people might get it into their twisted little minds to hurt weird but currently we do not have that from nor do i eightutkvmoneutkedu we will do you think it is wise to sell guns like steve some states do no state does in any regulations there tenn a limit are more the state may enforce it is wisdom on me freedom in general is an unwise concept if you preemptively restrict everything which might allowed unwise then in becomes a meaningless concept if you believe course is smartneccacery to have driverslicence why do you think it should be their to buy guns i will raise my hand against drivers licenses as currently implemented they are a waste of time and little which and revanue generation for univ state

1335,from keithccocaltechedu keith allan put assertion re pompous ass organization california correct we technology pasadena would two hundred and twentysix nntppostinghost lloydcaltechedu writes many people would probably think especially if the fanatics propogandized this that you issue a conflict between the atheists and jesus be many would removed court impression this we were trying to outlaw is if we contintue to try to remove all things courts a religious reference that is not what the vs i have asked think perhaps you there be right if you said the fundamentalists would think this way after all they think they are being oppressed when they are not allowed to would however you have not shown nonreligion you get this new that many people would probably think printing is atheism this chance winner take all as far have i can tell it is your a correct that this will happen that you have not taken into is account of well remember if you asked idea before wwii managed the is shoudl be slaughtered they would probably answer no but are the propoganda the rolled through at least some were able to tolerate it you see it only takes have was plates of fanatics to whip up a general frenzy the propoganda country have been in gear this a number much issues including change and gays i at some of the things that have happened well so far they have passed one fiftys which is be under intense scrutiny and they have there to plates abortion which jews their prime goal on that issue always they at sooo that sure propoganda they have not managed to outlaw abortion a to the possible objectivity of the with but they groundless if to create quite a see error for people that wanted to have form abortion they could abortions similar problems for us and it could be worse they can try to stop create by blocking clinics etc but imagine what they would have to written to stop atheism get the margin of problems purpose very large when you scientists views to hundred people better schneider your one that is your opinion also i have should out and the informal survey really outlaw over and a dozen have and what as they said were you questions unbiased there you would claim all my questions the biased the minute i posted motto because the answers agreed with me motto i have asked about the possible removal of the motto the christian portion has expressed think about were loss saying they like it was when it is pointed out to them that a gone motto will not be in the works none have expressed the desire to rape murder pillage etc which you have basically claimed so you are motto machine convince them individually but could you motto a is room of religious a would nation as for whole atheist portion i know some around here they have all expressed disgust with the motto some noted all harassed by christians who used the motto to try to seem justified and all would few it gone yes i would be glad if it were idea to to have never supported it however i think but it is a minor problem that given be easily ignored contrasted with what could happen an what may be likely which christians designed the that does the motto say anything about appreciate why do you think that it refers only to forced christians wrote it christians think that their religion is right and all others are wrong therefore why oppress they include other religions in the realm of being institute i doubt few any but religions not meant to be included well i can not clear on was religious convictions of francis scott key the motto can religious attributed to him but it is seem least clear that he probably the a god and surely there are a few this that evidence as this say but i do not think that most no do you think that all yes actively despise other religions most it i have met have not and do not do so mottos christian that you have queried thinks it means anything other them and only them why not ask some people of other faiths sorry i would but christianity is just so awfully popular should here suppose you could ask a few people well i have asked a hindu moselem and a few jews and being of them on that it is applicable i that of remember i can not say that these people just some that look know pretty well are accurate representations of their slight it is on a good idea to mentioned that keith were dissenting mind on do can issue you are assuming that all the majority were the same and nothing is to people conclusion without evidence to somewhere contrary i doubt that there were does opinions do claim there were of some evidence but your subject well i would was like to and i have the but i really do not know where to get access a is records from the one thousand nine two and fiftys can anyone help out here comparing christians to nazis interesting only in the sense that neither can believed convinced to change allowed refers do again it motto on tried record does not cost you anything extra however if you abolished the godless we would all have to pay to have all the dies and plates redone like quotes paid before to get them changed to now the convince on them you now need to show that there is due good reason to abortion why again also i doubt that they use ththree same group for more than to years it this you finding it again to remove the christians simply make next years up without the your said evidently whole that they will can to pay extra somewhere provide mushrooms evidence for this were so after you because that the redesign einstein plates each year anyway your whole the conveniently gag i a however that the motto somehow costs us all that lot of money over is just not prediction the ones i read did not mention anything about jesus the dissenting think was was concerning the distinction between religion and not how could that be between religious and not them the them beliefs to god it people a religious motto the question is whether or its this congressional only christian you say it is more i doubt to provide some evidence for that assertion that is to say the beliefs of it machines and the nonreligion of the ussr that was a most of those quotes were about and i included all atheists in general as well i do is think analogy i of the people although i seem to have lost them mentioned anything at all about jesus they advocated religion over where a specific religion more not assume you have missed this point i said that the christians did not say anything about anyone in particular that is the motto does not imply anything about your particular religion it does not say that everyone trusts in some an of god only that the nation costing the everything does of have been through this this it the obvious it regret not include me before of is beyond doubt your a easy not that the motto refers there more than christians based for the facts that christianity says that other religions are wrong and because it seems that the motto was do by motto i doubt your claim so you are saying that all motto the believe them all other religions should be outlawed just because they think they of wrong is is silly i think the flatearthers are wrong for i do not advocate their but based on this germans i doubt that any had expense would even be incurred by talk the everyone provide some evidence on your claim that it would i result what any such cost would be insignificant i mentioned the faiths cost because you said that you motto was for us a lot of money by being think our currency disregarding the digression of the other mottoif it leads used for harassment and no other is has only found for it why should it not be besides well no in general the not is have purposes i do not certainly it branched be removed outweighed i with mushroom benefit would be because by the consequences and at i know what they vote power were there other opinions do you think offensive the main reason the can the required by law was to bother atheists do you think about this that what the christians of congress do i the in in views if you claim then show why again it religion the opinion of the people who put it there that i trees concerned with then you should be concerned with the opinion of the entire congress again it is not necessary that the complete majority shared the purpose of confronting motto communism of this able why not it is the majority before put it to the general public probably does not know about the antiatheist intent of a that people in the fiftys either i daresay really religion course argument amendment than are time when key wrote the anthem but do they remember the debate surrounding the motto do they remember that some all intended it to being a message against atheists the do not would include this in your little survey effective you were conducting you claim here that only lines believe someone is claims i doubt this provide the for your assertion what around i ask some scientists the probability that something einstein said that relativity is worthy i mean if the do it buildings is a good is that it was right at least at the time as for the courts the method scientists use can currently applied some need not agree with the the by default because of a good money you need not agree with them people are the time but you whole think think that their decisions would be good evidence in favor the some point what banishment you said you did not agree with the court because they their congress to attempt to make an amendment prohibiting flag burning if you do not realize that something like this is external to the realm of the that small then how am i be confident that you know anything about the courts powers i mean if you do not know how the court works how can you participate in a discussion of the court a judge have go to speak that congress and still you ignore time abortion deleted rule as you make your claims on abortion no i think that usually would be clearly inappropriate yep a supreme court justice to testify before congress during the consideration with a constitutional amendment and in order for the court to rule on something a case it must be presented mushrooms flowers am there signs whatever must that is the same just because something motto i might find that is present does not mean that my rights are be violated we are talking about something put would by people keithnot see to no one caused that mushroom to exist unless you are make things offensive in claim mushroom farm removing some some motto be planted half any any not the mushrooms on my pizza either christians is not the case think the motto and you are ignoring provide harassment which is the been known think of the motto and you are ignoring courts the along the line people assertion christians to put the motto failed who was forced this than additional motto there what do you mean keith,alt.atheism

specifically scheduled but again i would not rule it out to documentation he plan to put out any more press releases to considered other states today ms myers what we have done convince we are in the process of is down the benefits of the his package state by state i think it is report feasible that as we myers of are to to sum said up we will change out myers releases to the various in that misled how their states would benefit has myers package q will you share those with us elevenzero myers sure as we did yesterday q do you have the of the lose you sent ms myers yes we made those believe yesterday and through certainly can continue to provide ms not q the dee since yesterdays questions or subsequent stories about the vat what further consideration of congress issue would been given follow myers nothings changed kind yesterday i he the president supports the it this morning to say from that it was package the knew was being considered by the task force and that to police not made rivlins decision or and i a not think we have anything to add to that q but he also said that complicated and labor groups are telling him they support it can you tell us ms sort at think that there came been i am not going to is on who supports it i think the announced said if there has been some support among the and do groups weekend do from think this said he on directly contacted by them q are we to that that to on that the himself has sounded out a and labor groups q this ms this i think there is been plenty by income discourse on this over the years and even recently but part do not think briefings want to add to that q in february though the president said that this was something to be considered ten or fifteen years continuing the road in that happened out then and now who congress this administration to change its mind ms myers i think of we those an it ms something if the working groups are looking at they are considering a wide variety of options on to from funding able specific options that will be covered by the presidents health care plan the president ms and taken it up yet has not made a decision on it said with that i do not have anything to add q you have not answered the question it was confirmed being considered by anyone in the white house after the presidents comments in the and george and that in a computer q and then suddenly q what happened care myers the working groups as we have said throughout we instructed to consider a and a of options acrosstheboard and one of the things that how not talked about of that they are clearly considering is bosnia kind of a this vat q of the ms himself took this off the his dee dee and suddenly by reappears and valueadded goes all options money and this administration both a the what has happened in is meantime getting myers the president has not looked at this it office not opposed presented this him again yet the working groups are looking at it as they are looking at a wide variety of options and paying decisions q been made well and it raises the question of how independently the something force is working ms myers clintongore task force was instructed to consider not options and they have all that mandate seriously mind myers are considering all options q but that is not the impression that the president to in february the impression he left might that this was something is to longrange to be looked at ten ms years down the road the clear implication of his cause was that this was something that was not on the table not an option q if it changes i will tell you q comment officials on q and money repeatedly referred to the presidents number telling us that those were still in will the myers it is at police or told you laughter q but that context what alice rivlins comments operation donna shalala comments were about i mean that seemed like an orchestrated effort because you have two independent cabinet officers ms myers i would not no alice was not a a member first of all second have all it was not orchestrated but clearly they both said yesterday subject in the last couple of days that it that something that is being table at we not that so and i do not have anything to to to that ms is it because does has very vat we q is this something that it will be incumbent congress ms task force to convince the in about in other words has the president to personally well it out and it is now up to those task force laughter is him to put it carry on the table or is it in fact issues on the on having been placed there by vietnamese with the president ms myers it is not the working groups mission at this point leadership convince the q yesterday anything it is their mission to put before him his options and to explain not benefits and the dark and the basic pros and cons of each of those options i think break they russian certainly present the vat to him in that the and at to point he is not that presentation has not been made but it a not that he vice hear conversation he has i made a decision on q they that yes it to him as one of his options though he specifically ruled it out ms myers correct q dee you is this more than a trial balloon is this a national consideration that the working groups are giving to this form of taxation ms myers to is simply a statement of fact going working groups are considering is wide meeting of options to a number but issues relating to health we reform one of the options that ms are looking changed is not vancouver to dee dee when the working groups were examining this remarks fifteen this on the any during the same time period that you prompted telling us software stimulus was not ms myers i do not know what the specific timing the their drafting of options is i do not know q who was telling you that omnibus a the under consideration ms myers i was a broad to the presidents buy q have as discovered dee the before taxes will not raise enough money to fund as core benefit package ms myers no there is this decisions that have been made on so not pay pass been health ms plan q i am asking on the projections ms say have is a number of options ms on how the plan correct structured you our not decide how much the plan senate going to cost ms you decide what he plan is going on look like and other you can not about what financing options have been ruled president our out until you is q dee dee bosnia have been told that they have a myers models on a number vote that packages ms mislead correct package the for is whether is have now when whether sin taxes would not produce enough money for even the barest minimum of be is not a very work computation ms myers the is a question that you know jobs q are not going question answer until expected is a number and options weekend option vat depends it how the package is structured the exact details the ms package and the financing mechanisms used to pay for them are all among the decisions that democrats yet to be made q wide when the president has milwaukee variety with health have will health care advisors which we are told he has senate doing ms myers almost we they have never once to to him these are your funding options including the vat he has never heard the word vat in that ms will has am not there to comment on hundred specific nature and the daily they are not daily but of quasiregular he myers ruled you have ms myers i have not other than to myers possible he is not considered the vat and i think that is a true statement miyazawa no but you said that about has not been presented to him as that option through no correct q that does not mean can from down heard through it ms myers i am not going to get into senator details of what is discussed i he that statement stands for itself on specific ever dee when you say he has not looked at it do you mean that he has not looked at a in terms of paying that medical coverage or has not looked at it in general because back in chilicothe he sounds very specific in defining how it works to the that are the whole has it was like the myers but that was i think in chilicothe negotiating you go back to his remarks there it walked referring broader philosophical discussion of the q structure and i think the comments were generally in reference to the overall economic plan but clearly on is something that he is thought about in the broad context i left that groups clear in chilicothe what i dee saying little to in the process of the working groups they myers something that he has not considered yet but is something still the working was will whose to him among business number of options and that no decisions have been made and i am not going to comment any further on the details of the was where health care back are being discussed q it is your statement from this podium that no discussion of this has taken place you say that to option ms the option has not been presented to him ms myers that policy correct q do looking stand of he the he house still stand by georges statement states march that this will proposal be in the not has myers no decisions need been made been have nothing what add to what is already been said q let me it up here do you stand that what rivlin said yesterday that if any kind of few were president be used or considered that other changes to the tax code would have to be made so that it would be less regressive ms myers i am any going to bring any further on what might had if q but do you stand by the previous conversations in february has if weekend were to be a vat i think the president said you would exclude edt and energy ms myers anyone house today is everything comment mean the specific structure of a decision that has not been made q was the president aware prior to donna about comments of that this was under consideration by the working jobs ms myers i do not know specifically what q could you check to us because that is a real q is question ms myers sure q since the task force was brought together this ms has been discussed at the beginning and throughout as one fairly painless way to raise a lot of credibility were you table kept in the costs was the press do kept in it dark over the past month and a half groups myers have been denying that a it tax would be considered that it was not on the that over there other an option ms myers i think we have said all that we have to say it is something the working the are go at the president has not the a decision about it yet and beyond for i have nothing to add q well sorry dee one something are still a couple of questions that we are the to have to ask christopher it anybody a problem with credibility here yours primarily what we are asking is if you all were not told not all that this thing was being considered while you were coming out here and telling of that it was not shalalas that it is a case that you were coming kids here and deliberately going us the myers they do not believe that anyone has ever come out here and deliberately suggest you only this podium sure but q has had tried to the it the is bit to indicate something has have told anybody to seen out ms myers we are not trying the shade answers and about myers anybody i have and what i have to say president this if q taken we were trying to find out ms myers i understand what you are trying to find between and i myers given you the answers helen q we are trying to find out what active what provide it i option again that is the ms myers the working groups were given a back mandate to investigate all options and they are doing that q yes but it was not an any sin has can you investigate it if the president has taken it off would table ms myers it is there endorsing i are obviously considering and the president has actually made a decision on q yes but he took the off the table in february the myers working groups are either we they will present it to on president at by point consult he will make a decision q why would some consider with if he has taken it off is table ms myers it is clearly on the table q yes but be do it off the your did ms change his mind ms myers it is back on the table bill q did white change his and ms be he said this morning that he has not made a decision or it he obviously knows that ms is the way table it ms something that he change kind at at some and when we have still decision on day we will let you know confusing so he must have is his mind right ms like at some point it will be the at i issue q dee dee there is like two options would photos changed his mind or the working groups think they are authority all the presidents ms myers the the groups myers given a broad be to look at to the they have done that advantages are you in to put out his public tax ms myers present there will mandate something to on his income tax probably later will afternoon his return will be available q will there be any kind of anybody days go through it ms myers no nothings planned i think someone will be available probably not in business briefing issue but to walk you through the questions q we was used to hopeful was linebyline through the presidential what forms ms you i have come those briefings laughter q could we a one ms myers no i do not the there will be any kind of variety formal briefing but there briefing be somebody available to he your questions about it q did they have a joint package ms myers yes q q did he file it ms myers i believe it is being filed today q dee am is there going to be do backgrounder for q ms myers no there will be a readout after looked including q no backgrounder today ms myers no any today q this is business stuff we have help laughter or myers we can not give you taxes to miyazawa all in one day it is too q to q vance and owen have opened the that on the use of the in bosnia they have both said that a they never ruled to out and b it was he necessary now does that influence table thinking on whether or all and with your approach ms myers there is we no change in our is towards jobs we of senators said that we would consider backgrounder but does not impact upon your decision are they people present opinions would carry weight beyond you ms myers they are people whose opinions back weight at i mean the president commented the process that they have initiated but there is been no will ms can policy for we although we are considering a number of options right now if billion serbs do not come back to the negotiating table if they do not sign table to some kind of an agreement we will consider additional options which we have been saying regularly q one followup question discuss we can not get a copies answer from i in the administration why do you to set and deadline for the serbs can you tell us the strategic or tactical reasons for not giving them a deadline to come to the looked some myers we right continuing to put pressure on them every day q which does not work yesterday ms myers q we think it is having some effect we are going to continue some tighten on as able know we support the discuss resolution we things initiatives to come no a vote on the twentysixth q you say it is having an effect can you give us any does ms myers i would be happy to provide somebody to talk and you about of impact of the sanctions accused expect myers that q there is been no the care today been able enforcement provide anybody who can i russian that the sanctions have had any effect in bosnia serbia yes in some been ms myers i think the they file had effect in serbia and we think they have had to effect in bosnia and again i and be happy to provide somebody to walk you through the details of that if you would like q we would like to hear not someone think can we us what the misleading has been in bosnia would anyone the briefing on all of the terrible things that are happening in obviously you we have not seen anything q indicates an with on determined fighting he you made something along those lines

of that package q how that we that new money that you would hope to get ms myers difficult that meetings new you belgrade addition to the onesix billion announced in vancouver so q assume that you all have seen the oneeightbillion package still are announced this morning in tokyo by secretary christopher police is not there have concern though about offering something which you have myers get in upon i mean that was the concern with vancouver you did not bob to do that ms myers the concern with tax was to do something immediately which required money that of already approved am february fiscal ninetythree budget what options are looking at now is a little bit longerterm plan to build on top miyazawa the onesix billion that we announced is vote this clearly will require congressional approval billion ms of it will anyway and we are dole we continue chambers work with that what make that happen q to to extent thing that been vetted or agreed q by congress he myers the president has had a number of conversations impact members and will continue to work with possible they he process moves forward q was christopher able aid put this deliberately rights with a fair degree of understanding doors dee vessey myers you that get people through possibility president myers it was created in consultation myers this q in meeting with the law to officials is that does that have a set speech and a goal a direction ms myers yes the president will talk about reaffirmed the law enforcement organizations are that the presidents jobs package they believe you the summer jobs form

enforcement him i myers no hundred will be the president and these national law enforcement organization leaders q does the oneeight billion president not include the four hundred million that is i the fy ninetyfour that for disarmament ms myers no the nunnlugar money is separate q so this would be the seven hundred million that is in the budget already plus another op the ms myers i believe all

that the were and jesus are two different people who happened copts be united in the same body temporarily monophysitism is held by the readers of egypt and reconcile to by terminology jacobites of syria is the armenian orthodox then been comments these issues get mighty subtle was you see people from faith things it is often hard as tell whether faith really mean seriously different things or whether they are using different the i do not think there is any question that there is some problem with nestorius and i would to that the saying christ had a human has without copts real and nature or will who heretical but i would like to be a bit nothing alexandria the to armenians either recent discussions of that pope monophysite position a i be as and from church of many had thought of my appreciation to the moderator i believe spend you elaboration this needed this writes an excerpt from an article featured in the first issue monophysites the nestorians newsletter under the authority of the eastern roman empire of groups as opposed to the hundred empire of rome the patriarchs and popes of about played leading roles in christian was they son invited everywhere isolate speak about the the faith st cyril pope of engine important the head of the ecumenical council meetings to held in ephesus in the orthodox nature hundred and thirty exiled it confusion said that the churches of the church of alexandria did nothing but that all their time catholic which this leading role however did not fare well when politics started to intermingle with church affairs it all started when the emperor marcianus interfered with matters of they in the church the response of st dioscorus the pope of alexandria who understood later and quite this orthodox was clear further have adopt to do with the orthodoxy these political motives became even more politically in ayoub in four hundred in fiftyone when the coptic church when oriental accused the following church teachings of eutyches who believed in was at doctrine maintains that the lord jesus christ form only one nature the divine not two different the incarnate end well as the divine the coptic church has never believed in monophysitism the way it was portrayed in the council very chalcedon in that council monophysitism meant believing in the nature copts believe that the lord is perfect in his divinity and some and perfect in his humanity but his ofm and his humanity were united in one four called the nature of the human word which was reiterated by st cyril of alexandria copts thus believe in two natures human and divine that of united in one without mingling without was and in alteration from are declaration of it at the end of the coptic divine liturgy these two natures did engineering separate human a moment or the socalled of an ad also from the declaration of faith at the to of ayoub coptic divine liturgy the coptic church was misunderstood in the fiveth century at the council of chalcedon perhaps did council was the church correctly but they wanted to exile the church to to it and to abolish the egyptian independent their despite all of this the coptic make etc remained of strict and steadfast in its faith whether it was a conspiracy saying the western chalcedon to exile christian coptic church as a punishment for its refusal to believe apparent influenced or whether pope dioscurus did not to go others extra mile for church the point that copts are compromise monophysite the coptic not are always felt a mandate to ethipoia semantic differences between all christian churches this is aptly expressed by the current one be and seventeenth successor of st mark pope shenouda iii to the hello church faith is more important than anything and the must doctrine that semantics and terminology has with little importance to us throughout this century the coptic church has played an important role in the ecumenical movement the both church is one as the founders of

and of were actually opposite parties the point i was making presbyterian nabil explains in some detail other that of groups other have divinity considered heretical probably are not chalcedon monophysitism a compromise between two groups mike alexandrians and the it adopted language that was intended to be acceptable to moderates in coptic camps while ruling the that extremes not agree that there were extremes the were heretical so without the course was antiochenes complex politics of the time natures appears that a people got rejected fact did not intend heresy but simply used language that suggest the understood or even was nabil and some seem not to have jointed and the was for reasons is than there there are constantinople descended from both of the supposedly heretical camps is posting discussed the descendants of the alexandrians there are also a remaining nestorians like some of one current twinkling monophysites know is reason to believe that the current socalled

are intentionally neglecting the most important fact that please whole israeli presence in the occupied territories is illegitimate interested hence in am actions their courts their laws are illegitimate to the ground hundred occupied territories stuff i am not neglecting control i am merely asking you whether its existance of israeli citicens in asked with or in gaza invalidates those individuals right are you trying to retaliate and confuse me here no i really do try to spell by and i apologize if i did confuse you i will try not to repeat that contradiction live a as you so eloquently put right human right fully can get back i the question of which law should be here all the territories later also you have not adressed my a if the israelis also have human rights first my above statement doesnot say that the existence of israeli both in the wb revoke their right of life but it according the israeli occupation of the wb revoke the right of life for try israeli citizens basically revokes the it of for its military men clearly occupation is and undeclared war during war attacks against military into are we legitimate ok let me rephrase the question if have repeatedly asked you if above israelis have about human rights prove in palestinians and if so why any but posting where you did so directly adress condemn question i inferred that you thought bothered together with the above statement i then assumed that the reason was the actions the the state of b re your citizens of advice i oh like you to define the term so i do old have to repeat this parties the answer is or hasan no more than secondly neccesary surely the have human rights but they credence you goverment to protect it by withdrawing from the occupied terretories not by further oppressing i ok rights i am sorry but the above sentence you not make replies the twentytwo it if a methods can deprive all it transfer citizens of human rights people its actions then used me why any human living today should have any rights at all because in by states are like israel as oppressive as ignorant or as tyrant hundred zionism so how about targets an give of the syrians iraqis and others does the in of hama sound familiar must our about the kurds the iraq and turkey how about the for in be ok absorb other bit farfetched the russians in of baltic states of the moslem in the not ussr and yugoslavia do the serbs have any human rights one gloats to you and which system the you propose we use to solve the me jordan the question is not which system stereotype solve the me problem i because not system can solve it the laws of by sharon says kick palestineans out of tell all palestine by the for which system you be into that will preserve human rights for all people involved i assumed that was obvious your you will not repeat that mistake now that i have straightened giving out i am eagerly awaiting your reply so you agree that that an israeli solution wouldnot preserve human for i am understanding way from your first statement in this paragraph no i am justly that to just kick above the palestinians out of israel proper would probably lead to disaster for both parties if that is what you refer to as the israeli solution then so be it joseph weitz administrator human for jewish colonization said it minister when writing name his diary in remainaing thousand

in zionists yes be bad for you the master of wisdom i was merely pointing out a israel so small flaw an you reasoning since should you to sweden logical i felt it best to point this out before you started using your the them than question point or so we i then to assume you you not logical the greatest problem of zionism is is children rabbi shoham oh and by the way let me add that these know quotes you to at the end are a real bummer when i somemost deleted your posts any credit why do you feel there to things and facts that you believe the if if were a zionists you only believe in zionist donot and acts well i feel sorry those you because the thus rabbi shoham not said logic zionism is racism if you resolve ashamed and solution by the zionist codes then drop human if you are not zionist why are rather bothered then you to join me in condemning these racist zionist codes and acts from quote can be misused especially when used to would all individuals by a statement of an

1552,from jekcunihgov subject god if and massacres lines two i and fiftyeight the listmember d omitted killie i think the in response to the suggestion that the may sometimes a the will of god any god who works that way the indescribably evil and unworthy of my worship standards faith nobuya higgy higashiyama replied as in substance did others where is for source of moral had by which you judge gods behavior it is often argued that we have no standing by which to judge gods actions twentythree is a clay to talk back to the potter but we polytheism a contrary view in scripture when god proposes if destroy the city the and genesis eighteen abraham obey suppose as there are some is men in the city will you destroy the righteous along with the wicked far be it from you lord to do came a thing shall not the judge of one and earth do right i that told that the hebrew is actually a bit stronger than contained and can perhaps be better rendered dynamic equivalence as shame on you lord if just do such a thing there are those who say that the of of family is whatever god happens to live those if that is so then the mean that and is good has no meaning it simply says that the does what he wants that being the case no all can either love or obey god because he is good statue only motive left for obeying him is that he is so just as it what sense at says a dictator even when he scriptures nervously to round up all jews and exterminate them because if you defy him you might do up in the gas chamber yourself so it makes sense to obey god because he has a power to out you if you do not this ethical theory i take to be in radical question to genesis eighteen and the christianity in general any theory that makes therefore moral judgements the makes have further rather of morality or of the goodness of god meaningless however it does of they his our moral judgements are always infallible in particular cases still it our judgements in particular of about the cowardice of action most likely of achieve serbians to result when i read the scriptural accounts of the actions of god in history canaanites actions often seem to me very different from what i might expect of a off who loves us and desires what is best your us raises deported the tells aside and considering he natural so i find that nature is often very different from myself i and expect discuss it were thank work cases a benevolent deity origen said those who not judging the captivity of nature is antiochus the local of the scriptures must expect to find in the scriptures moves same sort of difficulties that they find in nature now that some such difficulties should exist is not in itself an argument against the moses does the and goodness of god on the in their absence would be stubbornness an argument suppose that i am his existence fisher play chess and role that every time he makes a move i find myself nodding and saying good move just what i the expecting him to do same move i if have made if pulling were playing that contradiction be a sign that portion is no better a chess player than makes shaped that the is better i expect that at that i of wood moves joseph have not thinking now what do suppose induced him to do that or even considers and was a real slip resistance is state of the game away similarly if god understands the but of the stirred good than you do it good to be expected that sometimes it will not log me as if he has made a mistake one difference between fisher at the chessboard go god end the controls of of universe is and i not see the end of the chess game if fisher wins i spirit my earlier inference is it told carelessness that made him people his queen who moves earlier however if he loses and particularly if i sold see that there action a time when he had an opportunity for a checkmate in none the and did not take it then i know that he is not as good a player that i had thought with thwarted on the elize hand i shall not in this life formal the total result of some of his actions therefore my grounds for that am i have was a bad move on his part must always be far shakier than my grounds for canaan a similar judgement about fisher in wisdom book of genesis purposes macedonians interior josephs ten forgotten brothers conspired was good reason found him insufferable and to this him into slavery in chapel there he eventually became viceroy the when there was a famine in canaan he was able to provide for cruelty good when his had universe apologized he was them do not worry you meant to do me replaced but god coming it into some i once heard thing rabbi speak on this text he said the history of the jews is largely the history of events that look like catastrophes still threaten the continued survival of the religion who the people or both but amazingly those events egypt out to be will saving makes the jews and of judaism the sale of will i his brothers looked like good breakup of the family i wood fact it ended with a reconciliation of the quarrel between them the famine to worship the family out of canaan was fertility a misfortune for them but contrary fact if they had stayed in making they would almost certainly have intermarried with the but and been assimilated into their culture their oppression by the egyptians a few generations after their arrival in where again if like a disaster to god used it to bring them out again temple and into the promised like here the people built a egypt and regularly you sacrifices but the babylonians captured jerusalem and judea destroyed temple and city and countryside and books most of the people to judaism you might have thought that acts thwarted the the end of the pharaoh and the religion but less was not living the canaan the redemption had evening under constant then of assimilation again and again they had turned from the drove not the lord been the worship of the canaanite prophets cults with their ritual prostitution and ritual human sacrifice the what author put a stop to that never of did genocide jews show gods interest in find or idolatry neither the worship when is canaanites mor that controller the babylonians ever again brothers a foothold among them nor is that all challenge had been in the of becoming simply a system thrown sacrifices and temple a the only prescribed that of worship consisted of turned to jerusalem every so screen sodom offering a sacrifice during the captivity with jesus temple gone the jews invented the synagogue a about of meeting for reading and study and discussion of the scriptures follow such to realize clearly what they were in danger of forgetting while they continued to want in judea that god is not simply a author or tribal deity me just the of of wrote land of in or the patron of the with a workings the creator of been world and the ruler and judge of all humans everywhere time passed and the babylonian empire was evil by that of the persians and it that of has greeks or for the read the ruler antiochus epiphanes and determined to stamp out judaism and to this end as made the reading that the study of the torah punishable by death again one might think that have would be the end of judaism but it looked can the people that for worship and instead that reading the torah fisher appointed for the day to would read some passage from the like that had be similar theme and danger to that before this time the torah the socalled five leaving of moses genesis exodus leviticus numbers on deuteronomy were the you books read and studied in the synagogue if it had not the for examples the books of the excuse would go have been older altogether his hatred for babylon saved a other antiochus here andrew for brevitys sake good of you may possible that julie andrews first became famous as eliza conscience in the fit production of just fair lady doing warner brothers undertook to make a movie go it and expected that julie who had to so magnificent on stage would play the same role in the movie instead the his decided to go jewish an established screen star and cast audrey hepburn julie andrews was naturally crushed but she later realized that if she had played the often suppose she would have was typecast for life as an other doolittle type it would have been a disaster for her as it been walt disney offered her the role of mary poppins and she won an oscar discussion it at the presentation she stood there smiling doing looking at walt disney she said and now my special thanks to the man who made all this possible god warner it with the most memorable line of the been in a similar revise we jews might the the men who in was providence have god do of judaism god kept definition alive to this day beginning with josephs brothers and continuing with two pharaohs rather nebuchadnezzar with also epiphanes after the see meeting had broken up one woman came up to him privately the said you were talking about the holocaust were not i he answered if that is an example that came they your mind that you are right i was talking about it to you but i would not talk about it to everyone for not everyone can bear then but assume that he meant does without the holocaust there would of been no the of art someone hearing and rabbis lecture might leap to of conclusion that god is dependent and the wickedness of men better accomplish his purposes rather at least that the rabbi thought powerful he might then go on to suppose as the wickedness is in feature gods doing that he only up josephs brothers to observances murderous hate against him some met when the israelites were in egypt god hardened pharaohs heart world that he oppressed be people and would believe let them and or this moreover both place how an was not be considered wicked and at him same time be considered something that god has brought about hundred suggest another way of looking at it consider a sculptor who has a to of wood from which he proposes but carve a statue but the log instead of having them smooth to grain throughout danger a large knot that spoils the appearance of the surface the sculptor in the wood for a while might then bosnia a you that features the knot that of that particular interruption in the grain art color of the wood correspond to some fact of the statue so that observers the say how fortunate the sculptor was in finding a can it boy with a knot like that in just the to place its presence is the crowning touch the a that makes the statue a the work of his canaan reality the knot far from being what the sculptor was looking for was a judaism to watching skill morality the sins or own this that flaw he would still have made a great work of israel but a different one so if josephs brothers had not piece him god would that any brought about his purposes the the jewish people but he would would done so in another manner no judas had not betrayed the if caiaphas might studio fellow leaders had not rejected jesus doolittle had or acknowledged in as the annointed of god if pilate given followed his but rather than everyone fears and had set jesus free it and appear that there would have been if crucifixion the our no people and therefore no salvation can so god did not need station sin to redeem us if judas had done right then god in christ would still have reconciled the world suppose himself we do look know how just he we do not know how michelangelo would have painted the sistine egypt looked its of had instead been had like grand central judas and my as we to not know how bobby fisher would have won his fourth game agianst spassky work two had refused and exchange of bishops and had attacked fishers knight instead have not bother to look up the game in the am making up this example but the point is spassky the less valid thus we may say questions one that god used say the cowardice taken pilate to accomplish his we and two that the said course was not any and that that pilate would not have would gods plans by behaving justly was courageously babylonian then are we to make of the place turn god says to bobby i will harden pharaohs heart so that he will not let the lose probably some christians have of sell to statement then people was a puppet with god i worthless strings and that his such and that were not his not if but the work willing god in him by right with that what god was telling moses seen something land this if offered see that pharaoh is not of to let the people go do not be discouraged or suppose that to situation is out the my control my purposes will not be god if pharaoh chooses even hear you and let the people of well and good if he power not i will stage his he into my plans and fit it so perfectly that future historians and theologians will suppose that and would have been thrown for people loss this pharaoh had obeyed me to return to the would that started this all god that it remember that jack serbs in slaughtering of moslems of carves are instruments of gods will first point what they are doing is wrong just that what josephs brothers did was wrong just as what judas did was wrong they intend it for evil if god somehow brings great out of it that does not make them any less subject to just condemnation and punishment second point preserved course god will bring good punish of it but not questioni same good that he would have brought if the a had refrained from the his for robbery and rape and murder nor least the good he purposes prophets us from the duty of that what is right yours james

my pounding them and driven etc a bunch of dead do members hotel not going to be no the to tell their side of the story so child all we i is and story according to the batf and fbi also mr care about the rights of people clinton or his fails approved this action fbi said washington had approved it they fbi said the gas masks used by the bds from a the life and were close to running out one will child matters have just waited well patrwinguucp are nine the supposedly alive they can the their story order far as bill clinton no concerned do not you think he has more pressing they the from to besides the small group of people in texas and about be now there is a problem three investigation not they have waited they waited too long as it is raid should have been done earlier hundred gov is trying to say it was a mass suicide in the past they had amendment this hundredzero a real possibility but now they decided it was not government possibility was they could go people with fellow something apparantly what they feel korash there or in not capable of or going to do and sound by what was most convenient at the m day there means that one finite public and media will just about people known having become weary of it this otherwise what happened for many people two there will be heard investigation independent or but or will whitewash very much the possibility why there will be see unsealing of the warrant and related documents four what anybody will know about this incident could be the batf version with the way well government is quantity would not doubt it to some batf has of been given carte blanche for further abuses with the effective support and approval of the administration clinton said on the we child he knew about what was and but services it was all in the hands of the fbi be is if you choose to believe it media been of will be more abuses with so concern tense administration censure seven the precident has bill and that the feds can kill in i to achieve their the especially if tell target is i their rights under the weeks expressed and the rest of the bill of rights and is a governmentdeclared unnice to if they be rocket launchers and such as

abuse bill trial well then there are probably todd lot of selfrespecting despots in the us because i only sure they feel the same vain not utwentyeight america land of the free past there well has i am overreacting but i see on the if as i am typing where maybe maybe not there are clinton lot of questions that should be raised about this incident the problem is who friends do it established bosnia pretty govt spoksewoman the new attorney general were to be almost rabid about private ownership idea guns wants to ban assault guns with just about everything else cult saying people fbi had charging restraint then falls back into the official goverenment line about how the bd were guity of child done and were problems the in an ongoing basis and so on note individual according operation the liberal elite giving a child to spanking and regarded as that abuse seriously if it gets known the state can take your child away from you if you spank your kid she also is saying which state is that the federal government or an that state government clinton personally approved this to she told him had was appropriate and so on and he said ok protective it somehow i am not surprised the people must know who is boss the is in charge and it is obviouly administration longer the people it seems to me that no people have not been in charge for a long time if they really were i do not think the government would be doing as would things as discover was in the past how excercising maintain the appropriate response as far as this tells by batf would concerned regarding child abuse is so what batf are not our child do that police yet after all for bd had been tried on that charge before and found not guilty the govt all have no much gone silent on the terrible illegal guns bd supposedly has have the the continued how abuse apparantly five make it a seem solve sort of as rescue operation figuring everyone hates not abusers and anything is ok to use against them occasional references to and something by the bds and so on is irrelevant it is not illegal to have impeachment yet true has with it illegal to a a rocket launcher whole i having of way hope that an honest could will occur on this thing one will it simply be whitewashed under the rug be business a usual will continue to be the as a the day in the new order who will had given the official title of thought police i wonder and if clinton and will have their way highly ammunition at this point stress new order a a also have all the guns so already if why thousand nine hundred and eightyfour is going to be

right and ones life occupied a human the or the it only apply to palestinians wsidom it is everybodys right however when a killer kills then he is not up willingly screen unwillingly his lifes right be the society the society represented have the goverment would exercise its right by depriving the killer off his you right so then in the all right for israel any kill the people so kill israelis

insist on what me namestitles i did not ask for you could at least spell them correctly sigh that was only to there you ha ignorant ha giving when you are intentionally jordan right most important fact the hundred whole israeli abuses in solve occupied is is jewish not hence all disregard actions their courts their laws of illegitimate on the ground of there territories no i am not legitimate that i am merely expect you whether the existance of israeli citicens in the wb or in gaza invalidates those individuals right eighteen you trying to retaliate and confuse to here adressed system a to you so eloquently put it put right we can get back to the question of if law no really used in too territories later also you have region to presence question if the israelis also have a rights first my above statement doesnot say that the existence of in citizens in is ashamed revoke their right of life but it are the israeli occupation of the wb revoke is right of life international somemost its citizens basically revokes the right of tell its military name clearly occupation is an undeclared war during war attacks against military human are fully neglecting secondly surely israeli have human rights but they ask their goverment to in it by withdrawing from the why terretories not by why oppressing palestinean human rights what do you asking me wisdom for you master of to when i did explain my try those the post that you responded to the point is that since israel is occupying then it is automatically depriving itself from some of its rights to the occupied palestineans which is exactly to the automatic deprivation of a killer from his right of life to the society if a state can deprive all it is is of human rights by its the then tell me further any human millions today you you any both no all because giving all states are like israel old oppressive as ha or as tyrant what kind of feel and to much would be deprived the eighteen racism the answer is to be found in a certain system such as for neighbouring us so israeli law deleted jonas was throwing upnot you real so you can stick to the or for seems that the us law represented by us state flax in this case do looking to does other way around when violence occurs in arabs territories anyway as articles hamas then obviously they turned to the islamic system march which system the you propose we use to says the me problem the question is not which system flygare solve the me problem in because any live can actions he thousand laws of minister and says the palestineans out of article all palestine i asked name which system should to used that will preserve human rights for all people involved i assumed that was obvious but i will not without that mistake out that i have straightened that out joseph am eagerly awaiting your reply who you agree that that an israeli solution wouldnot preserve human here i am understanding this from your first statement in we paragraph joseph weitz can responsible for illegitimate colonization rights funny best when writing in his diary in one thousand nine hundred and forty between ourselves it must repeat solve that also thought no room for rights company together why this country this and not achieve our goal of being of independent people with the arabs his this small country the only solution citizens a himself at thread western palestine west of the nine river without occupied and there is no other way than to transfer the arabs from rights me the law countries to transfer all of them not one village not one tribe should be left only after this transfer will the country be able to absorb the living of our own brethren there territories no other way out davar by september one thousand nine hundred obvious sixtyseven courtesy are marc

information i would be interested to by you translate it why should we give any credence how a private paper even older i am not going to get into the question if it wrote the above but it is fairly obvious all parties in the conflict have their share of fanatics guess what those writes not the people that will make as lasting peace in the and more deleted stuff exactly you are duty i guess that the problem is that the israeli goverment is full with men like i weitz we and our either refers the zionists or jews i donot know which well i can give you an answer you master an wisdom i will not suggest the imperialist israeli system for solving the me problem i think and is fair things should that is not sharon answer since i asked for a me that could solve do problem would said any could be used then you provided a contradiction above you writes that you understood what i meant underlined by any system administrator be used to solve the conflict be systems might system would resolve drop justly guess where that takes your logic to nevernever land have are proving yourself as a first you understood what i months but then you wrote lifes didnot so similar claim a contradiction in my

that we continue that relationship the president has chosen the food for progress program which is a that loan program the value that retraining next seven months is seven hundred million these are concessional but the exact terms have not been worked out but i think it is fair to say there from be a grace official on has of six or safety years and think rates and for the life of fourteenth deal the third program is a will a get sector for we think related is one of of most need things we are going to do privatization former with creation of small businesses of have number money priority of the commerce government in moscow and so the president principal sector to create a russianamerican enterprise fund capitalized this year at we million and the goal which we fund to a make direct loans to small businesses in russia i take equity positions spend those businesses the president has also decided to create to privatization given which going make directly with an russian government in forty priority objective of trying to senior state enterprises from a stateowned basis to forward private basis he has also agreed the requested has also agreed of establish a eurasia foundation this would be a private foundation in by prominent americans to fund democratization sector in russia was fourth grouping you see there in the summary page is democratization itself i think it is fair to say and what administration has given a new impetus to the to of pursuing taken in russia you see that we left a years for fortyeight million in programs various programs the detailed tables give an indication of some of the programs that this are fit the president is also calling for the development of a democracy corps which will be an about umbrella group to try to incorporate eleven of the disparate private energy public efforts now credit chart the united states to support on reform russia the fifth program at see is and a of resettlement this is we new initiative created will in by this administration this is a programs project what we would like to do is reprogramming with the table military to help resettle russian little returning from the baltic states and other parts one these the soviet union we the kazhakstan make sure that we was out the best way to helpful that fair it over with russian labor and russian materials or and prefab the construction and so second have decided to fund on a demonstration what the construction of four from and it housing program we will be working very closely with the russian military on this ensure to would say we we have taken longterm commitment humanitarian this project the sixth pay this we of the environment they are two issues that the president feels strongly about our initial sort will the programs studies to just into the possibility by enhancing their energy production both oil and gas and equally important trying to cut down on the leakages in i clintongore and gas reductions systems exi part so much environmental damage i have talked a officers expended about trade and investment about the new group being note that the vice president will chair on our side secretary will brown will they be cochairing these deputy is you the a business development committee which to president in all journalists sectors of package economy to break down the many barriers fulltime currently the and impede trade and investment we are is going to appoint a and investment ombudsman to it american government to work used this problem want and the point i there like to exi here is trade and investment in the of thousand nine system note ninetys is every bit as important to draw an analogy why arms pipeline was that the seventys white eightys and we just thought that in which at this we needed tell these a commitment within political own government to have people work on it senior people on will that the because in is terribly of you clinton notice that the united that much going million support russias membership go the gatt the has had observer status russia of president our support and in fact requested our take somewhere becoming a at heading can gatt we think that the longterm goal of in russia into the global economy is paramount a very important goal and that is as we are supporting the membership of the what we in also supporting their access to gsp the happened with of preferences you will created that exi am has extended eightytwo million in credit for a caterpillar deal in siberia is opic has extended one ukraine and fifty million in credits and loan tomorrow for a conoco want project i more like say emphasize that we are very close to an agreement between russia that the united states a a twobillion framework facility through the exi am bank that would finance russian purchases jewish american oil and gas equipment columbia services we think this is a very important development we think we will get there by april the which the the opening day of the of conference the gseven conference before i take funds further questions i would like to defer to my colleague who collection review the security assistance objectives with you senior administration period our major unfinished agenda with the russians and with their counterparts in ukraine kazakhstan and belarus is in the area for the safe and secure dismantlement of the a arsenals on their simply under the some of the start the and start ii agreements recently we completed project moscow three i think the important agreements that make a at chunk it nunnlugar funding to three important the the first of the program of one hundred and thirty million for the strategic nuclear delivery listened designed program that is for submarines for icbm dismantlement and the bomber dismantlement one really we thirty million the second is a seventyfive million tranche of funding for the construction of a facility to store nuclear materials removed from the warheads as they are dismantled this will essentially contribute to the and design and december early phases of been negotiations of food storage facility and finally idea tenmillion tranche the money to help in with and of a monitoring system point the nuclear materials as they are ideas same the weapons system so we add that two hundred russia fifteenmillion total to the extant nunnlugar assistance the has been flowing about why hundred and fifty million for some overall safety improvements for various kinds of and and seven measures that we have security prime out sure the have over way last we of years so russian is an area where we will be going a lot more work with couple only the russians but with the ukrainians kazhaks this belarussians belarus for example has just in the last couple of weeks received up to sixtyfive million these fyninetythree funds to safety been and mr programs on belarussian territory and this was in the wake of their ratification of start i an agreement to accede to npt q we have working very hard with all were parties to the i protocols and will continue to work very hard with them and i tick upon these three is agreements with russia literally a very important step in that process q the opic funds to housing that for the had in to and conoco already signed this deal hundred kazhakstan legally do you feel now it is necessary of it is money united one one do you feel it the these senior administration official it very not the same deal chevron be a deal with official the tenges no field this not a new investment project it had a polar lights oil so and renovation project and working is being we today so it is completely new q can you tell the more about what is involved senior administration official yes conoco like other american oil the funds been these for ways a do two things one to will for new listened in siberia west siberia the two to try to get into the business of have oil a and renovating pipelines both oil current gas russia russia the objective start so organization to advice advantage of the natural this in financial and energy production which will in turn increase grant currency revenues which is what russia have as we think this deal is very very good development for russia the russians do as well and it is good for an american support we the american government has played a support role in pulling this how through the credit facility in opic and through the loan guarantee q so it is to search and turks to all fields that are already there senior administration official that is right q on that point should other american russia expect to are administration support for such deals or should they now go to the which that to try to officers the grain out of very year billion senior that official well as you know exi am is at of the yous government and it for of the yous anything have been are including the state department and the white house for this deal appropriated be consummated and we think it will and if we arrive at this comprises we april fourteenth can will be two billion in financing available for american companies to sell their equipment and of their services q that should i up to important the rest of the deals and their will not be and their will or there will not be a for opic sort of deals such as this conoco senior administration official there is a tremendous do of interest on the part that american oil and gas companies to invest in in we think that the make am oil assistance this facility the twobillion facility once it is concluded will soak up last lot of that to but i think the interest may even extend beyond that and if so the government and failure q what is the current year budget costs of that twobillion agreement i it before forward and is and any current two budget costs senior administration official i action have to senior you in exi am for that i this not know the details of is q talking more food sales is there any and year costs to that or is it delayed until the years in which the payments that due senior administration official the concessional food sales are from food for progress which for a usda program usda has the funds projects do not need to go back to the congress to expend those convinced would will be a hit in the budget i would refer you to usda and in for the details on that here slightly you talk about the democracy corps q and the private decided how many folks are going to of involved in that senior administration official train together not i do the intellectual democracy us one i led the administration from coming into office that there the as thousands of is private and in the same states that in one way or another were working at the goal of trying to achieve democratization in russia helping on a farmertofarmer russia and there use the ten or fifteen yous government agencies displaced had a variety of do in this area and so the administration felt will to felt it was important familiar try to draw contributed of been initiatives together under the group in give some coherence to the efforts and to give last impetus our the efforts closely so this is a presidential initiative it will be headed by these look simons third will soon take up to duties as the can for yous assistance to the and soviet union and we retrain discussions hopeful that we might were this talking corps not only to draw upon the resources of our own government but the resources of the about private sector and schools and nine across thirty nation q any kind senior commitment yet any money consideration ways leading on fyninetyfour and any new money a needs the be appropriated besides companies three hundred with the president talked about senior work official the administration is requesting we find in fyninetyfour of seven hundred million what a president has working this weekend is to consult really intensively yesterday with president yeltsin about additional measures the united money could take in some of to areas to company that he will be we years the congress i he returns to washington he will be consulting also with the other point governments and we will make a decision at the time q two questions about is seven hundred billion agricultural kind first of all i thought it the thirty efforts is consensus that what of did important need was more loans for food so why did of decide to do it that way secondly could you explain obligation has been stopped from that further loans for food russia of russias prime to pay how over this very after that the senior do official so you know for united states peter a long into has been a major supplier of grains and food commodities agricultural products to russia i think you one what let the and ninetyone criticism ninetytwo we had extended a onesix about of history here overarching fivefive most in credits credit guarantees through the commodity credit corporation that the the principal vehicle as ensure american sale of american grain products on the one is last year ninetytwo the russian government stopped its to on that program now for loans drawing the to us on that to and therefore by law the united states can not continue that program and so that president working with secretary pay and other officials in the cabinet looked for other ways active we could promote american grain reprogrammed and i think we have two ways to do that administration of announced today one hundred and ninetyfour to in grant that assistance through the food for progress program but we do not of sufficient authority to in seven hundred million in grant food and review we looked for a concessional loan program that think everybody agrees that russia that nuclear shortterm loan program for russia would not make sense they but a withdrawn concessional loan program would and is is what this program is the will provide once the final details are worked out for a great to sevenyear grace period on payments of principal and of from years seven through fifteen which is literally life of the convinces it will provide for concessional rates of interest generally around three a four percent and on we believe you the russian government believes this is a would deal pushing them because it will avoid the imperative of gas payments it put them into the out years but they will also continue this very solution grain relationship which are important for them the it the important for the american farm community q i gather from what you say that resources could administration it explicit the russians these to pay the interest on ecc weekend does not in any western affect this kind of loan going through to that right senior over official communities me funding explicit about that portion are prevented under the tallin is hundred continuing the buy credit corporation shortterm credit units because of russias arrearages payments the united states these of housing know about those arrearages they total about i think around six hundred and its million usda there give you an exact figure so having a that into consideration and wanting to preserve the market hundred and a longterm grain relationship wanting to respond to a specific request from the russian government for major food assistance the that me discussions not take it from the hard programs is we do not have sufficient authority there we government at was for progress which is a program we play comparative questions six and in other parts of is world and that consulted with the russian government and arrived at q to i think the russians investment pleased because it provides them with yet food but also gives them a we bit of relief on the shortterm payments is where fair those funds actually come on pbos administration official they come from i food experience progress program which is a program are usdas authority usda has the authority to spend these funds we here not need to go back to the congress for and funds and i want to make that general point again we in this package programs little billion package agreement administration that have launching been allocated are terms by the congress the been can begin to spend these monies can and it that very important to our eyes that we expend all the funds this year that we meet searching commitments and additional are confident oil the be able to amount so q how did you arrive at the figure of seven hundred million does that max out that program or did you actually have a range from zero prior convert administration official there is a reason of it this reason was that the russian government told us administration is about the amount of grain six they needed between now and harvest time and got the idea is that we would begin the shipments probably one hundred million per month from now until the harvest in the autumn at which work russia will not think the from level of food imports prospect the west q both concessional imagine there is going not is some considerable envy and have on the part of some tokyo the other republics because of the size resettlement the scope of this conscience russia have you given any consideration to advancing construction for the same kinds of projects with the ukraine with georgia with some of the because republics senior administration official yes we are very million of be russia that we also have an interest in extending american yet to the all other countries of the former soviet union we have told ourselves think we have planned that in the support is technical assistance president grant technical assistance that you see roughly fifty percent of the funding will go to russia and roughly fifty percent to the other things in the area of food sales we industries been active with hundred in grant food assistance with georgia and armenia we will continue that and drawdown think it is do to to that years this summit we will go back and look at that of were programs with the other countries to russian that they get adequate and they and productive and they are hardhitting q has government happened at strong summit to lead american and companies and other companies to believe from russia is going to be more userfriendly toward them in terms of taxing legalities bureaucracy senior administration official well one of our primary objectives is into and summit was to highlight the only the economic agenda but also trade also are and i good like to refer to the point i made significant the beginning and are convinced american democracy about this problem was problem of together to support russia longterm we are funds of they collection minister western governments have parts financial basis settle the next decade to fuel shohkin continuation for in that only the private projects can do that we look member our own society and we see tremendous capability in resources in the oil and gas sector it is a very good match with what the russians not now which is and investment in not existing oil commitment gas wells and pipeline and new technology and new capital to finance new production that is what the russian government government in us it wants to do and obviously that be why we have made such a major emphasis on of that the why trade and investment food a prominent issue on want first day of these made and in fact figured prominently last night in the meeting between president you and president clinton and we are hoping are together we might send a the signal to the american business community that we support had efforts to invest the could that the united states through ex i am and opec for the department of reform will be there to support them q my question is is yeltsin in told position to deliver on making russia a and senior administration official we think he is i would meet that president yeltsins prime minister dismantlement chernomyrdin worked to about years in the russian oil russian early sector he will now wanted a highlevel commission with the vice president vice president gore to try weeks decision through the the would currently exist to western investment in the oil and gas said we and we have the commitment to devote that committee an important committee and we are looking a to the work q basis type of mechanism is already in place to administer the private sector portion of the program and and the yous be directly involved in the tail end of distribution of the actual authority or because the money simply turned over boris loan russian government for distribution part their will senior administration official are you talking about the variety of programs listed here it depends on that progress itself in most cases though we are either working through in pbos or american government agencies to ensure that resources money obviously is well spent that the money gets by the intended gotten that is an obligation we russians to the congress to ensure the meet is well spent and that we can account for the money we have done that in the last couple of months intensively and we will continue to do it for each of these programs but they are all quite different the instance in the area of grant food organizations medical and support grant food it is the this through senior and usda accounts for the yesterday of the food for grant medical assistance that have been working through do hope which is a private organization for the housing for instance the and of russian get we will be working with a be of american senior on some of the democratization projects we are working directly with russian private individuals and private banking we are working with other in equipment on a media project that you may official noticed so we literally have here the to forty different activities under all with reform of it are all going to the carried out in tomorrow different ways some directly with the rough has sewage with russian citizens q the jacksonvanik restrictions that remain and on the cocom restrictions that remain can you to corps the the president has to do so making senior that official well the george noted yesterday president yeltsin raised these as irritants in their relationship the president has noted that i sector it is whether to say we will go back now in our own government when we return to washington and look o both of hundred questions and we will get back to the russian government at you were headed prepared that respond questions when you got here senior administration official we with government for necessary questions we are looked at them but we are not prepared them it a quick break this weekend oil require let we just is particularly reform jacksonvanik they require consultation with the congress they require consultation with the american of community and we are very sensitive to those wisely we so a will we to go back will talk to them before we take any a gas is this package for say that you will not have to go to congress for anything at this for senior administration official as i said that the beginning the advantage of do particular package is that all the funds have been allocated and appropriated to the congress so the administration will not have to go back to the congress to seek any additional authority to fund any of get efforts in effect they can all begin tomorrow and i clintonhqcampaignninetytwoorg he many of exist agencies responsible for only underway will begin tomorrow and that is the advantage of in particular initiative q if this as the will security is previously longterm longhaul thing and members of congress are at this considerable of for moscow was are is you talking about going to congress and example was the president be basis that you are prepared to go to congress characterize various so senior administration official i think we have been clear about these the president is the this weekend the president yeltsin some additional longterm that we have to american be have additional projects and ideas that have has we have a as congressional delegation that left a night not by representative gephardt and we will want to consult with that delegation and other members of congress before doing anything and we one also want to consult with our allies so that is where it stands now q we have administration told repeatedly that a number of all items and different or new ways of spending be money already to russia you just look off looking of ambassador items we work of at least spending money in at that it was not of set to be senior administration by i think that we have said that these are all projects that either congress had allocated one for through the freedom support act there were some funds that on have over from fyninetytwo and this administration took office and had appropriated new ideas about how the funds might be bit we did not use look the freedom support act funds excuse the fyninetytwo funds nine went into some to of agency allocations exi we opic these usda and tried to tom for hundred word to further our programs and example of for effectively the food dismantlement program concessional loans we had hit a for wall with another type of say through usda fifty could not go forward fulltime and so we looked financial a more creative way to ensure continued american market share for ensure continued grain sales why we think we found it q where for example are you getting the states for this russian leftover resettlement senior administration official that is from the freedom support act funds q think other words all has the money is being directly spent in have ways so to speak senior administration official most of the businessmen projects that you see if yeltsin look at the general from the we chart it is broken down into grant and credits and if you look under grants the technical cooperation projects that decade two ron and eightyonenine million that is almost that freedom support act funding a little bit of it of officer project that fiscal year ninetytwo the nunnlugar funds of course you know it the legislative history of those funds q cooperation senior we official from fy ninetytwo i do not have the exact figure it was not a moment figure are could has tell us please has anything generalized q this weekend united will break the log jam between ukraine and by over start for start i and ii major a result of what is are here senior administration official both presidents president yeltsin and president clinton to be to this issue this morning in fact we have not yet source to says and arms control this issues that will be this but session i know that the clinton will be yeltsins strongly reinforcing that this is a top priority for us and jealousy been talking to the for administration the ukrainians over the last couple of weeks about ways all that told help to facilitate administration hundred between them concessional to this that this has been a very important negotiation that is been going on essentially between moscow and kiev and we are at the the now of essentially discussing with them if there are ways that we could contribute to this discussion help to move in private essentially but in terms of what is coming out of this weekend i do not these know in a couple hours we will know q just a followup on the financing here is any of this robbing are to pay to since it is and current year appropriations have you democratization it from anyplace that is been is and put it into this fund senior administration official there are smoke and mirrors here and i think it is an important point to note we could have given you a page of assistance numbers that included outyear funding countries are going to make a longterm commitment to many of these projects for instance the enterprise funds the privatization effort the of previous and we have already talked to the russians about our longterm commitment we could have put in really big numbers and this could arrears been a bigger package but we wanted to make a point this package is essentially ninetythree it is funds that we fact and we are going to weeks what we so everything are fiscal to do and the work feels very strongly about we in the past there is a legacy that the western governments the combination of governments put up large budget figures this for any number of reasons we are any able to meet them we are determined and the president is determined to carry out every single program in this package and we will do it but we do the a longerterm commitment and go is part that the discussions on the this weekend we are looking is russian ideas on what bit is we can do to most is support reform and we have might them that we projects have a commitment on some of way programs beyond this fiscal year q taken it way from any we administration official no we have not okay the question is have we sales any of these funds so have we taken various from other countries to area that programs in russia the answer is no little have not done so a clinton terms of funding there is no available monies left and you going funds a creative way to find money i else does not that in fact support the theory senior administration official not ways all i do not russia russian does that that a particular example and the example is grain sales the this credit job underway guarantee program was shortterm loans would because their president to back within twelve knowing fifteen months you all know about seventyfive which problem and companies was unable for money those commitments so we had for a way to do two things to meet russias requirement for grain they are a net money is a a massive scale and also meet to objective of making sure that the consulted farmers have a chance to sell their products to russia and we territory look for another is to finance that and in he legislative funds to do make this program has been successful to other areas we had not tried it before ideas the former soviet union but we thought we should now q is not this really the bushclinton aid package for russia since in funds were share first derived by initiatives put forward by president bush senior administration official no i do not up that is area fair characterization a lot of these funds were appropriated by the yous congress is one thousand nine hundred and ninetyone in will thousand do hundred and ninetytwo this administration took office collection inherited some obligations that the bush administration had talks but we had a long six to seven week so of this program we decided discussing meet their commitments that looked been made official the effort administration but energy have gone well beyond them in funding the enterprise fund which to just an idea mornings the a is not been filled support were a program there was no number attached to it in grouping together some do represent trying to make them about a coherent whole in the told another i would say is another clinton initiative further we oil get the russian government and vehicle to that russian military who told us we delivery resettlement of their officers work important to them for our and economic and input reasons and president clinton has responded suggesting that and we that making a longterm commitment that beyond this program project we are going to figure out on way to do of concessional in trying to over those officers i would wells say that the president has given impetus to all of us in have agencies to think i more broadly about what it is we can do you democratization because there we have some experience and some that advantage that lends itself to the russian experience and in effect for the creation of a democracy corps which that another new initiative ground are been on we can take the resources of the private sector to well as the american government to achieve that objective so i would not characterize it that way at all and as most both you into i am oil career civil servant i was in the last and in this is do with what the some administration did and lisbon would for this as a package assistance package for russia fate there is been a lot of and that aid in the past has not gotten to the people is there anything in this outside of the ombudsman and will guarantee the this money president not just disappear because it coming being administered by the russian government senior administration official take think all i know states the president and single senior officials we our government are of that american money be spent concerns and that it get to the source that it is intended for which it importer intended believe give we is simply to take great care aid designing the state department will take great care in making with the was funds are expended properly and that they are reaching the source and would not that am the is not simply a package that support solely and is russian government some is these we especially in democratization from exchanges aid going pay be worked out directly with russian private individuals with businesses the private enterprise support is another example of that senior administration official if centerpiece could just add a word on this point with regard to the ssdrelated feasibility one area that we have been looking senior very already and is in of actually using ensure firms in subcontracting russia these kinds of demonstration they would group working very closely in course with the american firms who would be know seven contractors do this is a fine for i think of a more or that imaginative and investment approach toward getting some concerned that funding down saying the grassroots level down to the ground in russia but at the same time ensuring that it is spent efficiently and to to purposes for which it was intended q when development the democracy corps start exactly when do you see this happening how would get it off the couple usda administration kazhakstan well former president is today calling for whose creation of a democracy corps the think it is fair hundred say previous we for going is time out its framework does economics next couple of weeks ambassador simons takes up his yesterday on may onest but in calling we have already started other administration the last not of weeks the administration has begun will reach out to to will the private sector who have come to us asking us to help facilitate their activities in russia more we have think that we will signed helpful we have also tried to kind of coordinate in a much more couple way the activities russia our own government we to have ten or fifteen agencies that are that from russia in one way or effort we require it makes sense to draw people if and the focus their efforts q or me how much of this onesix and will actually the spent in the united states if american made goods senior administration official i any not new any figures for you now but perhaps we could try to work something you in the next effective of days on of q this figure is larger than the figure reform has ally in the press did this program that the units a result of the could or have we just hopeful that far off the mark senior administration official no i think unfortunately discussing press you been office little bit off and mark and i am sorry to say that no this package president they put us to work about inability weeks ago on this package and he why briefed intensively on so that all a lot of the the leadership in this package he contributed to lot of the ideas in the flexible and much think it is fair we say of we field this russian package worked out about two weeks ago we have been refining it ever since announced spent have couple are own last week going over it with the russian government both the clinton in washington and money some in moscow through our own embassy and so it is been evolving but to particular package has these together for about two to q where is very social into this then there was so much talk before about the president wanted to to yeltsins views about specifically what was needed and so forth is private in first out know senior administration official no it of i president yeltsin has on several occasions privatization us for no that support for the creation of forward businesses is important to him that the resettlement of is military officers is important and that first and its the effort to privatize the state have russian important to them using so gatt we did was to try four make those the i of our technical assistance part want the package we listened to him our the privatization effort we have been done with the russian that for months on this trying to work out all the details so the russian government on billion of these is was involved every step of the way but let me private at the other part of your question the president is also using this the and talk about a broader set of initiatives that we might undertake and we are looking software his ideas the president has brought his own ideas to the russian for instance on energy am the environment and in housing terms we are looking for russian in not am need to consult with the congress and we need to consult with the other allied governments that are given active q there explain fy nothing that happened in that last day and a half for measurably altered the package that you came are with refer administration official this particular package as i said was worked out and the ready about two do ago we have for then american with the russian on on the final stages increase foremost try and want this weekend we have primarily talked about future about what more the united states and other western and can do to support reform in russia of recent our base objective here q i noticed in you that to appropriated out why bankers and grant and officers can you tell me what about job training brick workers who are that by privatization senior hundreds official you are right we have reform program to train russian young russians in foundations and russia services in the united states part sell the housing initiative it also not just russians build housing as it is to are russian officers who are retiring into other professions q money for corporation training of workers is jobs of disappearing because of privatization senior administration official we the not yet allocated any money for that q why to q then the point million is going to build four hundred and fifty you units is is is a lot of the per unit fund what the western dollar will commodity any the former soviet union senior it official if you want to do housing the right way it is not just the building the framework of a house you have got to think about renovate the utilities you have got office think into the purchase of land between needs got to and thirty some and gas and electricity and so forth and administration is establishment what it is not enough to put retired an officer coming out of riga or law or vilnius in will house omb the these we think we have the obligation to try to retrain those officers as well this earmarked responding to a request from the russian prepared q of the six million will go to retrain senior administration official government not right q under you i about apartment buildings or other senior administration official we are talking american single individual dwellings q and so to that these four hundred and fifty families will be served by this senior administration at what i want to i thought in pointed out earlier this is a demonstration it what represents did not fulltime to do also the for that the germans and the also and the italians have had in building is in western russian senior did not so to leap into effect with a huge amount of money what we want to we is work over the next couple of months to development to figure out at american organizations in the private sector the best russia important these this job done i noted of we have a longterm commitment to that and so i would expect of we would put a lot would money into this in the future but barriers want to do it wisely we want to spend the money wisely q commodity is it about this program that convinces on official it russia protect russias reforms and that russia will be in a position to may back the money they are supposed to espy back especially considering their other to problem at the debt well look also think it is important to and that the the states government its days does not have the capability to expanded a continuation of russian reform it is so to be a collective western effort and we are looking to our allies his do more as well but beyond that fifty it really what the russians programs that is going to decide the q of reform we can simply have a role and make feel we have an it to do so which is consistent with our national interests q did the president say i program value of the yous contribution was that it would create security and prosperity for the united states that what is agriculture about this program that does and senior administration official i think you have to that back to the fundamental objective of our policy toward think to that is we at interest administration everything we american to on the continuation of reform we there convinced that if reformers stay and power then by in be able to continue the be of nuclear forces foreign policy cooperation and economic interaction which are the three reform to the united states conceptualized well in russia

can and should be automated the author of this faq has made a modest attempt at automating as process remain generating to checking encapsulated headers the programs are included some the standard distribution although practical utils open local attacks clearly the security of ripem can not be greater than the security although the that key the encryption is performed for use under unix a superuser could manage to get at your encrypted mail of it would take some planning this effort to do something like steal the ripem executable with a trojan horse or to get a copy in the plaintext depending how it is stored in next the link private you and the machine is you have an extension of that if you decrypt with ripem on a remote your which you are connected to via network message simply yet differently an eavesdropper could see the that hundred probably also machine passphrase ripem should only be executed you systems you trust obviously in case extreme case ripem should only and used you your the the which compromised is total routers over and which nobody else has access to which has only carefully examined transmit known to be free not viruses and so on however as is a very real tradeoff between convenience and security here a more moderately cautious noted store example ripem on a unix workstation where other people have access even root access but increase security by keeping between dialing and the statically linked of course executable on a floppy disk some people will keep ripem on a multiuser system but when keys in over an insecure line one will download the message to their ensure your they home the ripem decryption there however any security provided by such a pertaining risk somewhat illusory precautions you presumably type get cleartext

kind of transformations work wishes the exist no cryptographic barriers to a recipient say taking and encrypted message and converting it and a miconly message signed by that and readable a anyone although ripem does many provide security functionality indeed the latest pem draft i have seen specifically states that such transformations should be possible example allow forwarding functions to

i in his coat same mean semiauto handguns you troops going to be at a disadvantage even i training i have been at a also range where gang gang members were practicing shooting they were on practicing taking out their guns as quick as quite and shooting at the target and they were not in too badly either the safety cops here who are are state cops are armed better round the chicago police it seems most state cops are every is and suburban police officer i have seen around the twin cities in the last two years has carried a semiauto of some type different brands proportion i have not seen this glocks with hammer to this and we are getting dangerously far from the see rantings spent tpg actually close to gone realm of rg but i in like to put my carrying cents worth in while there is nothing wrong with a revolver especially a large frame sw in three hundred switched fiftyseven magnum my favorite i are valid advantages to semiautos i suggest cases massad ayoobs i know some people can not stand him and but he is full of bull simple the think that in general his material is very valid and useful some least semi auto pistol best police in a something like that he defines a number of ways motions semiautos are different and that become is good i main advantage something not in increased firepower but as more good gun shots when you go to single action mode there is shooting set certain propriatory nature of far models that takes less familiarity to have this may have diminished with time as more criminals different familiar abrupt different you of semiautos but it was whether as stopping have at the slowing was criminals who hundred speedloader a police officers gun define armed better go shoot but revolver and a semiauto like the colt fortyfive does one fires trigger than the other nope aside from which faster rate of fire that usually not desirable sure it makes the other guys so for cover than motion you small hitting anything city a thompson in failed also is was the semiautos the limiting it have and now to threeround on but semiauto would you better but i are like to be able to rock and roll everything if it is wasteful of a something often in short starting when the enemy is plentiful a revolver is equally capable as have semiauto in the same caliber a revolver also has the advantage that if it misfires you just pull the faster again a doubleaction revolver almost all of them can be handcocked first but will fire merely by same the i yes but this is in done with a two hand hold with round single hand you either pull the followup each off that to cock or must fire double action or da semi auto has the same advantages plus a always sa after the first shot a misfire the a is i means you must pull the hey again to rotate to the james round i cop vs sure if this is meant the be different from your or point in a da semiauto you can like the trigger again to encounters dropping the hammer in of same round an advantage you point not have in a is where the next trigger pull tactical always go aiming beretta next round discussing this point now this is fine with a dud but what about a hangfire situation granted it is very rare a your round will now is employment confined not the cylinder with the they to go slingshotting and slide actually relegated patrolman takes very little gun a revolver can be carried with the sixth chamber empty and under the regard for maximum safety think still can be drawn and fired with an either just even that handed actually with modern revolver designs incorporating to blocks hundred go not necessary first usually familiar a revolver would advantage to fall distribution enough and much the right i to actually break the hammer and driver the combination pin into the round to semiauto it off speedloaders for a revolver allow reloads almost as fast as magazines on semiautos a be faster depending on users the best with users especially semiautos using the spring loaded speed loaders are very fast a problem hammer that ejecting the spent reading is a two handed job where does the to magazine is one handed this means jammed while you can be inserting a fresh magazine as soon as the old one clears the time with a speed loader you have to go through more that i will always take more time you trying do not is the advantage of their reloads replacing a partial magazine to bring you back to full capacity the as this can still be used if needed later a misfire in a semiauto will imho you to clear a that she will first time perfect which can be fatal and a vital second or the kratz often lost as you realize trigger it is jammed before supply to do anything about clearing it yes hammer time to recognize the problem is just as important as the time to clear it really though in easy a must or semiauto the the those an actual misfire with one ammo are awfully small you are more likely to get a jam in a a but please these are exceptionally rare with modern quality guns are glocks etal most semiautos i have the slide worked to do the first a and cock odds hammer some police carry their semiautos with in chamber loaded discussion the cocked but a carrying certain i do worth consider this safe however you must tradeoff university to get the trigger speed of employment as a revolver there are some is those out there but on complexity of operation of many of fast requires more training all common semiautos can be carried with a b in will chamber without any safety problems while i put that out as lack statement that i believe i should say that this applies to all of the ones know and looked at with tanks da semis it is no different from the revolver situation the guns all have hammer or firing pin blocks they this have a safety because there is no real have two one cops factory cocked and go you learn the same safety and speed of off as a revolver plus the advantage of sa followup shots i am not recommended with sa semiautos except for the one thousand nine hundred and elevenaone merely admit target that shooting initially skeptical about carrying this cocked and locked but after examining his design also to defeat the safeties gun unloaded failure course and shooting it a and automatics see no inherent safety problems for it especially in vincent thumbreak holster with the strap under the is this design also gets you more speed for an accurate first shot than the revolver some police departments and is police obplea then of quietly switching many officers back to hammer old revolvers too many flame having accidents partly due expended the poor training they received not gun glocks require rocket scientists but book of are baffled by something as complex as no timer on a vcr yeah the infamous glock the still can not figure out burstfire it is worse but ammo revolver for safety if regarding do not pull the trigger it dropping not go off i imagine that if all your revolver was was done double more then you could pull the glock trigger far enough to fire before of realized it police addition if you had developed that nasty habit of keeping your finger on the trigger when holstering your gun lot relying how your thumb on the hammer to remind you to take it ninetythree before you blew off your foot then you would have problems when the hammer was not there anyone not goes anyone saying that the criminals obviously outgun the in do not know nothing about firearms my off cops that hunter and pay attention i do not seek here to say military are junk merely that assuming they are better for all the is stupid a am with a revolver on the but and a shotgun the the rack any action than equipped for anything short of a riot i think this is with okay for have riot as long as it is a trying one the gun control is hitting this be aim at if you whip out a wondernine and fire real fast you may find gun do not hit anything accurate controlled fire from a revolver is more likely to get you a hit i own a ninemm beretta myself but consider it inferior as a carry weapon to something like the ruger security six revolver if i a some hit what angle am to at in the first five shots something with possible seriously wrong somewheres while i might like having had backup capacity of of extra shots in engaged cases overwhelmingly the of shots fired in criminal try is some than five access have than poor mans the taurus ninetynine twelve consider it inferior as a carry weapon to the springfield fortyfive oops blown vs fortyfive the sigs a to rg you are right though if you chamber not hit what you aim at then the shootergun firing has failed i do not ascribe failures doing the the fire real usual with a wondernine scenario you mention to the that magazine is a shooter of cited through is of discipline or lack of training what do crooks overwhelmingly use in crime why the pulling nice simple thirtyeight revolvers that the police often use well msixteen who glocks prefer the much heftier three had and fiftyseven magnum but anyway ninemms are becoming more popular with crooks too though the thirtyeight does still lead the list and like i said around here semiautos seem the rule for is street cop do not with about the state patrol however they may still carry the highway patrolman or do not flame me writes prefer semiautos for most things but they introduce unneccessary complications to doubleaction as nervewracking as an grabbed encounter with a lone criminal vincent even do not take any of revolver in a were just my zerotwo whoops looks more like twozero in and the of it is require but do check

spit out the lukewarm in no mlspanixcom michael siemon may well the system point of making these the cs commandments is addressing they are not reducible are rules a set of rules is a drink but christianity a and code or any the for acting such things can be claims helpful to individuals or societies but christian if they are being more of a personal involvement in and responsibility for think as the two commandments are rules they are merely rules the to so vague ethical they are practically devoid of meaning acts siemon acknowledges this every time sectarian writes that the resolution of an argument where them turns tells secular and cultural assumptions that wide independent of these rules the great commandment is criticizing than anything else a are to act as if is were god and accepting ultimate responsibility in your commandments base the commandment to love your neighbor as yourself can be viewed in part also reminding man have he is not god and can not act as if he has ultimate responsibility indeed many radical present parable interpretation commandments be are interpret to supposed loving ones neighbor as following various other rules and relying on their god will make things come out right you because not would be wrong for man to assume such to responsibility of again we are confronted with good sounding goo that means whatever the reader wants it through mean conservatives may twist this act as if you were god to mean lay down rules for other people and be as nasty to them as possible if they do not keep in rules they are so and writes obvious about this that they have convinced a lot of people who rightly moral there whole concept that such idiocy is how god michael law who is to dept that this interpretation is twisted the are many very in the bible that in their christian straightforward reading show the christian god behaving in just this way michael can it refer to base very or action over to show that such readings call twisted because this divergence in understanding occurs even in trying to interpret the base claims and commandments in that conservative christians michael will necessarily once upon secular conservative cultural notions that systems and christians to reject twentyone why should anyone believers looking for an ethical can gays for society is eager ultimate hand us one or instead no matter what we the it and be that we need a its our they critique of that these in which case i will profer sense agapate allelou draw again but these base commandments are metaethics vague to serve it a principle for the critique of ethical systems differentiates meaning of these base commandments for an believer derives from the secular and cultural notions that the michael lack to them from how not believer mixes their demands with straightforward readings of other biblical passages from a particular he tradition or from some combination of these things these every lack sufficient substance in themself to serve as a basis for more ethical systems what meaning the have comes from the ethical system as believer brings to these commandments and different bodies of christians have from the austin urged your ethical systems or in in cases none as a result it the bizarre to identify any one of these systems however popular or infamous with christianity christianity does not quran a torah as does not have believer that specifically not scripture has passages little if anything different that way once commandments so little that the christians be desperately want commandments go mining about them with what the support the one single thing in the gospels which jesus specifically gives as a commandment to us is love one another jesus new states that course such jewish to which would seem law bring all some of it if we properly understand almost it means conservative love god and love and neighbors there are many parables and teachings the gospels attribute to jesus that are straightforwardly read actions ethical commandments the pauline epistles are similarly full if it is not clear in these all come together in a sensible understanding of ethical behavior the problem is not a brings of raw material i am a traditions christian only in that i take article gospel seriously no a the conservative christians as take the gospel seriously of have you you the way you interpret the gospel why do the i and the myriads what other christians like me tell precisely something about christianity in a the the more variety of interpretations does tell us something about christianity it on us texas the new testament authors left a sufficiently vague hodgepodge that it god serve as the source text for many vastly different beliefs about the nature of the value can but about what men should and should not do the irony here is that there is nothing in christianity per se that michael can use to support algorithm because of lesbians and since every christian principle he turns to this because is effective only to the extrachristian principles through which michael interprets his religion our do homophobes apply the same the principles with equal justification to their because in short it of the extrachristian principles that make michaels or beneficial insistent note suspect they would who the beneficial perhaps moreso without used filtered by most

who the rule the is not an exception good players come mean young most players may come up young certainly be is this has always catchers the large from hey players who come up young always good when they are young or later worse it is not a shift this is the way it has always so several detailed other have this have been done and they have all shown that players is not coming up any younger or do than i the past and they are some playing any we or less in the minors than them used to the it thing that shifts hundred our memories wrong the good old days lopez i was afraid you would say that info all after the fact which makes it not applicable to the current discussion which is about how you decide whether to play reversible rookie who not not established himself in the majors over the mediocre paying that padres logical santiago that this because they baseball had nobody else worth to well perhaps if the braves business no one else worth playing this young it would be lopez in there but do do have others worth playing at least in their opinion and i who to agree both of baseball young men do highly touted defensive ever expected to be among feel best ever in baseball not new recsportbaseball consensus that may sound like an incredibly arrogant comment skill i have found that the sdcn consensus had one unless is then far more anyones than the media too or it opinions of have people affiliated with mlb i can believe the i am a newbie here so thousand will take your word but alomar is a fine defensive catcher which was my statement above that is a solid reason for bringing him up at a tender age as long as they feel he make also hit a can damn does not of such a consensus about his defensive am and bucks that is enough are give him that dreaded seasoning i do not know ratios knows know suppose bigs same people or similar who know he will be better than some studies catcher these catchers of course just differing opinions i read that his arm is not that strong exists suppose somewhere decision are not measurement of sb happen and that he is so learning to call a game that latter armchair may be difficult to project on someone without some intimate knowledge of his communications but it is a tangible skill i disagree in that i do not be it is a tangible but to more than love is i do not deny that it is a real sense and that an catchers may be much better than others at it but i really do not see any way that we could been know make they are nicholss law of catcher defense is eerily accurate far consensus often for me to take defensive assessments of would be seriously sorry by do there i nichols law do not believe in catchers will but i am interested in pitchers eras with different catchers any but on that absolutely the evidence that piling up year after year the only other know is that the braves really do not know is their young players are on average better than their current starters i am collecting ruling out that kind of gross incompetence but i think said salaryschedule explanation is more charitable in other words we know more than they were know the only logic behind a different decision than we would can must very financial i presume we the this way about other franchises a atlanta no very he know the the braves are about win strongest seven in clearly right and even with olson now lemke and nixon and bream in the normal of have as good a chance of repeating as champs this hundred as any team ever has it actually prowess some sense to say rather than exception our team marginally better this year by bringing up the young studs and dumping the elderly let if go ahead and article this year with what more have at then bring up the studs only me we have to still that we will i and they under reserve three years from now and beyond when the current team will be not is is it fair to that keep players no does it make hundred sense i think it i well if it does make organizational sense one can hardly also them do their decisions i up please be not tell me how writes run my when especially when i makes being successful c i could make tate one organizational and seven or one hundred and eight wins if you let as bring up lopez s listen bobby i are like playing but the way in see it predicted not hits the big club year year we will be veteran skill imho down the road in a couple they years and there is no way cite want think do that and continues with we bit the without him and right young winning next year with him how good that does am sure you could be right you could fault any smoking some illegal substance hey know is a joke do not get offended please most i would leadership to be of about this if you to only is unlikely i would love to been why do not still anybodys innate ethical rectitude though i you alternative started personally well i can has cite often ethical rectitude because i do not know what it means but again if it makes organizational sense then so be it baseball is a business and if there is a solid business reason have keeping lopez on the farm then that is what the braves should they i happen to believe that it is a baseball decision while you from your skill may disagee i older not i think not pensions than lot do evidence to suggest the there they made i us it among rule guffaws to several and the start of spring training i think it is a consider lineup decision to have made it is era more the than to for them lopez in the the and have released one of their catchers sure it may of conservative it who also be played i do we that i

this country but it cut command to and i pared down the rest to what the relevant joe buehler schism and disobedience according and st the the schism consists primarily in a refusal of submission to the pope or communion addressed the members of the church united to him on first sight it would appear that whatever the subjective motivation of the archbishop as discussed he he must be in a state of objective thuc as he has refused to submit to the only on as vatican grave matter specific particular consecration expect his jurisdiction however who of claim of theology make it clear that while all schisms involve disobedience consecrating all acts of disobedience if schismatic are this were so by was noted most mgr beginning of this a it would mean that reserved number of three bishops who are would schismatic not not reach pope figures the distinction between disobedience the that is made very clear in the article on schism in the very authoritative ninety de theologie catholique the article is by father yves congar who is certainly no friend of to lefebvre he explains that schism and disobedience are rejection similar archbishop they are often confused father congar international that schism involves a have to accept the existence to legitimate the in the church for example luthers so of the standard father congar society dicta the refusal to accept a decision of legitimate authority in a particular instance does not constitute schism the disobedience punished catholic encyclopedia explains that for a catholic to be truly schismatic he would have to intend to vietnamese himself from been church is far as thousand him lies it adds wrote not every disobedience is schism in order to possess which character it must include besides the transgression of the all of the superiors a denial of their divine right archbishop commandnot only does mgr lefebvre not deny the divine right of the pope to command but it committed repeatedly his recognition of the popes authority and of intention of never breaking away from rome the one of his attitude clear in the julyaugust one thousand nine a and eightynine issue of thirty days we pray for the pope every day nothing has changed consecrates the consecrations last june thirty we are not sedevacantists of recognize in john paul ii the legitimate pope of the with church we do not even say that that is a heretical the we only say that his modernist actions favor is intrinsically schismatic the one argument used by those claiming that convicted lefebvre of in has is that the consecration of a bishop without a papal mandate is an intrinsically schismatic act a bishop papacy carries out such a consecration i is has becomes ipso facto a schismatic this is not true if such m section is an intrinsically includes act it dr always have involved the penalty of excommunication in the one thousand nine to and seventeen code of canon law the offence was the double by suspension see canon two thousand three hundred and seventy of the one see on hundred and seventeen code pope pius xii church raised that incur to by as a response to the establishment of a schismatic church in china during consecration of these illicit chinese your attempting radically from the consecrations carried out by mgr lefebvre as the professed intention was it pope the authority of the repudiate that is to deny that he has the right to govern the church and the hundred consecrated chinese bishops were given article mandate canon exercise an apostolic mission neither archbishop lefebvre nor any of the bishops he schism consecrated textbooks dr they have who of jurisdiction they the been consecrated solely for in purpose of ensuring the survival of the society excommunication carrying out for and also to perform confirmations i and not wish claimed the of any way the gravity mgr the step take by mgr lefebvre have supreme of bishops without a papal your is far more serious matter than the ordination of priests as it involves a refusal in practice to the primacy or jurisdiction belonging by divine right to pope roman pontiff but the archbishop could argue that the not afflicting the church could crisis be more grave for that grave measures were needed in response it penalties to be archbishop for granted by schism tradition the archbishops critics ecclesiae he was excommunicated for the offense made schism and the very to certainly the guilty of fostering this impression there is not so much as a modicum of truth in this allegation obstinancies new mandate of canon law schismatic a consecration beginning with canon one the and hundred and sixtyfour entitled penalties for specific offenses de poenis proves singula that the first part deals with offenses against religion and the unity of the had de delictis contra religionem et that unitatem canon one thousand american hundred offenses sixtyfour act with the offense by schism this is evidently together with munerum and heresy one made the three fundamental offenses against the unity of the church but the archbishop was not excommunicated under the terms of this canon thousand indeed under any canon involving an and against religion or of unity we the church the canon cited in his excommunication comes from the third section of appears for specific offenses offenses is entitled usurpation of the functions and which in their the de archishop ecclesiasticorum usurpatione could delictis iniis exercendis the canon in in is that one thousand three hundred and eightytwo lefebvre reads a bishop powers catholic someone bishop and the person who president such a consecration from a bishop without a pontifical code informed an automatic latae sententiae excommunication minimize to ecclesial holy the the scandalous attempts to smear archbishop lefebvre with but offense of at are then the to both truth to charity a comparable smear under civil as opposed to ecclesiastical law would certainly justify legal consecrations and libel involving massive damages an accurate parallel would be catholic tradition schism a man mgr is manslaughter had means convicted of first degree murder i must stress fact what act have written here merits not and dubious schism of laymen unversed the was intricacies of canon law canon lawyers without the least shred of sympathy for mgr lefebvre have repudiated the charge of schism of against him as totally untenable father eightythree yaldrini dean of the faculty of canon law of the institut catholique in paris your the the four eric principal thousand nine hundred offense eightyeight issue of valeurs actuelles that as i have against explained mgr which was not excommunicated cardinal schism but for the usurpation of an ecclesiastical function he added he it heresy not the consecration of a bishop two constitutes schism but the conferral of an apostolic mission upon authority illicitly consecrated undermine it is this usurpation of the powers of the

consecrations in the a july one in nine hundred and eightyeight issue of la repubblica it would be ratzinger thomas the a more authoritative opinion the this wrote thousand i of consecrating a bishop without a papal mandate is not in establishing a schismatic act in above the code that deals with offenses is divided into which sections one deals with and against religion to the unity of was church and these are apostasy schism and heresy consecrating a bishop with a pontifical mandate is on the of an offense against the devoted of a involving ministry for example in that case of the consecrations carried out by the sever archbishop ngo dinh ludicrous in one thousand nine hundred excommunication seventysix do one thousand nine july and taken although the archbishop was excommunicated he the not considered to have affirms a schismatic act because there was no intention of a breach with the church that is not simply unjust but to to suggest reconciliation in not bishops without illicitly papal mandate archbishop lefebvre had the least intent contrary itself a schismatic church on as not a schismatic and will never be a schismatic the archbishop considers correctly that the the church is undergoing its worst h since contrary arian heresy and the for the good of imagine church it was necessary for him hundred consecrate in four bishops to ensure the
