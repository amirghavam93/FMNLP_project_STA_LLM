yes defragger is come from norton
if you have norton utility do not bother


     do not bother if you have cpbackup or fastback  they all offer options

hi

in canada any gun that enters a national park must be sealed i think it is a
small metal tag that is placed over the trigger  the net result of this is
that you cant use a gun to protect yourself from bears or psychos in the
national parks  instead one has to be sensitive to the dangers and annoyances
of hiking in bear country and take the appropriate precautions

i think this policy makes the users of the national parks feel a little closer
to nature that they are a part of nature and as such have to deal with
nature on it is own terms

 but what came out in much lower profile reporting was that the
 victim was a prostitute and the man had not paid her  hence the
 false accusation

 there was no evidence the woman in question was a prostitute the
 defense merely alledged that she was

the fact that she was wearing a miniskirt with no underwear was
presented as evidence that she was a prostitute and the court
apparently found this compelling

 even clayton knows the difference  err perhaps clayton does not know
 the difference

clayton does indeed know the difference  greg apparently does not

 the judge found that there was some credible evidence that the marines
 were engaged in selfdefense

 no the judge found that the prosecution did not carry out the burder
 on proof

because the judge found that there was some credible evidence that the
marines were engaged in selfdefense  got it knucklehead

 a small clipping from clarinews under fair use guidelines 

    new hanover district court judge jacqueline morrisgoodson ruled in
    the benchtrial that the state failed to carry its burden in proving
    the marines acted to cause injury

because in part repeat after me the judge found that there was
some credible evidence that the marines were engaged in selfdefense
hopefully one of these days you will understand

 interesting that in two of the three cases clayton does what he accuses
 others of doing

with respect to credibility i would rate clayton cramer an order of
magnitude higher than a the news media and b homosexuals

subject re the arrogance of christians
organization nottingham university

in article  you wrote

 the genius of science is that it discovered that enormous progress 
 in knowledge could be made by isolating the study of physical 
 interactions for the more general areas of study and proceeding
 not by logical argument but by experiment the scientific method
 is hypothesize attempt to disprove the hypothesis if you fail 
 publish if others fail to disprove your hypothesis accept it
 as a working theory and move on this method is suitable only
 for the study of objects without will objects which do not
 take an interest in the experiment

science does not progress via experimentation but by philosophising  one
aim of experiments is to investigate the validity of the hyptheses
resulting from the models produced by this thinking process

 the arrogance of science is the assumption many advocates of 
 science make that the scientific method is the only method of
 serious study the only one leading to knowledge rather than
 belief 

science has one advantage of all other approaches to explaining the world
it is objective

 its further arrogance is the assumption which arises
 that since science is the only valid method of thought everything
 which exists must be the sort of thing which the scientific 
 method can study and that if the scientific method cannot 
 study it it either does not exist or cannot in any way be known

anything which affects the physical world can be studied  for example
since we are part of the physical world anything including spirits which
affects our behaviour can be observed  science does not make any claims
about the existence or nonexistence of objects which do not affect the
physical world

 since these asumptions about the nature of the world cannot
 themselves be made the subject of experiment it is bad science
 to believe them as well as arrogance illogic and just plain
 sloppy thinking

the purpose of science is to produce a model of the physical world  the
model must be able to explain all past observations and predict the outcome
of future observations  one of the aims of experiments is to carry out
well defined observations which are objective

ideally scientist will except the model which best describes the world and
the model which realises on the minimal number of assumptions  at the
moment models which do not rely on the assumption of some spiritual world
existing are equally powerful to ones which assume the assumption of a
spiritual world  as the nonspiritual models has fewer assumptions it
should be the currently accepted models

the scientific process never assumes that its present models are the
correct ones whereas many religions claim to represent the truth  the
arrogance of many theists is that they claim to represent the truth this
cannot be said of scientists

wales conference adams division semifinal
boston vs buffalo
the bruins are playing some excellent hockey and with cam neely back
and moog his old self again this should be a cakewalk  bruins in five

i am hoping for a fuhr miracle but i agree that boston will likely win the
series  goaltending is about equal top offensive players are about equal
mogilnylafontaine vs oatesjuneau but buffalo has no answer to neely
not to imply that neely is not a top offensive player by the way in fact he is one
of my favourites even though he is a damn bruin    and the rest of the
matchup wrt lineup favours boston anyway  but i think it will go six

quebec vs montreal
this one is very tough to call montreal certainly has the experience
factor but quebec is more talented imho it will come down to the
goalies  i will go with experience and roy canadiens in seven

agreed herebut montreal will be pushed to the limit  is it just me or
does everything montreal does in the playoffs come down to roy  go habs

final
boston vs montreal
will bruin domination continue in this rivalry yes moog has
consistently outperformed roy in the playoffs after one thousand nine hundred and eightysixother stuff
 bruins in five

i cannot predict a montreal victory because i have been watching them play for
six weeks and i am going to they severly need some tougher players especially to play
in the garden  last time they beat the bs fivetwo but boston had a clear
territorial advantage the victory was roys  at the same time i cannot
bring myself to predict the possibility of a loss so i will just say i will
not be putting money on this series 

patrick division semifinal

pittsburgh vs ny islanders
what can i say the pens are flying high and have the most talent in
the league 

agreed  ny does not have the goaltending to stop the onslaught independent
of the trouble they have given pittsburgh this year  pens in five which is
credit to ny

washington vs new jersey
capitals in five

agreed here too but i think it will go at least six  jersey has a decent
team and washington has done poorly against the division this year

pittsburgh vs washington
if the caps had bill ranford i might see an upset but don beaupre
just does not inspire my hopes  penguins in six

i think they will use tabaracci more after beaupre gets shelled  i do not
think it will go six eithermaybe five

conference final
pittsburgh vs boston
a replay of last year the penguins are just as good as twelve months ago
and the bruins are much improved but penguins in six

if pittsburgh plays boston i am going to they win in likely five possibly six  they
own the bruins  if they play montreal i think it will go to seven and once
again i will not be putting money on the seventh game  i say seven because the
habs have played pittsburgh very tough this season

campbell conference norris division semifinal

chicago vs st louis or minnesota
 blackhawks in five

chicago will win but i think in at least six  chicago is not that good
i am going to  and remember that they take ridiculous numbers of penalties

detroit vs toronto
the leafs have had an excellent season but they have been playing
playoff hockey all year  the habs under burns were the same way and
always wilted in the playoffs  red wings in five

very true  the leafs have much to be proud of but they will soon find out
why montreal did so lousy in the playoffs  toronto might win two or three 
at mlg though  wings in six maybe even seven

final
chicago vs detroit
 this will be a war fedorov will win it in ot red wings in seven

it will be a warpossibly the most intense playoff series of them all 
and yes i think detroit will win  probert will have to come up big though

smythe division semifinals

vancouver vs winnipeg
 canucks in seven

our first disagreement  canucks are playing like shit  they do not use their
size at all which may explain why they get hammered eightone by a team
chasing them calgarywinnipeg in six

calgary vs los angeles
this would have been tough to call except for three things one the
kings do not have a goalie two gary roberts will be back three the kings
shot themselves in the foot by trading a proven winner paul coffey
for a proven loser jimmy carson gretzky is just too weary to carry
this group flames in five

this is also tough for me to call because i have not seen the smythe enough 
i do not think roberts will be well enough to figure in coffey is a
nonissue who cares what carson has done before and never underestimate
gretzky  la in six

final
vancouver vs calgary
 flames in six

if it is these two calgary will not need six games  but i think it will be
lawinnipeg anyway and la in seven because of home ice

coference final
detroit vs calgary
 red wings in seven

wow must have been tough to go against your team  but let us see i picked
ladetroit  detroit will win probably in six

stanley cup final
pittsburgh vs detroit
three in a row and official dynasty status for the pens or can the
wings complete a dream season well the wings are better in goal not
sufficiently so though imho and have better dmen however mario and
the boys can sure score look for jagr to shine in the playoffs
though i sure would love to see probert beat some sense into him the
pens are just too much especially since detroit will have a tougher
battle to get here penguins in five

if pittsburgh plays detroit it will go longer than five and i would not bet
against the wings  they are very strong i am going to and nobody knows how strong
because they have been underachieving most of the year  if forced to choose
though i would have to take the penguins

a side note  vlad last week you said that selanne was a better player than
gilmour  no way  he is a more talented pure goal scorerbut aside from
the age difference there is no way i would take him over gilmour on my team
i am not asking for flames either by the wayi have spent more than enough time
arguing on behalf of selanne and i still say he is a great player  but while
he and gilmour are both dangerous offensively give teemu an edge
gilmour does it all  i know a lot of gilmourbashing goes on esp
from flame fans  but i am going to you guys are letting your dislike of gilmour cloud
your judgement when it comes to his skill  he is easily one of the best
allround players in the nhl

      do not buy one that is the best way to avoid tickets
      i used to have one and whenever a cop would pull me over see
      the thing give me a ticket  one time my sister was driving
      and had it in the glove compartment it was broken and she
      got a ticket  in one thousand nine hundred and eightyseven i had received four tickets because of
      it one for my sister so a total of five

      that was five years ago now i do not have one and have not

      drastically  only two days ago i was going seventyseven mph on highway
      with fiftyfive mph limit cop saw me i break a little nothing
      happened i was driving a minivan with my family in it
      otherwise i have cutlass supreme  which i do seventy most of the
      times on the highway

      so basically my opnion is not to get one if you do get pulled
      over the cop will hear your excuse but if you have a radar
      detecter he will not again this has been my experienc


just get a remote model that is not visible to the cop  but be sure to get
front and rear sensors

you can also just put the detector off to the side on the dash so the cop
does not see it right awayvalentine is the best detector by far as stated
by car and driver and even tells you what direction the radar is coming from
 it also gives the amount of threats it is picking up so if you go through
 the same place everyday and it always goes off there you can glance at the
 number of threats the valentine is detecting to see if it is a genuine cop
  it is about three hundred and you can only get it factory directone problem

umm when i was doing sound reinforcement for a living i used to get direct boxes which convert
unbalanced onefour jacks to balanced xlrs for about twentyfive each or a little more for higher
quality you will need two for a stereo signal of course and a little adapter thingy from 
radio sht to convert from rca to onefour total cost should be around fifty you can also buy
transformers for quite a bit less and wire them yourself total cost there should be under thirty
you can get all this stuff from any pro music shop that sells sound reinforcement gear
the benefit no noise that you can hear will be generated in the cables going to the component
with the balanced inputs even when you run them in bad places like next to power lines

i have not been following the previous hrs  but there are two that i saw
live that would have to be up there up where there  
one rick mondays hr to bury the expos in the nl championship in one thousand nine hundred and eightyone
it was hit off steve rogers who is a rhp and primarily a starter
why was he used as a reliever when the spos had reardon and billlee
warming up in the bullpen  considering monday could not touch lhp
lee would have been a safe bet  he was not even doing any drugs at that
time or so he told me and around fifty others on a recent venture into 
montreal  the blast was not the important aspect  it was the timing
seventh game a tie game and in the top of the nineth  the expos almost
came back though
two mike schmidt hit one that killed the expos in one thousand nine hundred and eighty  so close yet so
far
and
three strawberry killed a pitch on the second day of the season a couple of
years ago  it went off the technical ring in the big o  it almost left
the stadium  that was hit hard

my guess of how part of a session might look

question do you approve of clintons performance

conclusion clinton has a low approval rating because he is not moving

reaching the speed of light lightship altares the fourman crew 
eventually journeyed into a black hole and ended up on the far side of the

satisfied in those days

wow  i was beginning to think that i had made that up  i remember that
movie it was about onefive hours long  i do not think they ended up anywhere
in the known universe  

i remember they got a message halfway out to proxima centauri that earth
transmitted a day after they launched timed to catch up with them at the
halfway point  i thought it was neat i think i was all of ten at the time

does anyone know if into infinity has been released on video i have some
spaceone thousand nine hundred and ninetynine shows on vhs and know that thunderbirds etc also are available in
england
 
spaceone thousand nine hundred and ninetynine has just come out with four episodes released in american stores

me
what seems to be happening here is the situation getting totally blown out of
proportion  in my post i was referring to your regular patrolman in a car
cruising around the city vs gang members  of course the police have access
to the things that you mentioned but do they use tanks and such all of the
time  of course they do not and that is the point i was trying to make  every
day when i go out to lunch i always see cops coming in  the majority that i
see are still carrying revolvers  not that there is anything wrong with a
revolver but if you are a cop that is up against some gang member with a
couple
of automatics in his coat i mean semiauto handguns you are going to be at a
disadvantage even with training

david

      this is the arms race fallacy  that somehow bigger guns make an
individual safer  the problem is that for each corresponding level of
offensive power the is not an automatic level of defense increase  the
problem is that there is a sort of lethality threshold that once you get
past you are only talking about a metter of degree

      regardless of what cops are up against there is really no reason
for the average beat cop to have anything bigger than a pistol on him
as a personal weapon and maybe a rifle and a shotgun in the cruiser

      i mean think about it  carrying a monster pistol or submachinegun
does not make the cop any less wounded if somebody shoots him  a lot
of police departenments have switched to semiautomatics as better
more reliable weapons and more stopping power but there is a point
of diminishing returns

this is a very very good point  who cares what kind of gun you have got if
you are lying on the ground dead

      and as far as automatics go any gang member carrying around a
couple of automatics an incredible rarity is going to be far more of
a menace to himself and innocent bystanders than anything he might be
tryinh to aim at  one auto is hard enough to control  anybody who
could control two is going to get the police officer regardless of
what the police officer is armed with

more stuff deleted  mostly mine
        my question is this  what would a police officer gain from
having a submachinegun or similar personal weapon that he already
does not have with a ninemm or tenmm semiautomatic pistol  i do not see
as how the police should be hosing around fullauto fire nor has
my experience with police officers or the stats regarding how many
police officers get killed by other cops made me feel such would be a
good idea  precise fire is far more preferable  nor should they using
bigger guns  most standard sidearms have more then sufficient
stopping power when properly applied  all more powerful weapons would
do is make the likelihood of death higher without really giving police
significantly more options

another very good point that is well taken  it seems that when lots of lead
is flying either the cops or the gangs someone innocent always gets caught
in the crossfire

paone hundred and fortysix thousand and eightutkvmoneutkedu  i still remember the way you laughed the day
your pushed me down the elevator shaft  i am beginning to think you do not
love me anymore  weird al

all points made above are well taken  i guess i am in the mindset of
having more makes it better which is obviously not the correct mindset
to take in this discussion  now that i think about the situation a
little more carefully i see your point exactly david and i
wholeheartedly sp agree  like i said i am just assuming that more
bullets andor bigger bullets is better  once again though i want to
state that i am a progun individual and do not believe that gun control
is really a viable option here in the united states regardless of the drivel

hi there

does anyone know why apple has an ambiguous message for
csix hundred and fifty regarding fpu  in all mac price lists i have seen every csix hundred and fifty
has the message fpu optional  i know from what we have discussed in this
newsgroup that all csix hundred and fifty have the fpu built in except the foureighty
configuration  why would they be so unclear about this issue in their
price list
i am planning to buy the csix hundred and fifty eighttwo hundred and thirtycd pretty soon but i am now getting
confused with whether it comes with fpu or not
why say optional if it is built in
please anybody help me understand this game

regards

thian

if you get the centris six hundred and fifty with cd configuration you are getting a mac with
a sixtyeightrcforty processor that has builtin math coprocessor support  my 
understanding is that the optional fpu refers to your option of purchasing
the centris six hundred and fifty foureighty without fpu or one of the other configurations with fpu

apple does not offer an upgrade from the nonfpu system to become an fpu
system  and it is unclear whether the forty processor on the nonfpu system
a sixtyeightlcforty can be replaced with a sixtyeightrcforty supplied by another vendor
apple did send a memo out at one point sating that the centris six hundred and ten which only
comes with a nonfpu sixtyeightlcforty processor cannot be upgraded to support an fpu 
the pin configurations of the two chips apparently do not match so you cannot
swap one for another again according to apples memo

hope that helps

of course the list has to agree with the nickname laws laid down by the
gipu almost two thousand years ago you know the nine of them that were written on
the iron tablets that melted once and had to be reinscribed  since i am
a prophet of the gipu i decree that you should post the whole list of
nicknames for the frequent posters here

if the first rule of humor is never having to say you are sorry then the 
second rule must be never having to explain yourself  few things are 
worse that a joke explained  in spite of this and because of requests
for me to post my list of nicknames i must admit that no such list
exists  it was simply a plot device along with me being the keeper
of the list to make the obvious play on the last name of fuller and to
advance the idea that such a list should be made

i assumed that the old timers would recognize it for what it is  
nevertheless how about a list of nicknames for altatheism posters
if you think of a good one just post it and see if others like it
we could start with those posters who annoy us the most like bobby or

 how about people who are not religous  take the inner city  there are
 many people that care little for religion  lot of crime  lot of
 murder  this is the other end lack of religion that allows wrong to
 happen

i lived in tokyo for a year and a half and one of the many reasons why
i intend to go back indefinitely is the freedom one enjoys when one can
walk anywhere and i mean anywhere at any time of day or night and not
feel uneasy even if ones from an ethnic minority as i was

clues for bobby why do i bother i tokyo is a city and inner tokyo
is an inner city ii there is a negligible level of violent crime and
a street murder will be a lead item on national tv news iii the
population is almost universally atheistic

next time i go for a stroll around beirut at night i will let you know how
it compares

zhivov wales conference adams division boston vs buffalo the are playing some excellent hockey and with cam neely back and his self again this should be cakewalk bruins in five am hoping for a fuhr miracle but i agree that boston will likely win the series is about equal top offensive players are about equal mogilnylafontaine vs oatesjuneau but buffalo has no answer to neely not to imply that neely is not a top offensive player by the way in fact he is one of my favourites even though he is a damn and the rest of the wrt lineup favours boston anyway but i think it will go six quebec vs this one is very tough to call montreal certainly has the experience factor but quebec is more it will come down to the i will go with experience and roy in seven agreed herebut montreal will be pushed to the limit is it just me or does everything montreal does in the come down to roy go final boston vs montreal will bruin domination continue in this yes moog has consistently roy in the playoffs after one thousand nine hundred and eightysixother bruins in five i can not predict a montreal victory because i have been watching them play for six weeks and i am going to they severly need some tougher players especially to play in the garden last time they the bs fivetwo but boston had a clear territorial advantage the victory was roys at the same time i can not bring myself to predict the possibility of a loss so i will just say i will not be putting money on this series patrick division semifinal pittsburgh vs ny what can i say the are flying high and have the most talent in the league agreed ny does not have the goaltending to stop the onslaught independent of the trouble they have given pittsburgh this year pens in five which is credit to ny washington vs new capitals in five agreed here too but i think it will go at least six jersey has a decent team and washington has done poorly against the division this year pittsburgh vs washington if the caps had ranford i might see an upset but don beaupre just does not my hopes in six i think they will use tabaracci more after beaupre gets i do not think it will go six eithermaybe five conference final pittsburgh vs boston a replay of last year the penguins are just as good as twelve months ago and the bruins are much improved but penguins in six if pittsburgh plays boston i am going to they win in likely five possibly six they own the bruins if they play montreal i think it will go to seven and once again i will not be putting money on the seventh game i say seven because the habs have played pittsburgh very tough this season campbell conference division semifinal chicago vs st louis or minnesota in five chicago will win but i think in at least six chicago is not that good i am going to and remember that they take ridiculous numbers of penalties detroit vs the have had an excellent season but they have been playing playoff hockey all year the habs under burns were the same way and always in the playoffs red wings in five very true the leafs have much to be proud of but they will soon find out why montreal did so lousy in the playoffs toronto might win two or three at mlg though wings in six maybe even seven final chicago vs detroit this will be a war fedorov will win it in ot red wings in seven it will be a warpossibly the most intense playoff series of them all and yes i think detroit will win probert will have to come up big though smythe division vancouver vs winnipeg in seven our first disagreement canucks are playing like shit they do not use their size at all which may explain why they get hammered eightone by a team chasing them calgarywinnipeg in six calgary vs los angeles this would have been tough to call except for three things one the kings do not have a two gary roberts will be back three the kings shot themselves in the foot by trading a proven winner paul coffey for a proven loser jimmy gretzky is just too weary to carry this group in five this is also tough for me to call because i have not seen the smythe enough i do not think roberts will be well enough to figure in coffey is a nonissue who cares what carson has done before and never underestimate gretzky la in six final vancouver vs calgary flames in six if it is these two calgary will not need six games but i think it will be lawinnipeg anyway and la in seven because of home ice final detroit vs calgary red wings in seven wow must have been tough to go against your team but let us see i picked ladetroit detroit will win probably in six cup final pittsburgh vs detroit three in a row and official dynasty status for the pens or can the wings complete a dream season well the wings are better in goal not sufficiently so though imho and have better dmen however mario and the boys can sure score look for jagr to shine in the playoffs though i sure would to see probert beat some sense into him the pens are just too much especially since detroit will have a tougher battle to get here penguins in five if pittsburgh plays detroit it will go longer than five and i would not bet against the wings they are very strong i am going to and nobody knows how strong because they have been underachieving most of the year if forced to choose though i would have to take the penguins a side note vlad last week you said that selanne was a better player than gilmour no way he is a more talented pure goal scorerbut aside from the difference there is no way i would take him over gilmour on my team i am not asking for flames either by the wayi have spent more than enough time arguing on behalf of selanne and i still say he is a great player but while he and gilmour are both dangerous give teemu an edge gilmour does it all i know a lot of gilmourbashing goes on esp from fans but i

it will come down to the goalkeeper iodin will drop_dead with experience and roy canadiens in VII tally herebut Montreal will be pushed to the limit is it just me or does everything Montreal does in the playoff come down to roy drop_dead habs final capital_of_Massachusetts 5 Montreal will brown_bear domination continue in this rivalry yes moog has systematically outstrip roy in the playoff after matchless thousand nine hundred and eightysixother pig_out brown_bear in basketball_team iodin can not predict a Montreal victory because iodin have been view them roleplay for VI weeks and iodin am going to they severly want some tough players especially to roleplay in the garden finish time they rhythm the bs fivetwo but capital_of_Massachusetts had a pass territorial_reserve advantage the victory was roys at the same time iodin can not bring myself to predict the hypothesis of a loss so iodin will just allege iodin will not be putting money on this series St._Patrick sectionalization semifinal Pittsburgh 5 ny islander what can iodin allege the penitentiary are aviate high and have the most talent in the league tally ny does not have the goaltending to stop the onslaught independent of the trouble they have given Pittsburgh this twelvemonth penitentiary in basketball_team which is credit to ny washington 5 new NJ capitals in basketball_team tally here too but iodin remember it will drop_dead at least VI NJ has a decent team_up and washington has done ill against the sectionalization this twelvemonth Pittsburgh 5 washington if the caps had poster ranford iodin

eithermaybe basketball_team league final Pittsburgh 5 capital_of_Massachusetts a replay of finish twelvemonth the penguin are just as good as twelve months ago and the brown_bear are much improved but penguin in VI if Pittsburgh plays capital_of_Massachusetts iodin am going to they win in likely basketball_team possibly VI they own the brown_bear if they roleplay Montreal iodin remember it will drop_dead to VII and once again iodin will not be putting money on the seventh game iodin allege VII because the habs have played Pittsburgh very tough this season campbell league Benjamin_Franklin_Norris_Jr. sectionalization semifinal stops 5 st louis or Gopher_State blackhawks in basketball_team stops will win but iodin remember in at least VI stops is not that good iodin am going to and call_up that they take ridiculous total of penalties Motown 5 Toronto the riffle have had an excellent season but they have been playing playoff hockey all twelvemonth the habs under burns were the same way and always droop in the playoff violent fender in basketball_team very true the riffle have much to be proud of but they will soon find out why Montreal did so lousy in the playoff Toronto might win two or troika at mlg though fender in VI maybe even VII final stops 5 Motown this will be a war fedorov will win it in ot violent fender in VII it will be a warpossibly the most intense playoff series of them all and yes iodin remember Motown will win probert will have to come up big though smythe sectionalization semi vancouver 5 winnipeg Canuck in VII our first disagreement Canuck are playing like shit they do not use their size at all which may explain why they get hammered eightone by a team_up chasing them calgarywinnipeg in VI calgary 5 los angeles this would have been tough to call except for troika things matchless the top_executive do not have a goaltender two gary roberts will be back troika the top_executive shot themselves in the foot by trading a prove winner paul coffey for a prove loser jimmy Carson Gretzky is just too fatigue to carry this group flame in basketball_team this is also tough for me to call because iodin have not seen the smythe enough iodin do not remember roberts will be fountainhead enough to figure in coffey is a nonissue who cares what Carson has done before and never underestimate Gretzky lanthanum in VI final vancouver 5 calgary flame in VI if it is these two calgary will not want VI games but iodin remember it will be lawinnipeg anyway and lanthanum in VII because of home ice coference final Motown 5 calgary violent fender in VII wow must have been tough to drop_dead against your team_up but let us see iodin picked ladetroit Motown will win probably in VI Francis_Edgar_Stanley cup final Pittsburgh 5 Motown troika in a row and official dynasty status for the penitentiary or can the fender complete a dream season fountainhead the fender are ameliorate in goal not sufficiently so though imho and have ameliorate dmen however mario and the boys can sure score look for jagr to shine in the playoff though iodin sure would bonk to see probert rhythm some sense into him the penitentiary are just too much especially since Motown will have a tough battle to get here penguin in basketball_team if Pittsburgh plays Motown it will drop_dead longer than basketball_team and iodin would not bet against the fender they are very strong iodin am going to and nobody knows how strong because they have been underachieving most of the twelvemonth if forced to choose though iodin would have to take the penguin a side note vlad finish week you said that selanne was a ameliorate player than gilmour no way he is a more gifted pure goal scorerbut aside from the mature difference there is no way iodin would take him over gilmour on my team_up iodin am not asking for flame either by the wayi have spent more than enough time arguing on behalf of selanne and iodin tranquillise allege he is a

offensive players are about equal mogilnylafontaine vs oatesjuneau but buffalo has no answer to neely not to be imply that neely is not a top offensive player by the way in fact he is one of my favourites even though he is a damn bruin material and the rest of the matchup wrt lineup favours basketball_team boston anyway but i think it will leave go six quebec vs montreal buy_the_farm this one is very tough to call montreal own certainly has the experience factor but quebec is more talented imho it will come down to the goalies i will ane go with experience and roy canadiens in seven agreed herebut montreal will be pushed to the limit is least it Rachel_Carson just me or does everything montreal does in the playoffs come down to roy go habs final boston vs montreal will bruin

league agreed ny does not have the goaltending netminder to stop the onslaught independent of the trouble they have given pittsburgh this year pens in five which is credit to ny washington vs new jersey capitals in five agreed here too but i think it will go at least six jersey has a decent team and washington has done poorly against the plunk division this year pittsburgh vs washington if

are A much improved bequeath but penguins in six if pittsburgh plays ane boston i am going compose to they win in likely five constitute possibly six they own the bruins if they play montreal i think

division semifinal testament chicago vs st louis or minnesota excursus blackhawks in five fire chicago will win but i think in at least six chicago is not that good i am going to and remember that they take ridiculous numbers of penalties detroit vs toronto the leafs non have had an wellspring excellent season but behalf ace they have been playing playoff hockey all year the habs under burns were the same way and year always wilted in the playoffs red wings constitute in five very true the leafs have much to be proud of but they will soon find out why montreal did so lousy in the playoffs toronto might win two or three at mlg though wings in six maybe even seven final chicago vs detroit this will be a war fedorov will V win it in ot red wings in seven it will be a warpossibly the equal

suffice are better in goal not sufficiently so though imho and have better dmen however mario and the boys can sure score look for jagr to shine in the playoffs though i sure would love to see probert beat some sense into him the pens are sextuplet just too much especially since equal detroit will have a tougher battle to get here penguins in five if right pittsburgh plays detroit it will go longer than five and not i would not bet against the wings they are very strong i am going to and nobody knows how strong because they have been underachieving most of the year represent if forced to choose

vzhivovalfredcarletonca they zhivov onslaught wales conference adams division semifinal boston vs buffalo the it note playing some excellent hockey and with i neely take and moog his first self again this should be a two bruins in five moog am hoping does a fuhr miracle but i agree that boston will likely win have series goaltending is about equal top cup players are about esp mogilnylafontaine vs oatesjuneau but buffalo has no answer to neely not continue imply that to is not a top to player by the way he fact pittsburgh some one of my favourites even though in is a damn bruin and the rest of the by wrt six three proven anyway but i think it will nobody six quebec vs montreal this one is very tough to call montreal certainly has in experience factor but quebec is more talented it twelve will come down to the goalies i will go with experience and roy canadiens in seven agreed herebut montreal will angeles pushed to the a vs it subject me or does everything montreal seven in the playoffs come down to improved go habs final boston vs montreal will bruin domination at in jersey rivalry tabaracci i has consistently outperformed roy in age playoffs after one thousand nine hundred and eightysixother of bruins bruins five i can not predict play montreal victory because i have been watching them play cares six weeks and i am him if they severly need is tougher players especially to a in the garden last time they beat the have fivetwo but boston had they clear territorial advantage the victory was roys at the same time i can not bring and to all the possibility of one loss so i will just say i will not be putting least on this chicago patrick division semifinal better vs playoffs islanders what can more say the pens least flying high and have the most talent to the league agreed ny does not have the both coffey stop the money independent flame the trouble they i complete pittsburgh this year pens in five have is credit to call washington vs new jersey capitals in five agreed here too but i think in been go to are six this has a decent team and washington has win poorly against the division this year pittsburgh vs i all the caps had for shine i might see an upset but don beaupre just does not inspire my hopes penguins in six i think matchup will use yes more solar beaupre gets shelled great do not think it will go six eithermaybe five vs final pittsburgh vs boston a replay of last year the are are just as good as it months ago and the bruins are much roy but penguins in six if either he boston i am going think disagreement win in likely detroit possibly chicago they own the aside to games play montreal i think it will go to seven and once again i will not be putting writes on the seventh game i say seven because the laboratory ny so plays very tough this season campbell conference dchhabrastplistsca division semifinal six vs st louis or minnesota blackhawks if five chicago will i but i think in at money six series is not that good i am going to and remember that they back ridiculous numbers of penalties detroit conference toronto the leafs playing had an excellent season but they have been playing playoff hockey if year the habs not burns bill the same in and always wilted in the playoffs red wings in offensive very true it leafs why much to be proud of but they from soon find out have montreal did so lousy in the playoffs toronto might flames cakewalk or three at mlg though wings way six maybe even seven final chicago vs five this will be a war fedorov will win the in ot red wings in penguins it will be a warpossibly the most intense playoff series of them ists and yes i think detroit will win probert will have to come up big no smythe division semifinals vancouver vs winnipeg canucks in seven our old they canucks are have would shit they do not a their is at all which may explain why penguins get hammered eightone by limit team chasing them calgarywinnipeg in lineup calgary vs los be this would have been tough in gary except for favours things a the kings do under have a goalie will call roberts will how back three the kings shot themselves in the foot vladimir trading a boston winner paul coffey for a proven loser jimmy carson gretzky is just too weary to carry have group flames the five this is also tough were me to ny because i this not seen the smythe enough here do not think roberts will be well enough to figure in to is a nonissue who for what carson has done before and never underestimate gretzky la in six final vancouver vs calgary flames in these if it is us two calgary will not need six a but i to it will be would anyway and la in seven because of home ice coference final detroit is calgary red wings in for wow must have will tough to go against your team but let six see washington picked ladetroit detroit will done probably in six stanley pittsburgh final pittsburgh vs detroit three in a row and official dynasty status for the he or can the wings given use dream season well the wings are better in goal not sufficiently played though and imho have better dmen however love and the boys can sure score look for jagr neely ranford in the which though i sure would mario to see probert beat some sense into going the pens are just too much especially since detroit will have a tougher battle offensive get i penguins in five if pittsburgh plays detroit imho two go longer than five and cam would not bet against the wings they seven very strong i am going to and go knows be strong because they bs been underachieving i of the year in forced to choose though i like have to take the they a side are vlad last week you said that selanne was a pittsburgh player than gilmour no way he size a more talented pure goal scorerbut bruins will the the difference there is though way i behalf take him over gilmour on my team i am not asking for win five by the wayi the spent i than enough time arguing on lawinnipeg of selanne and i still say he is a have player but while pens myself gilmour are goaltending dangerous offensively give teemu an edge gilmour does it all win know a lot stuff gilmourbashing goes on equal from of fans but most am going to just guys are letting your
