i would be willing to go in as well by the way we would not need to
buy the network wholesale simply owning a large number of shares
would still work if five of the shareholders want progun coverage
and the rest do not really care they will go along just to keep 
the five happy

i would go along with this plan as well  turners stock is traded
on the american exchange and has three classes a b and c  a and
b stock is currently about twentythree bucks a share c stock is about eleven
bucks a share  does anybody have any idea how much stock tbs
has issued  what would it take to reach five fiftyone or even one hundred

um i sortof hesitate to bring this up but owning even a single share
entitles you to attend the annual shareholders meeting and under most
corporate charters to introduce topics to be discussed  while i do not
suggest the tactic used by some in japan go to the shareholders meeting
and disrupt the bejeezus out of everything what about a wellworded

this issue has been going on for a while and your presentation here of
just one reference probably will not resolve this issue to those that
oppose your insistence that mosques were destroyed even in your
location of this one reference you spend most of your quote dealing
with an incidence that while abhorrant has nothing to do with the 
issue at hand here then at the end of the quote there is an almost
offhand comment that two mosques were destroyed

to support a claim of this nature what other authors support this
incident if identifiable mosques were destroyed they are certainly
identifiable they have names and addresses steet location the
comment by one reporter does make us wonder if this happened but
by no means proves it

there is no doubt that israeli authorities ordered the destruction of
mosques in the vicinity of the wailing wall that does not mean
however that once can generalize from this to any other points  the
entire plaza mosques and all was cleared to make it possible for jews
to have a place to worship in the place that was holiest to many of
them and which had been denied to them for millenia

on the other hand throughout the rest of jerusalem and israel to the
best of my knowledge israeli authorities have scrupulously avoided
damage to any islamic religious sites this contrasts with the policies
of previous regimes which destroyed jewish synagogues out of hate and
bigotry

   of course they are working on the theory that candida
 overbloom with penetration into mucus membrane tissue with

 in a large number of people  if you reject this yeast 
 hypothesis then i would guess you would view this research as one
 more wasteful and quixotic endeavor  stay tuned

i do not have enough medical expertise to have much of an opinion
one way or another on hidden candida infections  i can
understand the skepticism of those who see this associated with
various general kinds of symptoms while there is a lack of solid
demonstration that this happens and causes such general symptoms
to understand this skepticism one only needs to know of past
failures that shared these characteristics with the notion of
hidden candida infection  there have been quite a few and the
proponents of all thought that the skeptics were overly skeptical

on the other hand i am happy to read that some people are
sufficiently interested in this possibility spurred by
suggestive clinical experience to research it further  the
doubters may be surprised  it has happened before

i realize that admitting ignorance in the face of ignorance may
not endear me to those who are so sure they know one way or
another  and indeed perhaps some of them do know  i am the
one who is currently ignorant  but i find this the most honest

 only hear himself speaking in his own language

this thread si starting to get really silly such nonsense do not
belong in src and it really hurts me to read some of the posts on
this issue

we chose to believe whetever we want but we are not allowed to define
our own christianity we see in parts if you see something that i do
not see or vice versa it does not give me the right to play jokes on
your belief

there is no wonder that your miracle does not work you designet it
yourself and even if you were able to collect a group of people like
the one you describe i see no reason why your miracle should really
happen god is the one who does miracles not humans

after all we are all on the same way or at least we are all headed
for the same goal following different paths remember that we are
going to spend eternity together if i can not stand your view here on
earth how can i possibly stand spending eternity together with you

tongues is a question of belief not wether you believe in jesus but
if you believe that he is able to give you this gift just as any
other of the gifts mentioned in the bible but there is no evidence in
the bible that people who do not accept these gifts are in any way
better than others

 perhaps i would believe the gifted ones more if they were
 glorifying god rather than themselves then perhaps we would
 witness a real miracle

maybe some of the people who have received spiritual gifts are more
interested in glorifying themselves than glorifying god i do not know
but if this is the case it still does not suggest that the gifts are
faked

in the bible you will find that jesus did not always do miracles he
said that i do nothing except what my father tells me perhaps it
woulkd be for the best of all if we where all able to live by that
example

result that human beings are not held responsible for their own
actions  i will answer how you deal with this in a minute

   the catholic doctrine of predestination does not exclude free will in
any way  since god knows everything he therefore knows everything that
is going to happen to us  we have free will and are able to change
what happens to us  however since god knows everything he knows all
the choices we will make in advance god is not subject to time  too
often arguments pit predestination against free will  we believe in

lines ninetyone
nntppostinghost vmsocomokstateedu
organization osu college of osteopathic medicine

in article  ashwinagatechedu ashwin ram writes
 our twentymonth son has started falling sick quite often every since he
 started going to day care  he was at home for the first year and he did
 not fall sick even once  now it seems like he has some sort of cold or
 flu pretty much once a month  most of the time the cold leads to an ear
 infection as well with the result that he ends up being on antibiotics
 three weeks out of four  i know kids in day care fall sick more often but we
 are beginning to wonder how often more often really is whether our
 son is more susceptible or has lower immunity than average 
 are there any studies that can help answer some of these questions

when kids stayed in the home until kindergarden or onest grade infection 
incidence was much lower because exposure was lower  some studies suggest 
that early exposure to various infectious diseases is probably beneficial 
because exposure as an adult carries much more risk of morbitity and 
mortalitymumps measles etc

  how often do kids in their first second and third years fall sick
 how often do they get colds flus ear infections  is there any data on
 home care vs day care

daycare will always carry a higher exposure risk than home care

  does being sick build immunity leading to less illness later
 does it make kids weaker leading to more illness later or does it
 not have any long term effect

exposure to infectious organisms does build immunity  but many viruses 
mutate and reexposure to the new strain requires another immune response
new antibody production  in addition antibody levels tend to decline 
with time and reinnoculation is needed to keep the antibody levels high
chronic overstimulation of the immune response can lead to immunosupression 
but this is rare and very unlikely to occur in children

  does taking antibiotics on a regular basis have any negative long
 term effects

yes chronic use of antibiotics can have an adverse effect on the good 
bacteria that are supposed to be present in and on the body  health effects 
of this depletion of the good bacteria is a very hotly debated topic in the 
medical community with most physicians seeming to discount any health effects 
of chronic antibiotic use a view that i do not support
 
  how does one tell if a child is more susceptible to illness than
 normal and what does one do about it

chronic infection in an adult or a child needs to be worked up in my 
opinion  but most physicians feel that chronic infection in a child is 
normal because of both exposure and lack of prior immunity to many 
infectious diseases  i do not share this view and there are some 
physicians who also suspect that diet plays a big role in infection 
frequency and severity  exposure to an infectious agent does not have to 
result in a severe infection  a strong immune response can minimize the 
length of time needed to deal with the infection as well as the symptoms 
associated with the infection

  is there any way to build immunity and resistance

there are five major nutrients that are responsible for a good strong 
immune response to infectious agents  they are protein vitamin c 
vitamin a iron and zinc  the american diet is not low in protein so this 
is rarely a problem  but vitamin a vitamin c iron and zinc are often low 
and this lack of an adequate poolnutrient reserve can impair the immune 
response  iron is know to be low in most kidsas is vitamin a  there are 
distinct biochemical tests that can be run to check the status of each of 
these nutrients in a patient who is having a problem with chronic severe 
infection  serum ferritin for iron status dark adaptation for vitamin a 
status red blood cell zinc for zinc status and leckocyte ascorbate for 
vitamin c status  i have attempted to work up posts on these five 
nutrients and their role in infection for this news group as well as the 
others that i participate in  i can email you what i have worked up so far
but my best advice to you is to try to find a physician who recognizes the 
critical role that diet plays in the human immune response  you may also 
be able to get help from a nutritionist  anyone can call themselves a 
nutritionist so you have to be very carefull  you want to find someone
like myself who has had some formal training and education in nutrition
many phd programs in the yous now offer degrees in nutrition and that is 
what you need to look for  some dieticians will also call themselves 
nutritionists but most dieticians have not had the biochemical training 
needed to run specialized nutritional assessment tests  they are very good 
for getting general dietary advice from however

 any data information or advice relating to this would be much
 appreciated  thanks a lot

against the greeks during the period of time greece was occupied by the
turks  now you expect that turks living in greece should be treated like

so the greek educational system is also in a shambles history shows 
that within the last one hundred and seventy years greeks played that game twice they 
used istanbul patriarch grigorios in one thousand eight hundred and twentytwo to instigate the morea 
rebellion that resulted in the massacres of the muslim people again 
the orthodox patriarch constantine v invited the russian czar nicholas

  the disintegration of the ottoman empire which had been going on
  for a century was disastrous for ottoman jewry this was the age of
  nationalism among the christian subjects of the sultan starting with
  the greek revolution early in the nineteenth century which based on
  the megali idea or great idea sought to add to greek kingdom istanbul
  and large portions of anatolia union of which with greece was felt to be
  the dream and hope of all the success of the greek national movement
  provided more in fact by the intervention of the great powers than by the
  efforts of the greeks themselves stimulated similar uprisings among the
  other subjects in southeastern europe who had long been oppressed not so
  much by the ottomans but rather by the greek religious hierarchy which
  dominated the orthodox millet leading first to pressure for religious
  independence granted to the bulgarian orthodox exarchate in one thousand eight hundred and seventy to the
  serbian church in one thousand eight hundred and seventynine and to the rumanian church in one thousand eight hundred and eightyfive with subsequent
  aspirations for and achievement of political independence following

  page one hundred and eightyeight

  they new nationalist leaders were greatly assisted in their
   campaigns against the ottomans both by the diplomatic and consular
   representatives of the major powers of europe and also by christian
   missionaries who emphasized feelings of christian superiority and
   hatred for muslims and jews which fortified the religious as well as
   ethnic bases of their pursuit of independence

   christian nationalism based as much on religious as on ethnic identity
   soon resurrected the medieval bigotries which had devastated both jews
   and muslims and consequently had driven them together in the past
   vicious antimuslim and antisemitic movements developed involving
   largescale persecutions and massacres carried out by invading armies
   by the independent states that resulted also by christian subjects
   who remained within the empire particularly because of jewish and muslim
   support for ottoman integrity in fear of their fate in the emergent
   nationalist states of southeastern europe the results were explosive
   and damaging

   the invading armies of russia and austria as well as the revolting
   nationalists and later successfully established independent christian
   states committed systematic genocide against jews and muslims throughout
   the nineteenth century despite great power admonitions to the contrary
   in the treaties of paris one thousand eight hundred and fiftyeight and berlin one thousand eight hundred and seventyeight

  page one hundred and eightyeight

  as the peoples of southeastern europe achieved their independence
   their muslim and jewish minorities were systematically persecuted and
   massacred and those who survived were driven beyond the evershrinking
   boundaries of the retreating ottoman empire in a kind of slaughter which
   had not been seen since the dispersal of the jews from palestine centuries
   earlier

   this sort of genocide had begun as long before as the late sixteenth
   century with the rumanian principalities taking the lead as united
   rumania did subsequently during the later years of the nineteenth
   century in one thousand five hundred and seventynine the ruler of moldavia peter the lame banished its
   jews because of their competition with its christian merchants when
   prince micheal the brave revolted against the ottomans in the rumanian
   principalities of wallachia and moldavia in one thousand five hundred and ninetythree he ordered the massacre
   of all the jews as well as turks in bucharest

recently i have come upon a body of literature which promotes colon
cleansing as a vital aid to preventive medicine through nutrition  in
particular dr bernard jenssen in his book colon cleansing for
health and longevity  the title actually escapes me but it is very
similar to that  claims that regular selfadministered colonics
along with certain orally ingested debrisloosening agents boosts
the immune system to a significant degree

he also plugs a unique appliance called the colema board which
facilitates the selfadministration of colonics  it sells for over
one hundred from a californiabased company  he also plugs vitratox
products as his chemical agents of choice these include volcanic ash
supposedly for its electrical charge and psyllium powder for its
bulkiness

if anyone knows anything about colon cleansing theory its
particulars or the colema board and related products i would be very
interested to hear about research and personal experience

i am curious to know if christians ever read books based on critique
on the religion classical text such as age of reason by paine
or the myth maker by jacobi sometimes it is good to know your
enemy and if you want to do serious research you have to understand
both sides and not solely the one and only right one

yes one does  i examined a critique of the book of romans by
i think benjamin franklin once a deist  i found it amazing that
benjamin franklin missed the whole boat   i also have the writings
on thomas jefferson sitting on my shelf and it is amazing how
much he missed  i have studied platos theory of forms and 
aristotelian hylomorphesism  what a pile of junk  jesus
makes plato and aristotle look like kindergardeners  psychology
the id ego superego by freud  elements of truth but jesus
explained it far better and gave reasons

thomas paine benjamin franklin thomas jefferson are mere men  they
can screw up the bible just as well as any man  i do not put these
men on a pedestal  and if i remember tjs autobiography correctly
he thought thomas paine was the most unread man he ever met

here is some more circular reasoning to you  paul says to the corinthians
that that the gospel will be foolishness to the world because it is 
spiritually discerned  and so people without the spirit of god have not a
clue to what the bible is saying   from your point of view that is
incredibly circular and convenient   to me it is mysteriously and supernaturally
bizarre   i can see it but you cannot  this is not arrogance on
my part  trust me  it is as bizarre to you as it is to me  but nonetheless
it is a truth explainable or not

are any of you color blind to red and green  i am  remember those
dot tests they do at the optomologists  they put pictures in front
of you and you are supposed to identify the pattern in the dots  if
your eyes are perfectly normal you can see letters or numerals
embedded in the dots  they are a slightly different color and stand
out from the background  but if you are color blind to red and green
you will not see anything but grayshaded dots  that is how a dot
test appears to me  i do not see a pattern at all

a normal seeing person will see the patterns  and to him i seem like a
total anomaly  to him i appear as if i am missing the universe or something
it is hard for him to understand why i cannot see anything
that to him is as plain as day

that it what it is like with the bible the word of god to the believer
the believer can see the meaning in the words  i can see how the patterns
fit together  there is such depth  such consistency   but then on the
other hand i notice the nonbeliever   he does not see it  he thinks
i am weird because he thinks i am seeing things   i look at him and
say no you are weird  you do not see   then it is time for a sanity
check  i go to another christian and say do you see this  and
they go yes  it is an x  and i say thank god i see the x
too

it is truly the strangest thing   it adds a little extra dimension to
the phrase 

         he will make the blind see and the deaf hear

could see what they are missing

 bbc world news service on shortwave originating out of london
 reports that a survivor of the waco massacre states that a tank when
 making a hole in the wall of the building knocked over a kerosene
 lamp and that is how the fire started  attempts were made by the
 people inside to put out the fire but it spread too quickly
 
 we are hearing it  it sure rings true it is consistent in a way that
 mass suicide by fire is not  this survivor is also saying that they
  
 it rings true
 
 there was a separate report that an overhead helicopter which was recording
 the entire incident on video tape has a visual record of several files
 i think the number three was mentioned starting at different parts of the
 compound

has this video been made public  the fbi spokesman also said they 
first knew of the fire when black smoke started pouring out but
later said that three different fbi agents saw bd members starting
the fires

also the fbi claims to have listening devices bugs in the compound  
will they make public the tapes of what the bd said

 to me this attempt to blame the fbi for starting the fire simply looks
 like an attempt by a survivor to shift blame away from the bds
 
 i think it is a crock

well sealing the initial search warrent keeping the media miles away
not letting the bd talk to the public making contradictory statements
not releasing the vidio  tapes are not steps to ensure public confidence 
in their actions

all our local experts say it is the tappits that need some adjusting so
i am soon to attempt that  i would like any advice anyone had 

if this is the same as adjusting the shims between cam and valve i have
the same question  do you buy a full set of shims before starting the
adjustment process or do you calculate the shims you need and then run
off to the dealer in the cage to see if the right shims are in stock 
obviously the latter would be cheaper what do shims cost but are
measurements of the shim need reliable enough to buy only the indicated shims

much deleted 
point today might be the masons  just a note that they too worshipped 
osiris in egypt
much deleted 

     it bugs me when i see this kind of nonsense

     first there is no reasonable evidence linking masonry to ancient
egypt or even that it existed prior to the late fourteenth century and
there is nothing definitive before the seventeenth

i am going to cut rexs ramblings down a bit


you must not be past your twentyth level  you should read wilkinsons
egyptians and how he shows this egyptian religion paralleling his own british
masonry  there is a man here at this laboratory who is a thirtythree degree black
mason  i have talked with him 
there is the public side with motorcyle mania and
childrens hospitals and then there is the priviate side that only the highest
degree mason every learns of

   rex there are literally hundreds of thousands of thirtytwond degree
masons in this country and thousands of thirtythreerds if nasty stuff was
really going on do not you think you would have more than a couple of
disgruntled members exposing it heck if what you say is true then
rev norman vincent peale is an osiris worshiper
 

long quote from someone named hislop source not given deleted i am
attempting to extract from it the relevent points 

   osiris is actually nimrod a babylonian deity 

   it is admitted that the secret system of free masonry was originally
    founded on the mysteries of the egyptian isis the goddessmother or
    wife of osiris

   the babylonian nimrod and osiris are both connected with the building
    trade ie with masonry

   nimrod as the son of cush was a negro is not this refering to a 
    biblical nimrod rather than the babylonian god

    there was a tradition in egypt recorded by plutarch that osiris
     was black


     there is a long tradition in masonry of claiming ancient lineage
for the order on the flimsiest of grounds this dates right back to
the constitutions of one thousand seven hundred and thirtyeight which cite adam as the first mason i have
seen other claims which place masonry among the romans greeks and
egyptians and atlanteans i even have a book which claims to prove
that stonehenge was originally a masonic temple 

    claims prove nothing where is the beef rex

claims exmason showed him leopard skin he wore in lodge
 any representation of osiris usually show the wearing of some leopard

   i would have to check this the tomb paintings i remember do not show
this

  it is interesting that the druids of britian also show or should i say
 hide this representation  they however worshipped the spotted cow

   can you give ancient citations for this the druids were suppressed
over two thousand years ago what is your point

   this whole leopard skin business sounds bizarre  i have not yet
gone through the scottish rite which contains all of those higher
degrees antimasons get so excited about and which was invented in
the one thousand seven hundred and fiftys but i know enough people who have and who are good
christians that i reject your claim

i will stand by my statements  masonry is of the mystery religions
that all find their source in babylon the great harlot sorry peter
i do not mean to be a cold slap to the face but there is to much

not so much a slap in the face as a weary feeling of deja vu i am
going through a very similar argument over on soccultureafricanamerican

evidence to the contrary that masonry does not find its origins in
egypt  of the masons i have personally talked to all refered to
egypt as their origin  

    why do not you try reading some serious books on masonic history such
as hamills the craft

why are you now separating yourself from this which not many years ago
was freely admitted

   because we got honest if you can come up with actual evidence that
masonry existed prior to one thousand three hundred and ninety i would be very impressed actually
anything earlier than one thousand six hundred and thirty would be pretty good

   why does a lead acid battery discharge and become dead totally unuseable
 when stored on a concrete floor  

it could be that you stored it somewhere that it could become covered
by moisture or damp air which would short out the terminals

the same thing happens to my car citroen twocv  damp gets under the
bonnet us hood and shorts the sparkplugs to earth so it will not start

the solution for the car is to clean the plug leads and spray with
wdforty moisture repellant  if damp is the problem then storing the 
battery off the ground may help  i am not sure if spraying with wdforty
would be safe since it is very flammable high percentage petroleum

  from crossbows to cryptography  thwarting the state via
                     technology

  given at the future of freedom conference november one thousand nine hundred and eightyseven


     you   know   technologyand   particularly   computer
technologyhas often gotten a bad rap in  libertarian  cir
cles  we tend to think of orwells one thousand nine hundred and eightyfour or terry gilliams
brazil  or  the  proximity  detectors keeping east berlins
slavecitizens on their own side of the border or  the  so
phisticated  bugging  devices  nixon used to harass those on
his enemies list  or we recognize that for the price  of
a  ticket  on  the concorde we can fly at twice the speed of
sound but only if we first walk thru a magnetometer run  by
a  government  policeman and permit him to paw thru our be
longings if it beeps

     but i think that mindset is a mistake   before  there
were cattle prods governments tortured their prisoners with
clubs  and  rubber  hoses    before  there  were lasers for
eavesdropping governments used binoculars and  lipreaders
though  government certainly uses technology to oppress the
evil lies not in the tools but in the wielder of the tools

     in fact technology represents one of the most  promis
ing  avenues  available  for  recapturing our freedoms from
those who have stolen them  by its very nature  it  favors
the  bright  who can put it to use over the dull who can
not  it favors the adaptable who are  quick  to  see  the
merit  of  the  new  over  the sluggish who cling to time
tested ways  and what two better words are  there  to  de
scribe government bureaucracy than dull and sluggish

     one  of  the  clearest  classic triumphs of technology
over tyranny i see is  the  invention  of  the  manportable
crossbow   with it an untrained peasant could now reliably
and lethally engage a target out to  fifty  meterseven  if
that  target  were  a mounted chainmailed knight  unlike
the longbow which admittedly was more powerful and  could
get  off  more shots per unit time the crossbow required no
formal training to utilize   whereas the  longbow  required
elaborate  visual  tactile  and kinesthetic coordination to
achieve any degree of accuracy the wielder  of  a  crossbow
could simply put the weapon to his shoulder sight along the
arrow  itself and be reasonably assured of hitting his tar
get

     moreover since just about  the  only  mounted  knights
likely  to  visit  your  average peasant would be government
soldiers and tax collectors the utility of the  device  was
plain    with it the common rabble could defend themselves
not only against one another but against their governmental
masters   it was the  medieval  equivalent  of  the  armor
piercing  bullet  and consequently kings and priests the
medieval equivalent of a  bureau  of  alcohol  tobacco  and
crossbows  threatened  death  and  excommunication respec
tively for its unlawful possession

     looking at later developments we  see  how  technology
like  the  firearmparticularly the repeating rifle and the
handgun later followed by the gatling gun and more advanced
machine gunsradically altered the balance of interpersonal
and intergroup power  not without reason was the colt  fortyfive
called the equalizer  a frail dancehall hostess with one
in  her  possession  was  now  fully able to protect herself
against the brawniest roughneck in any saloon    advertise
ments  for  the period also reflect the merchandising of the
repeating cartridge  rifle  by  declaring  that  a  man  on
horseback  armed with one of these rifles simply cannot be
captured  and as long as his captors  were  relying  upon
flintlocks  or  singleshot rifles the quote is doubtless a
true one

     updating now to  the  present  the  publickey  cipher
with  a  personal  computer to run it represents an equiv
alent quantum leapin a defensive weapon    not  only  can
such  a technique be used to protect sensitive data in ones
own possession but it can also permit two strangers to  ex
change   information   over   an   insecure   communications
channela  wiretapped   phone   line   for   example   or
skywriting for that matterwithout ever having previously
met  to  exchange cipher keys   with a thousanddollar com
puter you can create a cipher that  a  multimegabuck  cray
xmp  cannot  crack in a year  within a few years it should
be economically feasible to similarly encrypt voice communi
cations soon after that fullcolor digitized video images
technology will not only have made wiretapping obsolete  it
will  have  totally demolished governments control over in
formation transfer

     i would like to take just a moment to sketch the  mathemat
ics  which makes this principle possible  this algorithm is
called the rsa algorithm after rivest shamir and  adleman
who  jointly created it  its security derives from the fact
that if a very large number is  the  product  of  two  very
large  primes  then it is extremely difficult to obtain the
two prime factors from analysis  of  their  product    ex
tremely  in  the  sense that if primes  p  and  q  have one hundred
digits apiece then their two hundreddigit product cannot  in  gen
eral be factored in less than one hundred years by the most powerful
computer now in existence

     the  public part of the key consists of one the prod
uct  pq  of the two large primes p and q and two  one  fac
tor  call it  x   of the product  xy  where  xy  pone 
qone  one  the private part of the key consists  of  the
other factor  y

     each  block of the text to be encrypted is first turned
into an integereither by using ascii  or  even  a  simple
aone  btwo  cthree   ztwentysix representation  this integer
is then raised to the power  x modulo pq and the resulting
integer is then sent as the encrypted message  the receiver
decrypts by taking this integer to the  secret  power    y
modulo  pq  it can be shown that this process will always
yield the original number started with

     what makes this a groundbreaking development  and  why
it  is  called  publickey  cryptography  is  that i can
openly publish the product  pq and the number   x     while
keeping  secret  the number  y  so that anyone can send me
an encrypted message namely
                       x
                     a    mod pq  
but only i can recover the original message  a   by  taking
what  they  send raising it to the power  y  and taking the
result mod pq  the risky step meeting to exchange cipher
keys has been eliminated  so people who may not even trust
each other enough to want to meet may  still  reliably  ex
change  encrypted  messageseach  party having selected and
disseminated his own  pq  and his  x     while  maintaining
the secrecy of his own  y

     another benefit of this scheme is the notion of a dig
ital signature to enable one to authenticate the source of
a given message  normally if i want to send you a message
i raise my plaintext  a  to your x and take the result  mod
your pq  and send that

    however  if in my message i take the plaintext  a and
raise it to my secret power  y   take the result  mod my
pq then raise that result to your x   mod  your  pq  and
send this then even after you have normally decrypted the
message  it  will still look like garbage  however if you
then raise it to my public power x    and take  the  result
mod  my public pq   so you will not only recover the ori
ginal plaintext message but you will know that no one but i
could have sent it to you since no one else knows my secret
y

     and these are the very concerns by the way that are to
day tormenting the soviet union about the whole question  of
personal  computers    on the one hand they recognize that
american schoolchildren are right now growing up  with  com
puters  as commonplace as sliderules used to bemore so in
fact because there are things computers can do  which  will
interest  and instruct three and fouryearolds  and it is pre
cisely these students who one generation hence will be going
headtohead against their soviet  counterparts    for  the
soviets  to  hold  back might be a suicidal as continuing to
teach swordsmanship  while  your  adversaries  are  learning
ballistics    on  the  other hand whatever else a personal
computer may be it is also an exquisitely efficient copying
machinea floppy disk will hold upwards of fiftyzero words  of
text  and  can  be  copied in a couple of minutes  if this
were not threatening enough the computer that  performs  the
copy  can also encrypt the data in a fashion that is all but
unbreakable  remember that in soviet society  publicly  ac
cessible  xerox  machines are unknown   the relatively few
copying machines in existence  are  controlled  more  inten
sively than machine guns are in the united states

     now  the  conservative position is that we should not
sell these computers to the soviets because they could  use
them  in weapons systems  the liberal position is that we
should sell them in  the  interests  of  mutual  trade  and
cooperationand  anyway  if  we do not make the sale there
will certainly be some other nation willing to

     for my part i am ready to suggest that the  libertarian
position should be to give them to the soviets for free and
if  necessary make them take them    and if that does not
work load up an srseventyone  blackbird  and  air  drop  them  over
moscow in the middle of the night  paid for by private sub
scription of course not taxation    i confess that this
is not a position that has gained much support among members
of  the conventional leftright political spectrum but af
ter all in the words of one of illuminatuss characters we
are political noneuclideans   the shortest distance  to  a
particular  goal may not look anything like what most people
would consider a straight line    taking  a  long  enough
worldview  it is arguable that breaking the soviet govern
ment monopoly on information transfer could better  lead  to
the enfeeblement and indeed to the ultimate dissolution of
the soviet empire than would the production of another dozen
missiles aimed at moscow

     but  there is  the rub  a long enough world view does
suggest that the evil the oppressive the coercive and  the
simply  stupid  will get what they deserve but what is not
immediately clear is how the rest of  us  can  escape  being
killed enslaved or pauperized in the process

    when  the  liberals and other collectivists began to at
tack freedom they possessed a reasonably  stable  healthy
functioning economy and almost unlimited time to proceed to
hamstring   and   dismantle  it    a  policy  of  political
gradualism was at least  conceivable    but  now  we  have
patchwork  crazyquilt  economy held together by baling wire
and spit  the state not only taxes us to  feed  the  poor
while also inducing farmers to slaughter milk cows and drive
up food pricesit then simultaneously turns around and sub
sidizes research into agricultural chemicals designed to in
crease  yields of milk from the cows left alive  or witness
the fact that a decline in the price of oil is considered as
potentially frightening as a comparable increase a few years
ago  when the price went up  we  were  told  the  economy
risked  collapse for for want of energy  the price increase
was called the moral equivalent of war and the feds  swung
into  action    for the first time in american history the
speed at which you drive your car to work in the morning be
came an issue of federal concern   now when the  price  of
oil  drops again we risk problems this time because ameri
can oil companies and third world  basketcase  nations  who
sell  oil  may  not  be  able to ever pay their debts to our
grossly overextended banks  the suggested panacea is  that
government  should now reraise the oil prices that opec has
lowered via a new oil tax  since the government is seeking
to raise oil prices to about the same extent  as  opec  did
what  can we call this except the moral equivalent of civil
warthe government against its own people

     and classically in international trade can you imag
ine any entity in the world except  a  government  going  to
court  claiming  that  a  vendor  was  selling  it goods too
cheaply and demanding not only that that naughty  vendor  be
compelled by the court to raise its prices but also that it
be punished for the act of lowering them in the first place

     so  while the statists could afford to take a couple of
hundred years to trash our  economy  and  our  libertieswe
certainly  cannot  count  on  having an equivalent period of
stability in which to reclaim them   i contend  that  there
exists  almost  a  black  hole  effect in the evolution of
nationstates just as in the evolution of stars  once free
dom contracts beyond a certain  minimum  extent  the  state
warps  the fabric of the political continuum about itself to
the degree that subsequent reemergence of  freedom  becomes
all but impossible  a good illustration of this can be seen
in the area of socalled welfare payments  when those who
sup  at the public trough outnumber and thus outvote those
whose taxes must replenish the trough  then  what  possible
choice has a democracy but to perpetuate and expand the tak
ing  from  the few for the unearned benefit of the many  go
down to the nearest welfare office find just  two  people
on  the dole    and recognize that between them they form
a voting bloc that can forever outvote you on  the  question
of who owns your lifeand the fruits of your lifes labor

     so essentially those who love liberty need an edge of
some  sort  if  we are ultimately going to prevail  we obvi
ously  cannot  use  the  altruists  otherdirectedness  of
work  slave suffer sacrifice so that next generation of
a billion random strangers can  live  in  a  better  world
recognize  that however immoral such an appeal might be it
is nonetheless an extremely powerful one in todays culture
if you can convince  people  to  work  energetically  for  a
because caring only enough for their personal welfare so as
to  remain  alive  enough  and  healthy  enough  to continue
workingthen you have a truly massive reservoir  of  energy
to draw from  equally clearly this is just the sort of ap
peal which tautologically cannot be utilized for egoistic or
libertarian goals  if i were to stand up before you tonight
and say something like listen follow me as i enunciate my
noble because contribute your money to support the because
give  up  your  free  time  to  work for the because strive
selflessly to bring it about and then after you  and  your
children are dead maybe your childrens children will actu
ally  live under egoismyou would all think i would gone mad  and
of course you would be right  because the point i am  trying  to
make is that libertarianism andor egoism will be spread if
when and as individual libertarians andor egoists find it
profitable andor enjoyable to do so    and  probably  only
then

     while i certainly do not disparage the concept of poli
tical  action i do not believe that it is the only nor even
necessarily the most costeffective path  toward  increasing
freedom  in  our time  consider that for a fraction of the
investment in time money and effort i might expend in  try
ing  to  convince  the  state to abolish wiretapping and all
forms of censorshipi can teach every libertarian who is in
terested  how  to   use   cryptography   to   abolish   them
unilaterally

     there  is  a  maxima proverbgenerally attributed to
the eskimoes which very likely most libertarians  have  al
ready  heard    and while you likely would not quarrel with
the saying you might well feel that you have heard  it  often
enough already and that it has nothing further to teach us
and moreover that maybe you are even tired of hearing it  i
shall therefore repeat it now

     if you give a man a fish the saying runs you feed him
for a day  but if you teach a man how to fish you feed him
for a lifetime

     your exposure to the quote was probably in some sort of
a  workfare  vs  welfare  context  namely that if you
genuinely wish to help someone in need you should teach him
how to earn his sustenance not simply how to  beg  for  it
and of course this is true if only because the next time he
is hungry there might not be anybody around willing or even
able to give him a fish whereas with the information on how
to fish he is completely self sufficient

     but  i  submit  that this exhausts only the first order
content of the quote and if there were nothing  further  to
glean  from  it  i would have wasted your time by citing it
again  after all it seems to have almost a cryptoaltruist
slant as though to imply that we should structure  our  ac
tivities  so  as  to  maximize  the  benefits to such hungry
beggars as we may encounter

     but consider

     suppose this eskimo does not know how to  fish  but  he
does  know  how  to hunt walruses   you on the other hand
have often gone hungry while traveling thru  walrus  country
because  you  had  no idea how to catch the damn things and
they ate most of the fish you could catch  and now  suppose
the  two  of  you  decide to exchange information bartering
fishing knowledge for hunting knowledge   well  the  first
thing  to  observe  is  that  a  transaction  of  this  type
categorically and unambiguously refutes the marxist  premise
that  every  trade  must  have a winner and a loser the
idea that if one person gains it must necessarily be at the
expense of another person who loses  clearly under  this
scenario such is not the case  each party has gained some
thing  he  did  not have before and neither has been dimin
ished in any way  when it comes to exchange of  information
rather  than material objects life is no longer a zerosum
game  this is an extremely powerful notion   the  law  of
diminishing   returns   the  first  and  second  laws  of
thermodynamicsall those laws which constrain our possi
bilities in other contextsno longer bind us   now  that is
anarchy

     or  consider  another possibility  suppose this hungry
eskimo never learned  to  fish  because  the  ruler  of  his
nationstate    had  decreed fishing illegal   because fish
contain dangerous tiny bones and sometimes sharp spines he
tells us the state has decreed that their  consumptionand
even  their  possessionare  too  hazardous to the peoples
health to be permitted    even by knowledgeable  willing
adults   perhaps it is because citizens bodies are thought
to be government property and therefore it is the  function
of the state to punish those who improperly care for govern
ment  property    or perhaps it is because the state gener
ously extends to competent adults the benefits it provides
to children and to the mentally ill  namely  a  fulltime
allpervasive supervisory conservatorshipso that they need
not  trouble  themselves  with making choices about behavior
thought physically risky or morally naughty  but in  any
case  you  stare stupefied while your eskimo informant re
lates how this law is taken so seriously that  a  friend  of
his was recently imprisoned for years for the crime of pos
session of nine ounces of trout with intent to distribute

     now  you  may  conclude  that  a society so grotesquely
oppressive as to enforce a law of this  type  is  simply  an
affront to the dignity of all human beings  you may go far
ther  and  decide to commit some portion of your discretion
ary recreational time specifically to the task of thwarting
this tyrants goal  your rationale may be altruistic  in
the   sense   of  wanting  to  liberate  the  oppressed  or
egoistic in the sense of  proving  you  can  outsmart  the
oppressoror  very likely some combination of these or per
haps even other motives

     but since you have zero desire to become a  martyr  to
your because you are not about to mount a military campaign
or  even try to run a boatload of fish through the blockade
however it is here that technologyand in  particular  in
formation technologycan multiply your efficacy literally a
hundredfold    i say literally because for a fraction of
the effort and virtually none of  the  risk  attendant  to
smuggling in a hundred fish you can quite readily produce a
hundred  xerox copies of fishing instructions  if the tar
geted government like presentday america at least permits
open  discussion  of  topics  whose  implementation  is  re
stricted  then that should suffice  but if the government
attempts to suppress the flow of information as  well  then
you will have to take a little more effort and perhaps write
your  fishing manual on a floppy disk encrypted according to
your mythical eskimos publickey parameters  but as far as
increasing realworld access to fish you have  made  genuine
nonzero  headwaywhich  may  continue to snowball as others
redisseminate the information you have provided   and  you
have not had to waste any of your time trying to convert id
eological  adversaries or even trying to win over the unde
cided  recall harry brownes dictum  from  freedom  in  an
unfree world that the success of any endeavor is in general
inversely proportional to the number of people whose persua
sion is necessary to its fulfilment

     if  you  look  at  history you cannot deny that it has
been dramatically shaped by men with names like  washington
lincoln        nixon      marcos    duvalier   
khadaffi     and their ilk  but it has also been  shaped
by  people with names like edison curie marconi tesla and
wozniak  and this latter shaping has been at least as  per
vasive and not nearly so bloody

     and  that is  where  i am  trying  to  take the libertech
project  rather than beseeching the state to please not en
slave plunder or constrain us i propose a libertarian net
work spreading  the  technologies  by  which  we  may  seize
freedom for ourselves

     but here we must be a bit careful  while it is not at
present  illegal  to  encrypt  information  when government
wants to spy on you there is no guarantee of what  the  fu
ture  may hold  there have been bills introduced for exam
ple which would have made it a crime  to  wear  body  armor
when government wants to shoot you  that is if you were to
commit certain crimes while wearing a kevlar vest then that
fact  would  constitute a separate federal crime of its own
this law to my knowledge has not passed    yet     but
it does indicate how government thinks

     other  technological  applications  however do indeed
pose legal risks  we recognize for  example  that  anyone
who  helped a precivil war slave escape on the underground
railroad was making a clearly illegal use of technologyas
the sovereign government of the united states of america  at
that time found the buying and selling of human beings quite
as  acceptable  as  the buying and selling of cattle  simi
larly during prohibition anyone who used  his  bathtub  to
ferment  yeast and sugar into the illegal psychoactive drug
alcoholthe controlled substance winewas using  technol
ogy  in a way that could get him shot dead by federal agents
for his crimeunfortunately not to be  restored  to  life
when  congress  reversed itself and repermitted use of this
drug

     so    to quote a former president  unindicted  co
conspirator  and pardoned felon    let me make one thing
perfectly clear  the libertech project does not  advocate
participate  in or conspire in the violation of any lawno
matter how oppressive  unconstitutional  or  simply  stupid
such  law may be  it does engage in description for educa
tional and informational  purposes  only  of  technological
processes  and some of these processes like flying a plane
or manufacturing a firearm may well require appropriate li
censing to perform legally    fortunately  no  license  is
needed  for  the  distribution or receipt of information it
self

     so the next time you look at the political  scene  and
despair  thinking  well  if fiftyone of the nation and fiftyone of
this state and fiftyone of this city have  to  turn  libertarian
before  i will  be  free  then  somebody might as well cut my
goddamn throat now and put me out of my  miseryrecognize
that  such  is not the case  there exist ways to make your
self free

     if you wish to explore such techniques via the project
you are welcome to give me your name and addressor a  fake
name  and  mail  drop for that matterand you will go on the
mailing list for my erraticallypublished newsletter    any
friends  or acquaintances whom you think would be interested
are welcome as well  i am not even asking for stamped  self
addressed envelopes since my printer can handle mailing la
bels and actual postage costs are down in the noise compared
with  the  other  efforts  in getting an issue out   if you
should have an idea to share or even a  useful  product  to
plug  i will be glad to have you write it up for publication
even if you want to be the proverbial free rider and  just
benefit  from  what others contributeyou are still welcome
everything will be public domain feel free to  copy  it  or
give it away or sell it for that matter because if you can
get  money  for  it while i am taking fullpage ads trying to
give it away you are certainly entitled to  your  capitalist
profit     anyway every application of these principles
should make the world just a little freer and i am certainly
willing to underwrite that at least for the forseeable  fu
ture

     i  will leave you with one final thought  if you do not
learn how to beat your plowshares into  swords  before  they
outlaw  swords  then you sure as hell ought to learn before
they outlaw plowshares too

 i understand the when one is in orbit the inward force of gravity at

force from the orbiting motion resulting in weightlessness

 i want to know what weightlessness actually feels like for example is
there a constant sensation of falling and what is the motion sickness
that some astronauts occasionally experience

subject re earwax
organization university of vermont  division of emba computer facility
lines twenty

hi stephen
ear wax is a healthy way to help prevent ear infections both by preventing
a barrier and also with some antibiotic properties  too much can block the
external auditory canal the hole in the outside of the ear and because some 
hearing problems  it is very simple and safe to remove excess wax on your
own or at your physicians office  you can take a syringe no needles and
fill it with fifty warm water cold can cause fainting and fifty otc hydrogen
peroxide  then point the ear towards the ceiling  about fortyfive degrees up
and insert the tip of the syringe helps to have someone else do this and  
firmly expell the solution  depending on the size of the syringe and the
tenacity of the wax this could take several rinses  if you place a bowl 
under the ear to catch the water it will be much drier   you can buy
a syringe with a special tip at your local pharmacy or just use whatever
you may have  if wax is old it will be harder and darker  you can try
adding a few drops of olive oil into the ear during a shower to soften up
the wax  do this for a couple days then try syringing again  it is also
safe to point your ear up at the shower head and allow the water to rinse
it out
good luck

in article one thousand nine hundred and ninetythreeaprtwentyonethirtytwo thousand four hundred and twentyseventwentytwo thousand four hundred and sixtyfourlelandstanfordedu punjabilelandstanfordedu sanjeev punjabi writes

as the heading indicates it is impossible for me to fathom why barry is not
batting fourth for the giants behind will clark  barry is such an awesome and
consistent hitter  definitely the best in the national league  imho to 
have williams a streaky hitter and not really a clutch hitter batting
fourth ahead of bonds is simply an injustice to the giants and fans of the
giants

two simple reasons

one   batting williams ahead of bonds will create a leftclark 
      rightwilliams leftbonds situation in the middle of the
      batting order  this makes it tougher for opposing manager
      to change pitchers

two   having bonds batting behind williams means that matt will get
      more good pitches to hit  this is important since he struggles
      so much with breaking balls  opposing pitchers do not want to
      walk williams to get to bonds

mph  on the same three to four lane road  around washington dc they cannot
keep traffic  flowing at fiftyfive

germans are just more organised you cannot blitz all of europe in a
matter of  what nine months unless you are pretty organised if we tried
that there would just be a whole bunch of tanks backed up at the border
waiting for some jerk in the right lane trying to get over to make a
left turn

this of course caused germany to invade belgium one of the important
lessons of history is that anything including late afternoon
thundershowers will cause germany to invade belgium

jblankenccatsasupennedu james r blankenship writes
 

jesus only and oneness tend to refer to groups that do deny the
trinity    
they explain matthew by saying that jesus is the name of the father jesus
is the name of the son and jesus is the name of the name of the holy
spirit father son  holy spirit referring to different roles all
filled by jesus 
 
imho this are going from bad to worse threeinone oneinthree was bad enough
 
i do not like a god who prays to himself  i refuse to believe jesus prayed
to himself     let us get real if the scriptures say he prayed to the
father then the father is someone different than the son  i have no
problems with multiple gods  to me the whole context of the scriptures
says  be perfect even as your father who is in heaven that we can be
coheirs with christ that we will be like him
 
coheirs share all things equallyincluding knowledge power dominion etc
when i am like him christ i will be the same as he isand he is a god
 
if god cannot do this the his is not all powerfuland he is not god
if he will not he is a liarand he is not god
 
but if he does he is the greatest of all the gods
 

i do not know of anyone who says that jesus prayed to himself  the
whole point of the trinity is that there is enough of a distinction
within god that relationship is possible  this implies some sort of
communication  i assume that in their native form the father and
son are directly enough connected that prayer in our sense is not
involved  but jesus is the incarnation of the son ie  the logos
made flesh  when he is in a human form his human actions are limited
to human capabilities  so communication with the father takes the
form of prayer  i do not see that there is anything problematical about
that  it seems to be implicit in the whole idea of incarnation

and no siggraph ninetythree has not skipped town  we are preparing the best
siggraph conference yet

speaking of siggraph i just went through the ordeal of my annual registration
for siggraph and reupping of membership in the acm last night and was i ever
grossed out  the new prices for membership are almost highway robbery

for example

	siggraph basic fee went from twentysix last year to fiftynine this year for the same
	thing a one hundred and twentyseven increase  those facile enough to arrange a trip to the
	annual conference could reduce this to twentyseven by selecting siggraph lite
	which means siggraph is charging an additional thirtytwo or so for the
	proceedings and the art show catalog essentially

	toplas went up forty in cost way outstripping the current inflation rate

	basic sigchi fees remainded the same but whereas before sigchi
	membership included uist and human factors conferences proceedings
	these are now an extra cost option  bundling that back into the basic
	rate equivalent services have gone up one hundred in cost

	sigois membership cost has up thirtythree but they have also split out the
	computer supported cooperative work conference proceedings that used to
	be included with membership  adding that cost back in means this sig
	also has doubled its membership fee

what really galls me is that the acm sent out brochures a couple months ago
touting their new approach to providing member services and tried to make it
sound like they were offering new services  but with the exception of a couple
like siggraph all the plus services appear to be just splitting the costs
into smaller piles so that they do not look so big  but their recommended
changes to my membership would have me paying ninety more than last year for a thirtyone
increase in services measured by cost not by value and curiously a thirtyone
inflation rate on the publications i got last year

is anyone out there as galled by this extortion as i am

discussing the use of irq seven

in  recent article mspraguesuperiormcwbstthree hundred and elevenb mike sprague writes

i as a number of poeple in this thread have already written
i cannot prove it is true but i believe it lptone does not
actually use irqseven even though that interrupt is supposed to
be dedicated to lptone

to put it a little differently

  irq seven is the de facto standard interrupt assigned to be used by the
   printer adapter to announce its completion of some activity

  dos does not monitor irq seven it uses other means to determine when it is
   time to send out another byte to the printer

  most all hardware printer adapters have the ability to disable
   the use of irq seven usually by merely breaking the connection between
   the isa pin and the associated driver  other adapters control the
   irq line by a tristate driver and by programming just leave it
   in the highimpedence mode

  unfortunately there are a lot of adapter cards which use bistate
   drivers ie either assert high or assert low for the irq lines
   rather than tristate drivers assert high assert low or do not
   assert anything  the presence of such a card on an irq line precludes
   the use of that irq by any other adapter unless it is physically 
   disconnected by a jumper

   incidentally note that there is no requirement that a card hold
   the irq line low when no interrupt is desired  if that were true
   you would have to somehow tie down all unconnected irq lines and
   that certainly is not a requirement

  nondos operating systems ostwo nt  various unices or whatever the
   proper plural of unix might be require the use of irq seven for performance
   reasons  

and the sbsixteen alas is one of the cards which uses bistate drivers

as promised here is rafiq zakarias discussion of the nature of
the socalled satanic verses from which rushdies title has been
taken rafiq zakaria muhammad and the quran penguin ninetyone

here follows an introduction to the controversial incident and an
 apologetic explanation purporting to show why it could not actually
 have happened  the historicity of the episode does not matter to what
 follows

i do not know whether i am quoting gregg or zakaria below  anyway back
to current affairs

rushdie has by his own admission drawn
on the version given by the orientalist watt 

among others this incident is not something rushdie or watt or anyone
else dug up from nowhere it is a well known story a myth if you
will known according to umar khan to every muslim school boy and
girl and so presumably to rushdie and to gibreel farishta

and then allowed his
imagination to run wild 

yes this is what writing fiction is all about  rushdie was writing
about a crisis of faith and chose this myth to present it by placing
the actor gibreel in the role of the angel whose name he took
rushdie was not writing a history or theology book and nowhere claims
or implies that this is what actually happened  it is somewhat like
stories woven around the relationship between jesus and the reformed
prostitute mary magdalene another myth  or those referring to the
arthurian mythos or the grail legend or the wandering jew or dozens
of others  if you can stand to read the work of a blasphemer
consider salman rushdies childrens book haroun and the sea of
stories for an idea of the way a storyteller  a specific
storyteller  works with existing story lines

to ridicule muhammads integrity

no  muhammads mahounds integrity is not really impugned in this
part of the story and there is no reason to think this was rushdies
intent gibreel as the archangel produces the verses divine and
satanic though he does not know their provenance  it is not implied
in a straight reading that muhammad influences them

     not my voice i would never know such words i am no classy speaker
    never was never will be but this is not my voice it is a voice
      mahounds eyes open wide he is seeing some kind of vision
    staring at it oh that is right gibreel remembers me  he is
    seeing me  my lips moving being moved by  what whom  do not
    know cannot say  nevertheless here they are coming out of my
    mouth up my throat past my teeth the words
      being gods postman is no fun yaar
      butbutbut god is not in this picture
      god knows whose postman i have been

it is ambiguous is mahound somehow manipulating gibreel  is it satan
or something else  the answer is not given

to be sure the question is raised  this novel explores faith and the
role of revelation in religion among other things  addressing loss
of faith implicitly raises questions about the truth of revelation
but this novel proposes no answers at least not directly  the very
existence of a newsgroup named altatheism raises the same
questions more forcefully and does propose some answers which is
the real relevance  if rushdies mild fictional exploration is filth
and lies and he asked for what he got are we next on the fatwa
list  that is a rhetorical question of course

take a look at the standings it is real easy to get so focussed on

working you do not screw it up by changing things just because you think it

so that is the reason why the toronto blue jays should keep alfredo

a team not winning does not mean that everything that it is doing is wrong or
otherwise to borrow the sharks situation you would say that george kingston

some folks like to argue about theoretical details i prefer to watch teams
win when the giants slip to third then we can talk about how to rearrange
the batting order until then i think it is stupid to focus on what is wrong
for the simple fact that it is working as it is

by then it is too late  the problem with not fixing something while it is
working is that by then there may not be anything left to fix

mostly though the giants are winning and frankly as long as that
continues it is rather silly to secondguess their strategy but evidently

nntppostinghost hernessun

in article  nmzerowandrewcmuedu nanci ann miller writes
emarshhernessunengsuncom eric marsh writes
 by the way the parallel universe approach implys an element of mind in the
 very physical reality of the universe 

this sounds interesting but what exactly do you mean  

well the best thing to do is to read the book parallel universes
by dr fred wolf 

in essence dr wolf says that one interpretation of the subatomic
particlewave duality is that what we perceive as a wave is actually
an infinate number of parallel universes overlaid and in each of
these universes there is a particle in a different location when we
do something to make a particle appear we are actually causing
all the parallel universes to collapse into one apparently this is
one line of thought on the nature of qm that is going through some
of the scientific community

dr wolf and many others claim that somehow the collapse is caused
by the mental effort of observing the particle this implys that
mind is more than merely a biological phenomenon he then extrapolates
that if mind is an integral part of the universe then perhaps consciousness
is the element that gives order and form to the universes itthemselfs

it all gets rather interesting but what i find facinating is that
this would explain the phenomenon of magick as practiced in my
religion dr wolf speculates that the ordering functionality of mind
could be caused by the selection of a future from an infinite number of
possible futures he says that this might be done by some sort of
communication between ones current and possible future selves 
i have long speculated that if magick is not merely a form of self
delusion then perhaps it could be caused by some sort of a selection
of one of many possible futures

i realize that this gets pretty bizarre but it never hurts to keep 
an open mind and at least file it all away as another possibile 
explaination of the world in which we find ourselves after all the
more we learn about the universe in which we live the more we learn
that it is truly a very strange place

evolution as i have said before is theory and fact  it is exactly
the same amount of each as the existence of atoms and the existence of
gravity  if you accept the existence of atoms and gravity as fact
then you should also accept the existence of evolution as fact

 
andy

i do not accept atoms or gravity as fact either  they are extremely useful
mathematical models to describe physical observations we can make
other posters have aptly explained the atomic model  gravity too is
very much a theory no gravity waves have even been detected but we
have a very useful model that describes much of the behavior on
objects by this thing we call gravity  gravity however is not 
a fact  it is a theoretical model used to talk about how objects 
behave in our physical environment  newton thought gravity was a
simple vector force einstein a wave both are very useful models that 
have no religious overtones or requirements of faith unless of course you 
want to demand that it is a factual physical entity described exactly 
the way the theory now formulated talks about it  that takes a great 
leap of faith which of course is what religion takes  evolution
is no different

 
 jim halat         halatbearcom     

are you serious  here is an exercise next time you are in the barnyard 
take your model and hold it directly above a fresh cowpie  then release the
model  you will observe that on its own your model will assume a trajectory
earthward and come to rest exactly where it belongs  watch out for splatters
particularly if you are wearing shorts when you perform this experiment

   as written the second ammendment states rather clearly for anyone who can
   read the following

   a well regulated militia being necessarry to the security of a free state
   the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed

  what is regulated regulated means controlled how about security

stephen a creps writes to all



 sac also we know that
 sac the bible says that everyone must be baptized to enter heaven

where exactly does it say that

 sac everyone includes infants unless there is other scripture to the
 sac contrary ie an exception  since there is no exception listed in the
 sac bible we must assume to be on the safe side that the bible means what
 sac it says that everyone must be baptized to enter heaven

i think we do see an exception in the case of cornelius and his
household mentioned in acts of course they were baptised but only
after god showed that he accepted them by giving them the holy
spirit this means they were already acceptable to god before their
baptism and had they suddenly died they would have gone to heaven

in case that seems farfetched  an ancestor of mine was a missionary
who worked among the hereros in namibia some of the tribesmen were
jealous of christianity and they poisoned the first convert before he
could be baptised surely he still went to heaven i am inclined to
agree with a comment recorded at the time it is not the neglect of
baptism but its contempt that condemns

can anyone offer a suggestion on a problem i am having
i have several boards whose sole purpose is to decode dtmf tones and send
the resultant in ascii to a pc  these boards run on the serial interface
i need to run  of the boards somwehat simultaneously  i need to be able to ho
ok them up to a pc  the problem is how do i hook up eight serial devices to one
pc inexpensivley so that all can send data simulataneously or close to it
any help would be greatly appreciated


are the boards at all intelligent  ie run by microcontrollers  the
easiest thing would be to have another line that says that one of the
boards is talking to the pc  when this line was true the other boards
could all hold off and not send their data  this is not a perfect solution
though since you have to worry a little about making sure two boards do not
decide to talk at the exact same time

other than that i think you will need to hook up each board to something
that speaks rstwo hundred and thirtytwo  this actually is not as hard or as expensive as it
used to be though  assuming the boards talk relatively slowly nine thousand six hundred bps
or slower the pics can coordinate things between themselves to multiplex
the data  this is really just forbicly adding the suggestion in the first
paragraph to your system  and it assumes that each board does not talk more
than oneeightth of the time of for very long since a pic is not going to be
able to buffer more than maybe twentysome bytes

you might want to check into the prices of multiserial card for your pc

one thing to recall  putting a satellite as high as possible is one thing 
coming back to not only that altitude but matching the position of it in 
its orbit on a subsequent mission is another thing  any misalignment of the 
plane of the orbit during launch or being ahead or behind the target will 
require more fuel to adjust  this was considered in the original deployment 

i agree though that the demands on the crew and complexity are stupendous

presented without any evidence to support it  if you are able to present
real evidence for it then great  but unsupported claims or even claims
by such and such news agency will not be accepted  if you want to
stick to the sheer impossible instead of the merely difficult then
fine  

the statement that if such a fact is classified then you 
cannot prove it is a simple matter of pragmatics and the law  if you 
have access to classified information that you know to be classified
and you reveal it there is a good chance that you or someone else 
the person who revealed it to you is going to jail

if you are considering buying a system with a view to using
it to run unix linux bsd etc or some other special software
there is a good chance that it will not work with the diamond cards

that is if the special software is free like xfreeeightysix  there are
vendors that sells diamond x drivers for commercial unices  but
then they charge 

this is due to diamonds propriety attitude to it is hardware
it is impossible to get free information from them about their chips 
specifically their dotclocks without paying and signing nondisclosure
agreements

i think they only need a signing ie no paying  this still
violates the fsfs policy of publically available code

this made it impossible for the free software foundation to provide
xwindows compatibility with these cards as diamond did not want to 
divulge programming neccessities

while this is true there are fixes for those who have already
bought diamond cards  in linux for example there are utilities
that will put the card in vesa mode before invoking x  of course
this means no fine tuning of diamond cards but at least this
will allow those who are stuck with them to use linuxx

i agree with marks suggestion  if you are buying a video card
for specialized free software avoid diamond  but if you already
have one there may be a fix that can help you

                    this weeks thoughts 

last week the supreme court refused without comment to hear an
appeal by rensselaer in school officials desiring the
distribution of bibles in their public schools relsixtyfive fivetwentyone a
lower court had banned the local gideons an international bible
distribution group from passing out bibles to fifthgraders the
aclus barry lynn was quoted as saying that the courts action
protected the religious neutrality of our public schools he also
said that schools must serve students of all faiths and none
schools were not to be a bazaar where rival religious groups
compete for converts according to lynn

several gideons men who are responsible for putting bibles in
hospitals and hotels are members of our church they tell of
similar stories where they are only allowed to distribute bibles on
sidewalks around the schools but cannot go inside the schools
they tell of mild harassment by parents who do not want their
children receiving a bible from a stranger they are willing to
continue their work at a distance but find the schools position
somewhat disheartening

i understand rationally and logically the courts position and i
can see the sense of fairness for all groups but on the other
hand when does neutrality become nihilism when does plurality
turn into no position at all

i see a couple of ironies here one is that we can pass out condoms
but not bibles in our schools think on that one for a moment

the other is that while we are seeking religious neutrality in
our schools countries like russiawho by the way practiced
religious neutrality for the past seventy yearsare making the 
bible part of their public school curriculum when i was in st
petersburg in march the church we worked with had trained over one hundred
public school teachers to teach the bible and the government had
requested hundreds more i recently heard a medical doctor who is
president of the gideon chapter in moscow tell how they are eagerly
invited to the university of moscow to distribute bibles to the
students and are given class time to explain its contents i
remember seeing a photograph of this doctor holding a bible and
speaking to the university students standing under a statue of
lenin now that is ironic

i admit two things one we are a pluralistic society and all faiths
have equal footing this is what our country was founded on two to
allow every group on school grounds could create a bazaarlike
atmosphere each city must work to be inclusive of all religions
and provide a hearing for them threei know i said twothe vitality
of religious faith is not dependent upon whether or not the public
arena acknowledges it as valid

howeverand you knew this was comingi believe disallowing the
distribution of the bible by lawabiding caring adults in our
schools only signals once again our cultures movement away from a
singular base from which we as individuals and as a nation can make
moral and ethical decisions

i would not think so  asking people to trust a secret algorithm seems
unsound to me

maybe so but it is quite common

not when your talking about cryptography

there are millions of macintosh users who
have no idea what is in apples patented roms many have modems connected
how do you know all your business secrets are not being stolen answer
one because you trust apple

think again  you will not see me using apples new signature from the
finder feature

two because if any such attempt however sophicsticated came out it would
destroy apples credibility forever

this analogy fails in its assumption that the government gives two
squirts about credibility


in addition apples proclaimed purpose in releasing the macintosh was not
survellience

quite the opposite
on january twentyfour apple will introduce macintosh and you will see why
one thousand nine hundred and eightyfour will not be like one thousand nine hundred and eightyfour

so do not give me any bullshit analogies about how we trust coke not to
put mind control drugs in every can to get us to buy more


in the clipper case a representative body of experts is going to be allowed
to audit it and we will have assurances maybe even from the president that
other than the escrowed keys there are no back doors while some may not
have confidence in that i am not among them it is a lot more assurance
than we get for many things we routinely trust in everyday life

 default you refer to prison is not a normal situation

is this an arguement against or for  or simply a statement of agreeance

does not the bible say that god is a fair god sic  if this is true
how can this possibly be fair to the infants

andrew byler writes

what do you mean fair  god is just giving to everyone what they
deserve as all infants are in sin from the time of conception cf
romans fivetwelve psalm oneseven they cannot possibly merit heaven and as
purgatory is for the purging of temporal punishment and venial sins it
is impossible that origianl sin can be forgiven

why is it fair to punish you me and the rest of humanity because of
what adam and eve did suppose your parents committed some crime before
you were born and one day the cops come to your door and throw you in
jail for it would you really think that is fair i know i would not

well suppose your mother was a crack addict and crack userabuser while
she was pregnant suppose your husband gave you some sdt this recently
happened to a close friend of my wife and mine

often the consequences of our sin are at least partially inflicted on
innocent people several times in the ot this is pointed out even
saying that descendants would suffer consequences for a persons sin
for several generations even today we see multigenerational to
coin a phrase effects from alcoholism child abuse and spousal
abuse just to name three

so gods definition of fair and ours differ

some points of perspective

though the predisposition towards sinning is now inbred see websters
first definition of inbred thanks to adam it is arrogant and foolish
for any of us to think we would have done any different if we were in
their shoes i know myself pretty well and i am just not that good take
gods word for it neither are you there is no one righteous

more important when a person decides to be a disciple of jesus god
promises supernatural help in overcoming our physical selfs sinful
tendency we can of course choose to ignore this help rom seveneight

  one so what
 
 homosexuals lie about the ten number to hide the disproportionate
 involvement of homosexuals in child molestation  they also lie
 about ten to keep politicians scared
 

back your statments with proof or shut up

  two it will be interesting to see the reaction when twofivemillion queers
     gather in washington dc after all if there are only sixmillion of
     us then this is an event unprecidented in history
 
 but many of the people who will be marching are not homosexuals but
 other members of the leftist agenda
 

again back your statements or shut up

  the article also contains numbers on the number of sexual partners
  the median number of sexual partners for all men twentythirtynine was seventhree
  
  do not forget that twentyfive had twenty or more partners
 
 not surprising  remember that study includes homosexuals as well
 

hmm  tell me did you go to the mickey mouse school of logic  you have
just stated that there are not many homosexuals as kinsey reported in his
survey and the surveys of the kinsey institute since  then you say that
the reason many young people are promiscuous is because homosexuals form
a large part of that group or there are some homosexuals whose lives 
consist of having sex with no gaps for eating c  using your logic
it would seem to suggest that on average gay men have about two thousand partners each
a week  try to think through your arguments carefully  or then again not
because i like to laugh every now and then

  compared to the table i have already posted from masters johnson
  and kolodny showing male homosexual partners it is apparent that
  homosexual men are dramatically more promiscuous than the general
  male population  
  
  and what did this study show for number of sexual contacts for those
  who said they where homosexual or is that number to inconvient for
  you
 
 it was not published
 

hence the argument cannot be resolved using this data  next point please

  it is a shame that we do not have a breakdown for
  straight men vs gaybi men  that would show even more dramatically
  how much more promiscuous gaybi men are
  
  fuck off
 
 typical homoseuxal response
 
 

this depends on the premise that there are only three types of behaviour gay bi
and hetero  this has yet to be proved  see an earlier post about the kinsey
institute of grading  this although rough seems more logical  also you use
this would show defining a fact and not an assumption  again back your 
statements or shut up

it is interesting sometimes to listen to yous news as seen through
the eyes of another country

bbc world news service on shortwave originating out of london
reports that a survivor of the waco massacre states that a tank when
making a hole in the wall of the building knocked over a kerosene
lamp and that is how the fire started  attempts were made by the
people inside to put out the fire but it spread too quickly

has anyone in yous heard anything similar or are yous government

the bbc news is also reporting that about twenty of those that died

 hi there
 
 i am german and i have been into this mlb stuff since almost one year now
 there are many problems occuring for me one of them is the era statistic for
 pitchers what does it say 

era indicates the average number of earned runs attributed to a pitcher per
nine inning game  thus if a pitcher pitched three innings and gave up one earned
run his nine inning equivelent perfomance would be three earned runs thus his era
is threezero  to compute the era you simply take the number of earned runs divided
by the innings pitched and then multiple the result by nine

	era  erip  nine

i think there is another formula for era  i heard something about it last 
year  i am not sure what it is but i am going to give it a stab  it allows for
a pitcher to pitch more than nine innings at a time and not benefit cuz it
uses outs recorded instead of innings pitched

        era  ertwentysevenouts recorded

like i said i am not sure this is exactly it but i am pretty sure they changed
it to something of the sort


an earned run is run that is given up by the pitcher that is not attributed
to a fielding error  more specifically if an error occurs that represented
the third out all runs scored after the error are considered unearned runs
earned runs are also runs scored as a result of players who were left on base
when the pitcher exited the game  here are some examples

	if there are two outs in an inning and there are men on base  if
	an error occurs that represents the third out all of the runs after
	this error and not counted as earned runs

	if a pitcher issues some base on balls walks and leaves the game
	before the inning is completed he is responsible for the people who
	were left on base  if the those runners who were left on base score
	and the score was not a result of an error those eraned runs are
	attributed to the pitcher who left the game

i hope this explains things for you

   the serial number will be in a sixtyfour bit block with a thirtyfour bit filler  does not
   take a lot to check to see if that is correct

depends on whether the filler is a constant makes checking easy
but susceptible to replay or variable eg timer counter random
which makes replay harder and can also make it easier for the
inquisitors to know if they have missed messages or gotten them out of
sequence or other interesting things that sort of person might care about

i would use a secret nope obscure cryptographic encoding to expand the 
thirty bit serial number to a sixtyfour bit block the redundancy hereby introduced 
can be used to detect tampered clipper signals where some public enemy 
replaced the le block by random data 

and of course the le block would be used to initialise the encryption 
of the user data so that at the receiving end the correct le block must 
be processed in order to have any chance of getting the plaintext back 

for those of you who might want to mangle the le block eg by xoring 
a constant pattern on the transmission line and restore it before feeding 
it into the receiving crippler chip i would add further encrypted copies 
of this block perhaps created by repeated application of the encryption 
algorithm or so at regular intervals during the transmission if the 
receiving chip detects a mismatch it must assume that the line is bad and 
it will cease to work in your own interest you are protected from getting 
faulty plaintext you know  it is just like a checksum for your own 
safety  

the monitoring agencies will not have the famous black box which is needed 
for actual decryption and will be kept by the fbi but nothing prevents 
them from using special boxes which will do the redundancy check for the 
serial number block and consistency checks on the embedded le blocks 
within the transmission these boxes will turn a red light on as soon as 
they detect a bitstream that violates the correct protocol

so do not anyone think that you can use the chip and fool le about the 
tapping key  i bet the developpers have provided much better checks 
than those suggested above of course it is absolutely crucial that the 
algorithms and protocols remain secret personally i doubt they will

 i have been getting mail from xhibition about the june conference and i was
 wondering if microsoft had bought xhibition  the front says conference
 from microsoft windows nt developers  what is the deal  i thought
 xhibition was for xwindows
 
  
       jesse w asher                                          

yes xhibition is for the x window system  the x window system conference 
remains the largest and most complete conference devoted to x  nineteen full
and half day tutorials and thirtysix technical sessions over three days
provide huge amounts of information for x application developers  add vendor
exhibits and a product presentation track to provide information on what
folks can purchase today and you have a complete show focused on xeleven

speakers at xhibition ninetythree include 

  bob schiefler lu abel mark ackerman paul asente doug blewett 
  donna converse jim fulton oliver jones keith packard ralph swick 
  doug young and many others

xhibition is growing fortunately for us and we have added some additional
conferences  surveys that we have given have indicated additional topics of
interest  these include object oriented technologies such as the object
management groups orb and corba c as it applies to x client server
technologies such as dce threads databases object oriented and relational
and not surprisingly when you look at the audience windows nt

with the bulk of the xhibition audience and the unix community developing
applications for inhouse or custom use a new thirtytwobit operating system from a
player as large as microsoft needs to be evaluated with ms windows on so many
desktops and the price of computing power dropping its successor needs to be
evaluated  as corporations begin to look at nt so must their developers and
suppliers

the mission of the xhibition technical conferences is to provide information
to the application developer and to the technology planner  the nt conference
at xhibition is designed to do just that  we worked with microsoft to provide
the only conference this year specifically designed to show x and unix
developers the capabilities of windows and nt  if you are not sure that nt has
what you need for your application development or systems deployment this is
the place to find out  ask the folks from microsoft get them to show you
what you need  conference attendees will receive nt software development
kits to bang on evaluate and generally to see for yourself

i hope this does not sound like an nt commercial it should sound like an
xhibition commercial  i just want to reiterate that the xhibition audience
is growing and xhibition is growing along with it  the industry is a
confusing place at the moment with unix cose nt dce corba and all of
the other acronyms sprouting up  xhibition can help sort out the confusion

i need information on the medical including emotional  pros and
cons of circumcision at birth  i am especially interested in
references to studies that indicate disadvantages or refute studies
that indicate advantages  a friend who is a medical student is
writing a survey paper and apparently the studies she has run into
are all for circumcision the main argument being a lower risk of
penile cancer

please email responses as i am not a frequent reader of either group
i will summarize to the net

i am very surprised that medical schools still push routine circumcision
of newborn males on the population since your friend is not a man she


money probably has a lot to do with keeping the practice of routine 
circumcision alive it is another opporitunity to charge a few hundred
extra bucks for a completely unnecessary procedure the rationale for 
which until recently has been accepted without question by most
parents of newborns  

one could also imagine that complications arising from circumcision
infections sloppy jobs etc are far more common than the remote chance
of penile cancer it is purported to prevent  
 

cannot imagine what it is like to have a penis much less a foreskin i
guess if american medicine did an artistic job of circumcising every
male then the visual result would be somewhat more natural in
appearance

the penile cancer thing has been completely debunkedshe must be
going to school on a south pacific island tell her to check the journal
or urology for circumcision articles i remember at least one on an old
jewish man cut at birth who developed penile canceri mean if the
cancer risk was that great the europe who have been circumcising like
crazy too teaching a boy how to keep his cockhead clean is the issue a
little proper hygiene goes a long way  americans are just too hung up on
the penis to consider cleaning it that is just way too much like
mastubation so you have surgical intervention that is basically
unnecessary

if anybody has a strong claim to control of the  the night sky it is 
astronomers  check out the common law  in the days when wild lands
were not scarce pioneers laid claim to the land by putting it to
use eg clearing and growing a crop  even trespassers can lay claim to 
the right of passage if if they have done it for long enough and the
owners have not complained or taken steps to stop them  usage
begets property rights

astronomers have been using the night sky for thousands of years 
they own it 
eg light polluters they will lose their commonlaw right of ownership

another consequence of their ownership is that they are free to sell
it  now astronomers need money for their work  if light
polluting billboards and mirrors go up they will need even
more money to buy extra image processing equipment filters
space telescopes etc to get around the problem

so as long as we can define who astronomers are eg do
they include amateur astronomers  nature lovers
we can set up a system of voluntary consensus to solve this
dispute instead invoking bans regulations etc enforced
by bribed politicians at the point of a gun why do folks always
think of that sordid solution we ought to pass a law to
solve problems first instead of as a last resort when other
methods have failed

stuff deleted
  this proposal certainly needs work but how about working on 
these kind of ideas first before writing there ought to be a law 
letters to our congresscritters let us give noncoercive consensus via 
the free market a chance to solve this problem

jim hart
jhartagoraraincom

would mr hart please explain how one could get every nation on
earth and every corporation to agree that astronomers own the
night sky without coercion   remember that not every nation
follows the english common law   in most countries for most of
history it was probably true that the rulers owned everything
not explicitly owned by individuals   even in north america
where by the principle enunciated the aboriginal inhabitants should
have owned everything when new arrivals wanted to use land
and resources they just took it over  in case mr hart has not noticed
there is currently a brutal war going on in bosnia about who owns what
of course if some friendly super power were to give an international
astronomy organization some antisatelite missiles and also agree
to defend it if attacked such a proposal might work but it
would hardly be noncoercive

some of us nutty environmentalists think it might make sense first
to try to mobilize public opinion against advertising in space
and also to use governmental actions like taxing power for example
to discourage them   this of course would be too coercive for

dougbcommmotcom doug bank writes

my wifes obgyn has an ultrasound machine in her office  when

on her next visit my wife asked another doctor in the office if
they read the ultrasounds themselves or if they had a radiologist
read the pictures  the doctor very vehemently insisted that they
were qualified to read the ultrasound and radiologists were not

my wife is concerned about this  she saw a tv show a couple months
back something like twentytwenty or dateline nbc etc where an expert
on fetal ultrasounds a radiologist was showing all the different
deffects that could be detected using the ultrasound

should my wife be concerned  should we take the pictures to a 
radiologist for a second opinion and if so where would we find
such an expert in chicago  we do not really have any special medical
reason to be concerned but if a radiologist will be able to see
things the obgyn cannot then i do not see why we should not use one

any thoughts

 as far as i can see if your obstetrition has an ultrasound in his rooms
and is expirienced its use and interpretation he should be just as
capable of reading it as any radiologist all doctors are qualified to
read xrays yous ct scans etc it is just that a radiologist does nothing
else and thus is only better at reading them because of all this time
spent doing this skill in reading xrays etc just comes from plenty of
practice if your obstetrition reads heaps of obstetric ultrasounds he
should be able to pick up any abnormalities that can be demonstrated by

 	anyway  i am looking for advice for the use of
 antihistamines as sleep aids  and if there are any dangers of such use
 seems safe to me since they are used chronically for allergies by
 millions  i do not want to try bzs  because bz addiction seems to be
 a serious threat  and from what i hear  bz sleep quality is not good
 whereas antihistamine sleep quality seems to be better for me  i have
 tried some dietary tryptophan loading stuff  and that also seems to
 lower sleep quality  i seem to wake up around fourzero or so and be in some
 kind of mental haze until sevenzero or eightzero  also  i would be interested in
 any other advice for helping my problem  although i have already tried
 many of the nonpharmacological solutions

antihistamines have been the active ingredient of otc sleep aids for
decades  go to any drugstore and look at the packages of such sleep
aids as sominex nytol etc  the active ingredient is
diphenhydramine the same antihistamine that is in benadryl

let me give you another story that actually happened to me  we sell
communications boards that use a sixtyeight thousand  they used to be high tech our
agent in the uk sold a system to a company in ch which packaged it in a
product for cz londonbernprague  i telexed the brits and told them
the swiss need to pass export paperwork through the us as at the time
you needed an export lisence for these systems

now i knew the nsa was watching this traffic just like they are watching
this traffic

and what do you know two weeks later an agent of the us government shows
up in my office to remind me if we or our agents sold systems into the evil
empire we had better make sure the export lisences were handled properly

he was part of a five man office in columbus ohio who did this stuff
based on sources he could not reveal i assume most of the time these
guys sat around the office with their thumbs up their ass as there is not
that much stuff coming out of columbus 

wow the electric utility in prague sure is a big worry for these folks 

the point is we have created a giant bureaucracy nsa with a budget
bigger than the cias who like all bureaucracies fill their time looking
for things to do  the evil empire is gone  the nsa is not  they will do
something to fill their time and justify their budgets  i just wish they
too would sit around with their thumbs up their ass but that is too
much to hope for they will spy on us and do things like skipjack and
subvert people like dorothy denning  sigh

austin c archer archausaturnwwcedu wrote

i am interested in views about the nonevent of may three seriously how can a 
christian discriminate between messages from god which are to be taken 
seriously and those which are spurious  is there a useful heuristic which 
would help us avoid embracing messages which by their nonfulfillment are 
proven to be false thus causing the name of christ to be placed in 
disrepute is this a problem at all

it is possible that the individual saw a true prophetic vision but that he
interpreted the scale of time and space according to his material con
sciousness translating the supersensible perceptions of a plane above
that of time and space into an immediate worldly context  and getting it
wrong  not that he did it rationally but rather that unconsciously the
perceptions became clothed in material images instead of remaining in the
realm of the potential and notyettimespacebound  this difficulty of
translating prophetic vision into a concrete when and where has always been
difficult even for the prophets of old  that is why their prophecies are
so often subject to multiple interpretations  likewise the apostles seemed
to feel that the return of the lord was to be very soon in the sense of
perhaps the same generation yet the meaning of very soon has proven to
be different than they could grasp  prophetic vision tends to telescope
time so that things that are far off appear to be very close

another possibility is that the vision was one of a real event preparing to
happen again in the realm of the potentialbutnotyetmanifest and which
was thwarted by other forces including possibly an act of divine mercy

there are many concrete prophecies being made these days by devout and
sincere and sober christians and others too  it seems that great coming 
events are really casting their shadow before their arrival in these 
apocalyptic times  the various predictions i am talking about those that
appear to be sincere and sober are hard to accept yet hard to ignore com
pletely  one has the feeling something is about to start to get ready to 
begin to commence to happen  we are living as the chinese saying goes
in interesting times

as for how to discriminate the bible does not help much  there is an old
testament passage i forget where it is that says you will know whether
a prophet is true by whether or not his prophecy comes to pass  that
helps eliminate the failures after the fact but in the case of an earth
quake it is small comfort  it seems to me that all prophecies that give
specific times and places and events should be suspect not in that they
are necessarily false but in the sense stated above that all such visions
are subject to mistranslation from the plane of prophetic vision to the
plane of earthly time and space

for what it is worth rudolf steiner once was asked whether a modern initiate 
could see into the future and predict coming events  his answer was that 
it would be possible but then he would have to withdraw from active parti
cipation in them including proclaiming what he saw  if this is in fact
a spiritual law then the answer to your question about how to discriminate
is that the one who makes such prophecies is probably violating that law
knowingly or unknowingly and as such his message should be considered
a priori to be dubious  ie i would expect that those capable of making
true predictions and giving accurate expression to them would not do so in 
the way that the prophet of the oregon earthquake did  however i can
sympathize with the person who published the prophecy given the same
overwhelming experience that he apparently had  i too might feel impelled 
and even commissioned by god to tell my fellow human beings about what 
i had seen

from natarajartsgmotcom kumaravel natarajan

but they can put out a lot of particulate matter  i heard
something about legislation being discussed to clean up
diesel emissions  is there anything in the works to
install scrubbers for diesels  how about the feasibility
of installing them on trucks and cars  would it be any
different than a catylitic converter  i would assume easier
since we are removing particulate matter instead of converting
gasses  let us hear peoples opinions

the technology cummins is applying to diesels to comply with
the newer ca emissions laws involves three things i know of

one all compliant diesels are turbocharged
two all use an aftercooler which cools the air which was heated
   by compression by the turbocharger up to about twentyfive psi
three a gismo on the injector pump which senses the pressurized air
   intake and limits full delivery of fuel while the pressure is
   low

no scrubbers catalytic converters etc are used  the path from
the turbocharger to the exhaust outlet is kept very free

interestingly except for the lowpressure fuel limitation power output 
and mileage are enhanced by these measures  one can buy aftermarket
turbos and aftercoolers which generate more power lots more power
and these are approved by the carb

 other hardware includes modemfax serial ports and a teletext board

applications used include normal windows stuff excel word quicken

work environment which includes turtle beach wave for windows mcs stereo
and other misc stuff for dinking around with audio files  also i use
stacker on the primary drive hp newwave for my wifes use and she 
will not let me get rid of it and a product called infinite disk from 
chili pepper software for hierarchical storage management of my seldom 
used offline files  

i plan to upgrade to nt when it becomes a released product  i was stongly
tempted to become a beta user early on but i do not have time to mess around
with the hassles of beta software  i expect to buy it tear off the 
shrink wrap and use it without hassle i know unrealistic but i can
hope cannot i after all i have work to do

the advice i want concerns the state of nt regarding device drivers and 
hardware specific stuff in general  how smoothly can i expect the 
upgrade to go  can i expect support for all my stuff or do i
still need to scramble around downloading drivers pas orchid colorado 
from some bbs etc  what steps should i take to ensure the installation
goes smoothly  note that i want to nuke dos totally from the system  i am
allergic to command lines  i plan to run a pure nt system  also will 
nt communicate with the workgroups lan  what about stacker  i currently 
have stacker on the first disk drive  without stacker and the infinite 
disk product i will have great difficulty fitting everything i have on the 
system it is cramped now

i realize stacker will be incompatible with nt but will there be an nt 
version  or will nt support compression a la dos six  i know infinite disk
will be incompatible with nt but will they offer or does anybody else
a comparable product for nt and at what cost  perhaps i need to ask 
chili pepper that question  i can live without id if i have to but i would
rather not  will nt run my dos apps the teletext board mainly without
dos on the system  what do i need to keep around

any feedback or advice including forget nt with good reasons is much
appreciated  my only significant reason for moving to nt is i need a better
multitasking environment than windows among other reasons wave locks up
the machine for hours and hours doing dsp processing on large audio files
and i want better lan support than i now have internet access etc  maybe
there are better solutions than nt and if so i would appreciate hearing 
about them ostwo  what is it is status these days

pls respond by email and if there is interest i will summarize for the net

however it did not help the problem  i have also identified that when the machine boots and the drive seeks for a boot disk the head movement during this process is now approximately half the length of the original time  what i mean is the period when the drive light comes on and the heads move from their retracted position out to the track containing the boot sector

pardon me your ignorance cramps my conversation although the administrative 
mechanism was a strictly centralized one the ottoman empire was a classical 
example of a pluralist social order the millet system was the mechanism 
which shaped the social order of the multinational ottoman empire and stood 
behind its continuity as a matter of fact because islamic principles 
were in force in the ottoman empire it was natural to use religious 
criteria to differentiate among the various communities which constituted 
the empire the millet system began to be based on ethnicity in the 
nineteenth century under the influence of nationalism sousa writes of the 
existence of thirteen communities in the ottoman empire in addition to 
the muslim millet in one thousand nine hundred and fourteen these were one greeks attached to the 
orthodox patriarchate in istanbul two catholics or latins who were 
remnants of genoese and venetian merchants three gregorian armenians

 something about legislation being discussed to clean up
 diesel emissions  is there anything in the works to
 install scrubbers for diesels  how about the feasibility
 of installing them on trucks and cars  would it be any
 different than a catylitic converter  i would assume easier
 since we are removing particulate matter instead of converting
 gasses  let us hear peoples opinions
 
 
vw and mercedes have tinkered with particulate traps  also vw
uses a kind of turbocharger on their jetta ecodiesel that helps
reduce particulates as well although i do not know the
mechanics of it
 
many diesel carsbusses and trucks in europe are now being
equipped with catalysts and traps in an effort to clean up
diesel emissions already well below legal limits anyway
 
it is a shame gm had to soil the diesels reputation in
passenger cars and prevent further resource devotion to
research into making this outstandingly efficient engine even
further ahead of gas engines in emissions
 
erik

   i sure do not know what and how they measure in regards to diesel 
 motors in cars trucks and busses but i think they are probably
 measuring the wrong pollutants or at the wrong time or both

   i certainly find it offensive to drive behind a diesel bus or
 diesel truck and some diesel cars  they stink  and it is always
 rollupthewindows panic time when one comes by or ducks in front
 of me when i am driving with my family

   i do not think the combustion mixture is kept under very good
 control in diesel engines and that is why they stink  so the 
 invisible unsmellable pollutants are reduced in diesels  yeah
 well so what  someone forgot about the visible stinky kind and
 as far as i am concerned those kind are just as bad

on the subject of the upcoming new mustang

i do not put much stock in the mag rags inside information or even
ford rep quotes  the taurus was pretty much a surprise when it was
finally disclosed in it is entirety  inside information had the
taurus with a veight and rearwheel drive at one point  i would not look
for a simple repaneled mustang folks you may be cheating yourself
if you do  there is a lot of potential  ford has not released a new
car without a fourwheel is in seven years  the mustang project has been
brewing for at least four right  a fourwheel is could happen  those
modular veights are out there too  in the interest of cafe and
competition do not rule those out either   your ignorant if you do
and there are so many spy shots and artist renderings out there
who really knows what it will look like  the mach iii  doubt it
highly

the next mustang will be fords highest profile car  it attracts
way more attention than the camarofirebird because it is heritage
is more embedded in the general public  do not lie to yourself and
believe ford will forfeit that


the car magazines have printed a lot of information about the new mustang
and the consensus about what to believe in my car circle is that the 
suspension pieces and tuning will be almost identical to the current
cobra but on a stiffer body structure which will improve its behavior
after the mntwelve thunderbird cost and weight debacle ford decided 
independent rear suspension with rear wheel drive will not be tried again in 
a volume car  

the current fourninel veight will soldier on for about two years  a version of
the thirtytwo valve modular veight in the mark viii could be offered then  ford
is spending big money tooling up for twofivel and threefivel vsix engines which will
power most of their cars in the immediate future and therefore probably
do not consider volume production of three hundred hp veight engines a priority 

undisguised the car looks ok but not nearly as exciting as the new
camarofirebird i am going to  

i suspect ford will produce their car with higher quality than gm will 
achieve with the camaro firebird  the way gm loses money the temptation
to just get them out the door for the sake of positive cash flow will be 
great once demand really takes off

summary results of iisi clock modification poll
keywords iisiclockpoll

this poll was conducted to help users decide whether or not to alter their
iisi clock oscillator i have attempted to gather as many case histories as
possible to find some estimate of success and risk the number of replies
probably shows how rare this modification is but give the impression that
success rates may be higher than the previous eighty estimate twentyfour of twentyfour
machines were able to run at twentyfive mhz when no add on boards were present
this is not a scientific survey but it is the best we have to work with

thanks to all who contributed to this poll 


issues

	speed twentyfive mhz to twentysevenfive mhz appears to be the norm for machines without
		add on cards all reported machines were able to use
		twentyfive mhz as long as no add on cards were present several apple
		nubus cards were in use no machine with the nubus adapter
		was able to go faster than twentyfive mhz one was not even able to
		achieve twentyfive mhz with the nubus adapter in place
	
		at speeds of thirtytwo and thirtythree mhz the startup sound is distorted and
		hi density floppy disk problems have been reported
		
		note unless specifically listed below machines were not
			tested with a higher speed clock to failure hence
			the twentyfive mhz operational machines may well work at
			higher speeds
			
	damage one user reported pulling out the plating of one pad this was
		repaired and the machine is operational one other
		reported pulling the pin out of the original clock oscillator
		during desoldering there is one second hand report of a user
		putting a gash in the motherboard with a slipped soldering iron
		
		no reports of static discharge damage
		
		no reports of high speed operation causing damage
		
		then again i also do not have any reports from users of
		defective parachutes
		
	add on boards compatibility appears to be a problem with apple nubus
		adapters several other add on boards have been used with
		success see case histories
		
	heat sinks virtually all modified machines had a heat sink installed
		these were often the totwo hundred and twenty style power transistor type some
		used epoxy some used a dab of heat sink compound with a dab
		of cyanoacrylate glue there was also use of a clamp with a
		bolt through the hole in the motherboard
		
		
		
case histories	

all speeds are the effective cpu speed onetwo of clock oscillator all reported

 i have a four hundred and eightysixsxtwentyfive computer with a one hundred and five mg seagate ide drive and a controler  
 built into the motherboard i want to add a scsi drive a quantum prodrive  
 four hundred and twentyfivef four hundred and twentyfive mg formatted i have no documentation at all and i need your  
 help
 
 as i understand it here is the process of adding such a drive  could you  
 please tell me if i am right
 
 one buy a scsi contoler  which one i know adaptec is good but they are  
 kind of expensive  are there any good boards in the one hundred region i want  
 it to be compatible with ostwo and unix if possible  also i have seen on  
 the net that there are scsi and scsitwo drives is this true does the  
 adapter need to be the same as the drive what type of drive is the  
 quantum


i have tried others but i think that the adaptec is best value for money


 two connect the drive to the adapter via a scsi cable and the power cable
 do i have to worry about the power supply i think i have two hundred watts and  
 all i am powering are two floppies and the seagate drive


i do not think you can mix the two types of drive unless you have one of the
scsiide cards that is available  you will have to turn your ide off


 three setup the bios to recognize the drive as the second drive  what type  
 of drive is this i do not have the numbers for this drive


instructions for drive type are included with the controller  with some it may be
a type one no matter what the disk is  with others it may be a type fortyseven  i had one
controller that i had to tell the bios that no hard disk was installed

 
 four format and create partitions on the drive do i use format or fdisk i  
 think that ide drives cannot be lowlevel formatted is it the same with  
 scsi how exactly does fdisk work i have a reduced msdos fivezero manual  
 clone obliges and there is no mention of fdisk  ideally i would want  
 the drive partitioned in to two partitions d and e how do i do this


do not low level format a scsi unless you have the scsi low level format program 
first use fdisk to set the partitions then use format


 well that seems to be all is there anythiing i am forgetting 
 any help is really appreciated i am lost

 as far as set the moral tone is concerned if a community does not
 collectively want to put up with prostitution going on in front of their
 kids why should they have to  if a community does not want to see
 proliferation of drugs among their kids why should they have to

  by what right and do tell from the standpoint of the drug
dealer or prostitute what is the difference if the gun is pointed
by the local hick city council or the feds
  if something is wrong it is wrong period if it is not
sustainable at a federal level why should it be ok just because
the geographical unit is smaller


peter nelson posted a very eloquent response to this point in 
talkpoliticsmisc so i need not consume more bandwidth here



 the problem with the egalitarian view is that it tries to deny the
 fundamental dilemma of democratic government  the people have a right
 to exercise a voice in their community yet individuals have the right
 to be left to themselves  this is a serious dilemma precisely because
 there is not much that takes place in a vacuum

  you are seriously misusing the word egalitarian you should
look the word up before you use it there is a vast difference
between equal justice under the law and egalitarianism

what i meant if it was not clear was the intersection set of liberal
and libertarian philosophies of natural rights and how the government
and constitutional interpretation in particular fits into that 
philosophy  this philosophy engages in the very serious practical 
error of endowing the nine lawyers on the supreme court with an almost 
totalitarian authority completely outside of the consent or consensus 
of the people  this is why supreme court nominations are such amazing
political fistfights these days because he who controls the court
rules the country  the people on the court may well be trying to do
the best job they can but they are at best a benevolent oligarch even
if you approve of every supreme court decision ever  eventually an
oligarch will arise that will decimate that which you hold dear  try 
supreme court cases by jury and the problem would be mitigated a great 
deal

those who would create broad nonenumerated government powers at any 
level as in european parlamentary democracies and the current defacto
standard in the yous have essentially engaged in the same fundamental 
mistake except that it is some different body that has the totalitarian 
virtually unchecked except by plurality election death or retirement 
government power 


  and why should your community be allowed to stop my activities
when i am not picking your pocket or defrauding you just because
you do not like it because you find it morally repugnant 

this is like asking why the wind blows unless you can prove that
the fact of your engaging in certain activities has absolutely no 
effect whatsoever on any other human being who has not consented to
your engagement in those activities  very few human activities indeed
fit into this category  

even for those few that do who would you empower to make the judgement 
of what is and is not a fully autonomous activity  who defines picking 
my pocket and defrauding  are economic assets a persons only assets
or are peace of mind stability confidence in a childs emotional 
environment security and many other things not also a part of a persons
assets  what gives you the right to create a moral environment that a
parent strongly objects to  what gives you the right to create an 
environment of social unrest and instability  if you say that what you
do does not have those effects by what authority do you say that  who
is empowered to make these value judgements


how 
would you feel if i got a gang together and found xtianity
or insert your favorite because here morally repugnant and
passed laws to outlaw its free exercise all at a local
level since that seems to be aok with you


if the federal constitution explicitly prohibited you from doing so the 
federal government would prevent you from doing so  if it did not and
you could muster enough local support to pass an amendment to the local
constitution by say a threefour majority empowering the local government 
to do so then i would have to vote with my feet and move to a neighborhood
more friendly to my own system of values  this is not an ideal situation
but it is far better than the mess we are mired in right now


 as to the gang of pitchfork and torch wielding friends there are very
 few restrictive local laws that i personally would advocate or vote for
 since i am of the view that exercising government power over your neighbors
 should be done with extreme care and only when absolutely necessary  but
 i do believe in protecting children from victimization by people who have
 callous disregard for the effects they have on others  i would certainly
 leave a wellbehaved massage parlor alone so long as it had no
 detrimental effects on the neighborhood

  you just do not get it the debate is not whether you or a
communitity would or would not vote away my rights it is
the propriety of whether that should even be an option

when you define rights very broadly there is no practical choice about 
whether people will or will not infringe upon your rights since these
rights overlap  even when rights are defined very narrowly the government 
has been empowered to prevent others from infringing on your rights  the 
fundamental question is by whose authority is that power created  if you 
support the current situation with a natural rights supreme court rather
than an original understanding supreme court or even better supreme
court by jury you are consenting to having nine lawyers in washington 
dc create those powers out of the air  in my fractal federalism scenario 
it is a broad consensus of the people ie the amendment process that 
creates those powers


 certainly not the only because mike but people in a local neighborhood
 should have a voice in what goes on in that neighborhood  to deny this
 is to create another concentrated centralized power to keep the locality
 from abusing its power

   you mean that horrific centralized power the individual

no i mean the federal government that comes trucking in with guns to
tell the locals how to run their neighborhood  waco tx is a nice example



 in essence using a pit bull to keep a toy poodle
 from biting your leg  chances are the pit bull is going to turn on you
 some day and you have much less defense against it than you do against
 the toy poodle  ideally everyone would leave everyone else alone and
 no government coercive power of any kind would be necessary  this will
 never work because people are different and by their nature they will
 always want to force their views on others  if this were not the case
 nobody would try to force their view that murder is wrong on anyone else

  fine when they force their views on others prosecute them
until then leave them alone this is such a simple concept
how do you feel about speech codes hate speech certainly
could be considered an indication that the pit bull is
going to turn some day should the community be allowed
to limit it too if not why not

if you create a community where public masturbation is permitted in the 
because of personal autonomy have you done anything different  what
precisely are these autonomous activities you are referring to  if you
list them perhaps we can get enough people to agree that they are truly
autonomous and pass a constitutional amendment protecting them



  and how do you feel about david koresh did he deserve
it should the batf or a local version of same be allowed
to toss him in jail just because they think he is off
his rocker

the koresh incident appears to be a horrendous abuse of government power
power possibly illegitimately obtained through a means i would abolish 
the constitutionality of noknock warrants seems very dubious to me not
to mention the mere existence of batf and the governments propensity to 
ignore the word infringe in the second amendment  this power is upheld 
by the same body with its incredible concentration of power in the hands 
of nine people that has upheld much socalled civil rights read affirmative 
action legislation despite the fourteenth amendment



   who said anything about the public till get rid of it and
 get out of my face
 

 i agree about getting rid of the public till  are you still sure you do not
 want to come over for coffee  you might not especially like my neighborhood
 and i might not especially like yours but at least we can agree to let each
 other live the kind of life we want to

  at the point you get rid of the public till you lose all
credibility as to why you should have a say about my private
affairs are you sure you are ready for that


money is certainly not the only asset i have in this world  if it were
this would be a bleak existence indeed

subject the armenians did not form a distinct race
replyto serazumauucp serdar argic
distribution world
lines one hundred and fortyseven

in article  eerginelunixamherstedu erdem erginel writes

my question is given so many separations in the armenian community what
was the common denominator of the armenian people that allowed armenian
nationalism to emerge in the nineteenth century as i stated religion

there are various contradictory views on the origin of the armenians
the name is to be found in the darian inscriptions in the form armina
or aramaniya is to be found in the inscription on the bistun monument
the following references to the armenians are to be found in the bistun
cuneiform inscription of dara vishdasb five hundred and ten bc

 one the monarch dara said i sent my servant to arminam armeniya

 six on reaching arminam armeniya

 seven to the country town of zozo to armaniya armeniya

according to karakashian

as for armenia the equivalent of the armin or arminik of the persians
this is more recent than the word ararat and is to be found used in
the dara inscriptions for haiastan  

saint martin

the name armenie has been given since very early times by almost all
the various eastern peoples to the territory referred to by the armenians
as haiastan it was known to the syrians as armenia and to the arabs
as ermeniyye
 
others believe that urartu was known in the time of the medes as harminap
which was later modified by the persians to arminia ar refers to a
place as in ararat archish aruyr archar arshav arazen and aror 
while men is used to refer to spirit thought or human being and 
therefore armen would appear to signify the people of that place

g alishan believes that according to our national vocabulary haik
is the diminutive form of hai and that hai is the name of our
nation our nation is in no way connected with the word armen that
foreigners apply to our people

it would thus appear that armenia is a placename that armen is 
the name of the people who lived there and that these are in no way
connected with the word hai

haik and haiastan

armenian historians believe haik to have been a great hero from whom
the armenian people took the name hai but the mere resemblance
between the words haik and hai constitutes no real proof and
in any case no such theory appears before the time of moses of
khoren

haiasa

the following studies show quite clearly that hai and haiasa were
no more than general names used by the hittites to refer to the 
region known as armenia

professor hachadurian haiasa was the general name used in hittite
inscriptions for upper armenia

yensen in his hittites and armenians tries to prove that hai is
identical with the hittite hatio in other words that hai is a
hittite word research however has proved this erroneous and shown
that hai was derived from hatio

mortmans attempt to read the urartu inscriptions as armenian met with 
no success as for greek there is no point in even mentioning it

the resemblance between the words haiasa and haiastan is so obvious
that we may well accept haiasa as the oldest form of haiastan

let us now cast a brief glance on how the words hai haikazan and
haiastan entered our older works

according to karakashian 

the word haik is never to be found employed with reference to a
leader of the armenian people prior to moses of khoren nor is it
ever found employed in the forms haika or haykazn

agahangelos and puzant use the word as a title or a placename he
improved and developed haiastan etc if the word had referred
to a nation and had been derived from hai or haik they could 
also have used the words haikak and haykazn in a number of
places

according to professor sayce who deciphered a number of hittite 
inscriptions

in the hittite language the suffix ha is used to specify quality
or species the words haddanas haddina were used by the 
assyrians to refer to the hittites with the transformation of the
d between the two a letters to y hadinasdani was in this
way transformed to haiastan

professor grechmer fully agrees with this point of view but regards
the significance and explanation so far accorded to the terms hai
and haistan as quite unsatisfactory he finds however that a 
solution to this problem is brought nearer by the name haiasa 
which is so frequently found in bogazkoy from one thousand four hundred bc onwards
forrer takes haiasa as referring to upper armenia in that case
it seems likely that haiasa was actually a part of armenia the
suffix dan is of anatolian origin the real root is hayasa which
refers to the country of the hayasas

e chantre writes as follows on the subject of the ethnological 
and anthropological characteristics of the armenian people

the armenians in russia may be characterized as follows almost
all of them are brachycephalic or leptocephalic very dark
above average height an aissores asian group with close ties
with certain kurdish tribes and azerbaijan peoples

according to j deniker

from the philological point of view the armenian and kurds may be
regarded as belonging to the iranian groupthe armenians are 
descended from various elements and from a very mixed race their
average height varies between onesixtythree and onesixtynine according to the region
they are almost always shortheaded with skull measurements of 
eightyfiveeightyseven as a race they belong to the indoafghanassyrianturkic
family

professor rene vernont writes as follows

the armenians are a mixture of semites turk kurds and mongols
but some of them display armenian features eg height a little
above average fair complexion dark hair dark eyes very often
a hooked nose and a rather wide mouth 

investigations carried out by n kossovitch on the links between
armenian blood groups and their anthropological characteristics
led him to the conclusion that the armenians did not form a 
distinct race

both of my senators and my rep  i also called the white house
comment line was on hold for eightten minutes so maybe lots of people
are calling  please call your congress critterwh comment line now
 
 	just a general note i have seen several polls lately and they
 show a large majority a thinks that this incident was handled ok and
 b thinks that the fbi and batf gave them more than enough time fiftyone days
 to come out

i take it that when something happens that is wrong it is okay if
a bunch of people say it is  for instance if some people go on a
murderous rampage and lynch some blacks and then a poll is taken which
shows that the majority of people think that this is acceptable then
does this mean that what these people have done is not bad  this is an
example of mob rule not a democracya democracy in which peoples
rights are protected  i hope that i have made myself clear on this

make the following points

 one your outrage over todays behaviour
 
 	and what if i am not outraged

fineyou have the right to hold any opinion that you want to  but
let me ask you this  are you outraged over this tragedy  i hope
that you are your opinions of david koresh and his followers not
withstanding  i know i am

 two since batf chief higgens and janet reno were the two who signed off
    on this plan demand that they be fired
 
 	actually they should both be commended

why  i would be interested in hearing your reasons

 five point out that even if the fire was set by someone inside of the
    building it came as a direct result of the actions of the fbibatf
    and the people inside including seventeen children deserved a trial instead
    of this
 
 	what i want to know is what exactly did you expect them to do  i
 can see it nowthe eleven of the clock news  fbi and batf agents still
 surround the waco compound after four hundred and fiftyone days  i do not think so  they gave
 them every chance  they had fiftyone days to surrender to proper authorities
 they had attornies representing them etc  koresh lied time and time again
 i do not wish them dead but you cannot let it stalemate forever  it was time
 to do something and the fbi and batf did  what happened was unfortunate
 but acceptable as long as the fbi did not set the fire intentionally

i think that everything else being equal it is not too much to ask that
if a weeknight game can be shortened by halfanhour by cutting out warmup
pitches dawdling outside the batters box commercial timeouts and that
sort of thing i am not asking for too much

how do you know they can be shortened by halfanhour  has anybody done a
study to determine how much time is actually wasted  say in these as
games

oh probably

ms nichols has given the average game times and average runs scored for
one thousand nine hundred and eightythree and one thousand nine hundred and ninetytwo  a very nice piece of information ms nichols  who knows
she may be listening and not have me in her kill file after all  those
numbers indicate somewhere in the neighborhood of halfarun less being
scored per game and the games taking fifteen minutes longer  something is
being done now that was not done ten years ago which is extending the games
by fifteen minutes  ms nichols thinks it is more pitches  given the increasing
specialization of pitchers it would not surprise me

if it is not simply more pitches though i do not think it is unreasonable
to think that something can be done to get ten of those minutes back  then
i get a couple more from shortening the warmup time for a relief pitcher
after he comes in and a couple more still from enforcing existing rules
which have been stated in other posts in this thread and other related ones

the problem is who decides whether that time is wasted  you do not seem
to think it is at all  right now i think it is although i have heard one
case favoring giving the reliever all the warmups he thinks he needs the
difference in mounds between the field and pen  but who knows  if the
rules get changed maybe something i did not foresee will happen to change my
mind  but you can bet a lot of minds would fail to foresee the same thing
or else nothing will be changed

greetings recmotorcyclists

coming up labour day weekend this year worldcon world science fiction
convention will be held in san francisco california  i am planning
to attend and have been speculating on doing my trip there by motorcycle
instead of by plane as was my initial thought 

i live and would be departing from ottawa ontario canada

i had planned to take two weeks for this trip giving me five days travel
time on either side of the weekend

this looks like a distance of about two thousand eight hundred miles four thousand five hundred km

if your distance calc is correct for an on the road distance and not
as the crow flies this is nine hundredkm a day for five days  if you spend the
entire time on interstates which would be a total waste of time that is
at least eight hours on the road every day not including eatingpeeing
sightseeing etc

i was contemplating a similar trip but from ottawa to la or
maybe ottawa to austin tx  

i figured if i want to do a trip of this magnitude and enjoy it i would
have to get my ass off the major interstates and spend lots of
time enjoying the country around me ie stopping with a camera
meeting townspeople going to a few bars  no sense spending two weeks
looking out a helmet with the closest human contact found at the gas
pump

i estimated i would need at least fourfive weeks to make the trip worthwhile

i am looking for input opinions comments or snarky remarks on
one my sanity

in question eight

two suggested routes  note getting there is important and my
   schedule does not leave a lot of room for side trips or circuitous
   routes

try and stay off the interstates

five anybody who wants to join me on this trip  for even part of the
   distance

depending on your route and my plans i may be heading that way as far
as at least detroit

seven anything that comes to mind and that you think might be relevant


call the whithorse pess  they are a book distributer catering to
motorcyclists  they have a large number of books highlighting
the best roads for motorcyclists along the general route
you are looking at  they carry listings of bed and breakfasts
all through the states which accept motorcyclists  order their free
catalog and within you will probably find books covering absolutely
all you needs for this trip  their s in the motorcyclist andor
cycle world classifieds

thanks for any input

subject update  back to the moon bill
xsender newtout zeroeight feb twentythree one thousand nine hundred and ninetythree
lines fiftyone

          introducing the back to the moon in congress
                          the next step
                          
        the next key hurdle for the lunar resources data purchase 
act is introduction of the act in congress at this point  many
congresspersons have been approached about the bill however
for a successful effort to pass the bill we need the best
possible congressperson to introduce the bill due to his
position as chair of the house committee on space and science
congressman george brown is the logical choice he has a long
record of support and interest in space development and helped
pass the launch services purchase act and the space settlements
act                      
        there is a small group of activists in southern california 
who have assisted george brown in his recent reelection campaigns
we are mobilizing this group to have them tell congressman brown
about the back to the moon bill we are also asking prospace
constituents to let him know that they care about getting
america back to the moon
        finally there is a good chance that a nationwide alert 
for space activists to call or write george brown to have him
introduce the back to the moon bill may be staged during late
spring one thousand nine hundred and ninetythree
        all this should produce a positive reaction from browns
office as more is known it will be passed on
        however even if we are successful in getting him to support
the bill  this alone will not ensure passage of the bill for
any bill to become law one of three conditions must exist
either the bill must reflect widespread national support for an
issue such as extension of unemployment insurance benefits be
propelled by highpriced lobbyists we are out of luck there or
have widespread support within congress due to small but
widespread constituent support the latter is the path that we
by necessity must choose                    
        this means that the introduction of the lunar resources 
data purchase act must be immediately accompanied by a large number
of congresspersons sponsorship of the bill  to accomplish
this we need activists to ask their congressperson to support
the lunar resources data purchase act  now to wait until the
bill is introduced is simply too late  it takes time to have a
congresspersons staff review a bill
        if your congressperson mentions that the bill is not yet
introduced please elicit their opinion of the bill as currently
written we appreciate all comments on the bill from activists
and politicians
        if you have yet to see the back to the moon bill please
request a copy by email please include your yous postal service
address or contact your local chapter of the national space
society

wood played most of his junior career in seattle  he was one
of the leading scorers on a mediocre team when he was traded away in
one thousand nine hundred and ninetytwo  he rarely lost a fight and was one of the toughest players in
the whl
 
 wood is fairly small for an enforcertype i mean fleury does a pretty good
 job and is not that large but dody is no fleury 

and fleury is no enforcer an agitator for sure but fleury never has and never
will have a fight which seems to be what you are saying wood is 

the closest fleury ever came to fighting was a game two years ago against
los angeles there was a scrum and mcsorley pinched fleurys head under his
arm fleury dropped his gloves and gave mcsorley a weak shot to the side of the
head mcsorely knowing a good thing when he saw one popped fleury one right
between the eyes end of fight fleury got ten stitches for his trouble

the only player i can ever see theo fighting is cliff ronning and even then
he would be giving up two inches and tenfifteen pounds
