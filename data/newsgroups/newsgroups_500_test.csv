i would be willing to go in as well by the way we would not need to
buy the network wholesale simply owning a large number of shares
would still work if five of the shareholders want progun coverage
and the rest do not really care they will go along just to keep 
the five happy

i would go along with this plan as well  turners stock is traded
on the american exchange and has three classes a b and c  a and
b stock is currently about twentythree bucks a share c stock is about eleven
bucks a share  does anybody have any idea how much stock tbs
has issued  what would it take to reach five fiftyone or even one hundred

um i sortof hesitate to bring this up but owning even a single share
entitles you to attend the annual shareholders meeting and under most
corporate charters to introduce topics to be discussed  while i do not
suggest the tactic used by some in japan go to the shareholders meeting
and disrupt the bejeezus out of everything what about a wellworded

this issue has been going on for a while and your presentation here of
just one reference probably will not resolve this issue to those that
oppose your insistence that mosques were destroyed even in your
location of this one reference you spend most of your quote dealing
with an incidence that while abhorrant has nothing to do with the 
issue at hand here then at the end of the quote there is an almost
offhand comment that two mosques were destroyed

to support a claim of this nature what other authors support this
incident if identifiable mosques were destroyed they are certainly
identifiable they have names and addresses steet location the
comment by one reporter does make us wonder if this happened but
by no means proves it

there is no doubt that israeli authorities ordered the destruction of
mosques in the vicinity of the wailing wall that does not mean
however that once can generalize from this to any other points  the
entire plaza mosques and all was cleared to make it possible for jews
to have a place to worship in the place that was holiest to many of
them and which had been denied to them for millenia

on the other hand throughout the rest of jerusalem and israel to the
best of my knowledge israeli authorities have scrupulously avoided
damage to any islamic religious sites this contrasts with the policies
of previous regimes which destroyed jewish synagogues out of hate and
bigotry

   of course they are working on the theory that candida
 overbloom with penetration into mucus membrane tissue with

 in a large number of people  if you reject this yeast 
 hypothesis then i would guess you would view this research as one
 more wasteful and quixotic endeavor  stay tuned

i do not have enough medical expertise to have much of an opinion
one way or another on hidden candida infections  i can
understand the skepticism of those who see this associated with
various general kinds of symptoms while there is a lack of solid
demonstration that this happens and causes such general symptoms
to understand this skepticism one only needs to know of past
failures that shared these characteristics with the notion of
hidden candida infection  there have been quite a few and the
proponents of all thought that the skeptics were overly skeptical

on the other hand i am happy to read that some people are
sufficiently interested in this possibility spurred by
suggestive clinical experience to research it further  the
doubters may be surprised  it has happened before

i realize that admitting ignorance in the face of ignorance may
not endear me to those who are so sure they know one way or
another  and indeed perhaps some of them do know  i am the
one who is currently ignorant  but i find this the most honest

 only hear himself speaking in his own language

this thread si starting to get really silly such nonsense do not
belong in src and it really hurts me to read some of the posts on
this issue

we chose to believe whetever we want but we are not allowed to define
our own christianity we see in parts if you see something that i do
not see or vice versa it does not give me the right to play jokes on
your belief

there is no wonder that your miracle does not work you designet it
yourself and even if you were able to collect a group of people like
the one you describe i see no reason why your miracle should really
happen god is the one who does miracles not humans

after all we are all on the same way or at least we are all headed
for the same goal following different paths remember that we are
going to spend eternity together if i can not stand your view here on
earth how can i possibly stand spending eternity together with you

tongues is a question of belief not wether you believe in jesus but
if you believe that he is able to give you this gift just as any
other of the gifts mentioned in the bible but there is no evidence in
the bible that people who do not accept these gifts are in any way
better than others

 perhaps i would believe the gifted ones more if they were
 glorifying god rather than themselves then perhaps we would
 witness a real miracle

maybe some of the people who have received spiritual gifts are more
interested in glorifying themselves than glorifying god i do not know
but if this is the case it still does not suggest that the gifts are
faked

in the bible you will find that jesus did not always do miracles he
said that i do nothing except what my father tells me perhaps it
woulkd be for the best of all if we where all able to live by that
example

result that human beings are not held responsible for their own
actions  i will answer how you deal with this in a minute

   the catholic doctrine of predestination does not exclude free will in
any way  since god knows everything he therefore knows everything that
is going to happen to us  we have free will and are able to change
what happens to us  however since god knows everything he knows all
the choices we will make in advance god is not subject to time  too
often arguments pit predestination against free will  we believe in

lines ninetyone
nntppostinghost vmsocomokstateedu
organization osu college of osteopathic medicine

in article  ashwinagatechedu ashwin ram writes
 our twentymonth son has started falling sick quite often every since he
 started going to day care  he was at home for the first year and he did
 not fall sick even once  now it seems like he has some sort of cold or
 flu pretty much once a month  most of the time the cold leads to an ear
 infection as well with the result that he ends up being on antibiotics
 three weeks out of four  i know kids in day care fall sick more often but we
 are beginning to wonder how often more often really is whether our
 son is more susceptible or has lower immunity than average 
 are there any studies that can help answer some of these questions

when kids stayed in the home until kindergarden or onest grade infection 
incidence was much lower because exposure was lower  some studies suggest 
that early exposure to various infectious diseases is probably beneficial 
because exposure as an adult carries much more risk of morbitity and 
mortalitymumps measles etc

  how often do kids in their first second and third years fall sick
 how often do they get colds flus ear infections  is there any data on
 home care vs day care

daycare will always carry a higher exposure risk than home care

  does being sick build immunity leading to less illness later
 does it make kids weaker leading to more illness later or does it
 not have any long term effect

exposure to infectious organisms does build immunity  but many viruses 
mutate and reexposure to the new strain requires another immune response
new antibody production  in addition antibody levels tend to decline 
with time and reinnoculation is needed to keep the antibody levels high
chronic overstimulation of the immune response can lead to immunosupression 
but this is rare and very unlikely to occur in children

  does taking antibiotics on a regular basis have any negative long
 term effects

yes chronic use of antibiotics can have an adverse effect on the good 
bacteria that are supposed to be present in and on the body  health effects 
of this depletion of the good bacteria is a very hotly debated topic in the 
medical community with most physicians seeming to discount any health effects 
of chronic antibiotic use a view that i do not support
 
  how does one tell if a child is more susceptible to illness than
 normal and what does one do about it

chronic infection in an adult or a child needs to be worked up in my 
opinion  but most physicians feel that chronic infection in a child is 
normal because of both exposure and lack of prior immunity to many 
infectious diseases  i do not share this view and there are some 
physicians who also suspect that diet plays a big role in infection 
frequency and severity  exposure to an infectious agent does not have to 
result in a severe infection  a strong immune response can minimize the 
length of time needed to deal with the infection as well as the symptoms 
associated with the infection

  is there any way to build immunity and resistance

there are five major nutrients that are responsible for a good strong 
immune response to infectious agents  they are protein vitamin c 
vitamin a iron and zinc  the american diet is not low in protein so this 
is rarely a problem  but vitamin a vitamin c iron and zinc are often low 
and this lack of an adequate poolnutrient reserve can impair the immune 
response  iron is know to be low in most kidsas is vitamin a  there are 
distinct biochemical tests that can be run to check the status of each of 
these nutrients in a patient who is having a problem with chronic severe 
infection  serum ferritin for iron status dark adaptation for vitamin a 
status red blood cell zinc for zinc status and leckocyte ascorbate for 
vitamin c status  i have attempted to work up posts on these five 
nutrients and their role in infection for this news group as well as the 
others that i participate in  i can email you what i have worked up so far
but my best advice to you is to try to find a physician who recognizes the 
critical role that diet plays in the human immune response  you may also 
be able to get help from a nutritionist  anyone can call themselves a 
nutritionist so you have to be very carefull  you want to find someone
like myself who has had some formal training and education in nutrition
many phd programs in the yous now offer degrees in nutrition and that is 
what you need to look for  some dieticians will also call themselves 
nutritionists but most dieticians have not had the biochemical training 
needed to run specialized nutritional assessment tests  they are very good 
for getting general dietary advice from however

 any data information or advice relating to this would be much
 appreciated  thanks a lot

against the greeks during the period of time greece was occupied by the
turks  now you expect that turks living in greece should be treated like

so the greek educational system is also in a shambles history shows 
that within the last one hundred and seventy years greeks played that game twice they 
used istanbul patriarch grigorios in one thousand eight hundred and twentytwo to instigate the morea 
rebellion that resulted in the massacres of the muslim people again 
the orthodox patriarch constantine v invited the russian czar nicholas

  the disintegration of the ottoman empire which had been going on
  for a century was disastrous for ottoman jewry this was the age of
  nationalism among the christian subjects of the sultan starting with
  the greek revolution early in the nineteenth century which based on
  the megali idea or great idea sought to add to greek kingdom istanbul
  and large portions of anatolia union of which with greece was felt to be
  the dream and hope of all the success of the greek national movement
  provided more in fact by the intervention of the great powers than by the
  efforts of the greeks themselves stimulated similar uprisings among the
  other subjects in southeastern europe who had long been oppressed not so
  much by the ottomans but rather by the greek religious hierarchy which
  dominated the orthodox millet leading first to pressure for religious
  independence granted to the bulgarian orthodox exarchate in one thousand eight hundred and seventy to the
  serbian church in one thousand eight hundred and seventynine and to the rumanian church in one thousand eight hundred and eightyfive with subsequent
  aspirations for and achievement of political independence following

  page one hundred and eightyeight

  they new nationalist leaders were greatly assisted in their
   campaigns against the ottomans both by the diplomatic and consular
   representatives of the major powers of europe and also by christian
   missionaries who emphasized feelings of christian superiority and
   hatred for muslims and jews which fortified the religious as well as
   ethnic bases of their pursuit of independence

   christian nationalism based as much on religious as on ethnic identity
   soon resurrected the medieval bigotries which had devastated both jews
   and muslims and consequently had driven them together in the past
   vicious antimuslim and antisemitic movements developed involving
   largescale persecutions and massacres carried out by invading armies
   by the independent states that resulted also by christian subjects
   who remained within the empire particularly because of jewish and muslim
   support for ottoman integrity in fear of their fate in the emergent
   nationalist states of southeastern europe the results were explosive
   and damaging

   the invading armies of russia and austria as well as the revolting
   nationalists and later successfully established independent christian
   states committed systematic genocide against jews and muslims throughout
   the nineteenth century despite great power admonitions to the contrary
   in the treaties of paris one thousand eight hundred and fiftyeight and berlin one thousand eight hundred and seventyeight

  page one hundred and eightyeight

  as the peoples of southeastern europe achieved their independence
   their muslim and jewish minorities were systematically persecuted and
   massacred and those who survived were driven beyond the evershrinking
   boundaries of the retreating ottoman empire in a kind of slaughter which
   had not been seen since the dispersal of the jews from palestine centuries
   earlier

   this sort of genocide had begun as long before as the late sixteenth
   century with the rumanian principalities taking the lead as united
   rumania did subsequently during the later years of the nineteenth
   century in one thousand five hundred and seventynine the ruler of moldavia peter the lame banished its
   jews because of their competition with its christian merchants when
   prince micheal the brave revolted against the ottomans in the rumanian
   principalities of wallachia and moldavia in one thousand five hundred and ninetythree he ordered the massacre
   of all the jews as well as turks in bucharest

recently i have come upon a body of literature which promotes colon
cleansing as a vital aid to preventive medicine through nutrition  in
particular dr bernard jenssen in his book colon cleansing for
health and longevity  the title actually escapes me but it is very
similar to that  claims that regular selfadministered colonics
along with certain orally ingested debrisloosening agents boosts
the immune system to a significant degree

he also plugs a unique appliance called the colema board which
facilitates the selfadministration of colonics  it sells for over
one hundred from a californiabased company  he also plugs vitratox
products as his chemical agents of choice these include volcanic ash
supposedly for its electrical charge and psyllium powder for its
bulkiness

if anyone knows anything about colon cleansing theory its
particulars or the colema board and related products i would be very
interested to hear about research and personal experience

i am curious to know if christians ever read books based on critique
on the religion classical text such as age of reason by paine
or the myth maker by jacobi sometimes it is good to know your
enemy and if you want to do serious research you have to understand
both sides and not solely the one and only right one

yes one does  i examined a critique of the book of romans by
i think benjamin franklin once a deist  i found it amazing that
benjamin franklin missed the whole boat   i also have the writings
on thomas jefferson sitting on my shelf and it is amazing how
much he missed  i have studied platos theory of forms and 
aristotelian hylomorphesism  what a pile of junk  jesus
makes plato and aristotle look like kindergardeners  psychology
the id ego superego by freud  elements of truth but jesus
explained it far better and gave reasons

thomas paine benjamin franklin thomas jefferson are mere men  they
can screw up the bible just as well as any man  i do not put these
men on a pedestal  and if i remember tjs autobiography correctly
he thought thomas paine was the most unread man he ever met

here is some more circular reasoning to you  paul says to the corinthians
that that the gospel will be foolishness to the world because it is 
spiritually discerned  and so people without the spirit of god have not a
clue to what the bible is saying   from your point of view that is
incredibly circular and convenient   to me it is mysteriously and supernaturally
bizarre   i can see it but you cannot  this is not arrogance on
my part  trust me  it is as bizarre to you as it is to me  but nonetheless
it is a truth explainable or not

are any of you color blind to red and green  i am  remember those
dot tests they do at the optomologists  they put pictures in front
of you and you are supposed to identify the pattern in the dots  if
your eyes are perfectly normal you can see letters or numerals
embedded in the dots  they are a slightly different color and stand
out from the background  but if you are color blind to red and green
you will not see anything but grayshaded dots  that is how a dot
test appears to me  i do not see a pattern at all

a normal seeing person will see the patterns  and to him i seem like a
total anomaly  to him i appear as if i am missing the universe or something
it is hard for him to understand why i cannot see anything
that to him is as plain as day

that it what it is like with the bible the word of god to the believer
the believer can see the meaning in the words  i can see how the patterns
fit together  there is such depth  such consistency   but then on the
other hand i notice the nonbeliever   he does not see it  he thinks
i am weird because he thinks i am seeing things   i look at him and
say no you are weird  you do not see   then it is time for a sanity
check  i go to another christian and say do you see this  and
they go yes  it is an x  and i say thank god i see the x
too

it is truly the strangest thing   it adds a little extra dimension to
the phrase 

         he will make the blind see and the deaf hear

could see what they are missing

 bbc world news service on shortwave originating out of london
 reports that a survivor of the waco massacre states that a tank when
 making a hole in the wall of the building knocked over a kerosene
 lamp and that is how the fire started  attempts were made by the
 people inside to put out the fire but it spread too quickly
 
 we are hearing it  it sure rings true it is consistent in a way that
 mass suicide by fire is not  this survivor is also saying that they
  
 it rings true
 
 there was a separate report that an overhead helicopter which was recording
 the entire incident on video tape has a visual record of several files
 i think the number three was mentioned starting at different parts of the
 compound

has this video been made public  the fbi spokesman also said they 
first knew of the fire when black smoke started pouring out but
later said that three different fbi agents saw bd members starting
the fires

also the fbi claims to have listening devices bugs in the compound  
will they make public the tapes of what the bd said

 to me this attempt to blame the fbi for starting the fire simply looks
 like an attempt by a survivor to shift blame away from the bds
 
 i think it is a crock

well sealing the initial search warrent keeping the media miles away
not letting the bd talk to the public making contradictory statements
not releasing the vidio  tapes are not steps to ensure public confidence 
in their actions

all our local experts say it is the tappits that need some adjusting so
i am soon to attempt that  i would like any advice anyone had 

if this is the same as adjusting the shims between cam and valve i have
the same question  do you buy a full set of shims before starting the
adjustment process or do you calculate the shims you need and then run
off to the dealer in the cage to see if the right shims are in stock 
obviously the latter would be cheaper what do shims cost but are
measurements of the shim need reliable enough to buy only the indicated shims

much deleted 
point today might be the masons  just a note that they too worshipped 
osiris in egypt
much deleted 

     it bugs me when i see this kind of nonsense

     first there is no reasonable evidence linking masonry to ancient
egypt or even that it existed prior to the late fourteenth century and
there is nothing definitive before the seventeenth

i am going to cut rexs ramblings down a bit


you must not be past your twentyth level  you should read wilkinsons
egyptians and how he shows this egyptian religion paralleling his own british
masonry  there is a man here at this laboratory who is a thirtythree degree black
mason  i have talked with him 
there is the public side with motorcyle mania and
childrens hospitals and then there is the priviate side that only the highest
degree mason every learns of

   rex there are literally hundreds of thousands of thirtytwond degree
masons in this country and thousands of thirtythreerds if nasty stuff was
really going on do not you think you would have more than a couple of
disgruntled members exposing it heck if what you say is true then
rev norman vincent peale is an osiris worshiper
 

long quote from someone named hislop source not given deleted i am
attempting to extract from it the relevent points 

   osiris is actually nimrod a babylonian deity 

   it is admitted that the secret system of free masonry was originally
    founded on the mysteries of the egyptian isis the goddessmother or
    wife of osiris

   the babylonian nimrod and osiris are both connected with the building
    trade ie with masonry

   nimrod as the son of cush was a negro is not this refering to a 
    biblical nimrod rather than the babylonian god

    there was a tradition in egypt recorded by plutarch that osiris
     was black


     there is a long tradition in masonry of claiming ancient lineage
for the order on the flimsiest of grounds this dates right back to
the constitutions of one thousand seven hundred and thirtyeight which cite adam as the first mason i have
seen other claims which place masonry among the romans greeks and
egyptians and atlanteans i even have a book which claims to prove
that stonehenge was originally a masonic temple 

    claims prove nothing where is the beef rex

claims exmason showed him leopard skin he wore in lodge
 any representation of osiris usually show the wearing of some leopard

   i would have to check this the tomb paintings i remember do not show
this

  it is interesting that the druids of britian also show or should i say
 hide this representation  they however worshipped the spotted cow

   can you give ancient citations for this the druids were suppressed
over two thousand years ago what is your point

   this whole leopard skin business sounds bizarre  i have not yet
gone through the scottish rite which contains all of those higher
degrees antimasons get so excited about and which was invented in
the one thousand seven hundred and fiftys but i know enough people who have and who are good
christians that i reject your claim

i will stand by my statements  masonry is of the mystery religions
that all find their source in babylon the great harlot sorry peter
i do not mean to be a cold slap to the face but there is to much

not so much a slap in the face as a weary feeling of deja vu i am
going through a very similar argument over on soccultureafricanamerican

evidence to the contrary that masonry does not find its origins in
egypt  of the masons i have personally talked to all refered to
egypt as their origin  

    why do not you try reading some serious books on masonic history such
as hamills the craft

why are you now separating yourself from this which not many years ago
was freely admitted

   because we got honest if you can come up with actual evidence that
masonry existed prior to one thousand three hundred and ninety i would be very impressed actually
anything earlier than one thousand six hundred and thirty would be pretty good

   why does a lead acid battery discharge and become dead totally unuseable
 when stored on a concrete floor  

it could be that you stored it somewhere that it could become covered
by moisture or damp air which would short out the terminals

the same thing happens to my car citroen twocv  damp gets under the
bonnet us hood and shorts the sparkplugs to earth so it will not start

the solution for the car is to clean the plug leads and spray with
wdforty moisture repellant  if damp is the problem then storing the 
battery off the ground may help  i am not sure if spraying with wdforty
would be safe since it is very flammable high percentage petroleum

  from crossbows to cryptography  thwarting the state via
                     technology

  given at the future of freedom conference november one thousand nine hundred and eightyseven


     you   know   technologyand   particularly   computer
technologyhas often gotten a bad rap in  libertarian  cir
cles  we tend to think of orwells one thousand nine hundred and eightyfour or terry gilliams
brazil  or  the  proximity  detectors keeping east berlins
slavecitizens on their own side of the border or  the  so
phisticated  bugging  devices  nixon used to harass those on
his enemies list  or we recognize that for the price  of
a  ticket  on  the concorde we can fly at twice the speed of
sound but only if we first walk thru a magnetometer run  by
a  government  policeman and permit him to paw thru our be
longings if it beeps

     but i think that mindset is a mistake   before  there
were cattle prods governments tortured their prisoners with
clubs  and  rubber  hoses    before  there  were lasers for
eavesdropping governments used binoculars and  lipreaders
though  government certainly uses technology to oppress the
evil lies not in the tools but in the wielder of the tools

     in fact technology represents one of the most  promis
ing  avenues  available  for  recapturing our freedoms from
those who have stolen them  by its very nature  it  favors
the  bright  who can put it to use over the dull who can
not  it favors the adaptable who are  quick  to  see  the
merit  of  the  new  over  the sluggish who cling to time
tested ways  and what two better words are  there  to  de
scribe government bureaucracy than dull and sluggish

     one  of  the  clearest  classic triumphs of technology
over tyranny i see is  the  invention  of  the  manportable
crossbow   with it an untrained peasant could now reliably
and lethally engage a target out to  fifty  meterseven  if
that  target  were  a mounted chainmailed knight  unlike
the longbow which admittedly was more powerful and  could
get  off  more shots per unit time the crossbow required no
formal training to utilize   whereas the  longbow  required
elaborate  visual  tactile  and kinesthetic coordination to
achieve any degree of accuracy the wielder  of  a  crossbow
could simply put the weapon to his shoulder sight along the
arrow  itself and be reasonably assured of hitting his tar
get

     moreover since just about  the  only  mounted  knights
likely  to  visit  your  average peasant would be government
soldiers and tax collectors the utility of the  device  was
plain    with it the common rabble could defend themselves
not only against one another but against their governmental
masters   it was the  medieval  equivalent  of  the  armor
piercing  bullet  and consequently kings and priests the
medieval equivalent of a  bureau  of  alcohol  tobacco  and
crossbows  threatened  death  and  excommunication respec
tively for its unlawful possession

     looking at later developments we  see  how  technology
like  the  firearmparticularly the repeating rifle and the
handgun later followed by the gatling gun and more advanced
machine gunsradically altered the balance of interpersonal
and intergroup power  not without reason was the colt  fortyfive
called the equalizer  a frail dancehall hostess with one
in  her  possession  was  now  fully able to protect herself
against the brawniest roughneck in any saloon    advertise
ments  for  the period also reflect the merchandising of the
repeating cartridge  rifle  by  declaring  that  a  man  on
horseback  armed with one of these rifles simply cannot be
captured  and as long as his captors  were  relying  upon
flintlocks  or  singleshot rifles the quote is doubtless a
true one

     updating now to  the  present  the  publickey  cipher
with  a  personal  computer to run it represents an equiv
alent quantum leapin a defensive weapon    not  only  can
such  a technique be used to protect sensitive data in ones
own possession but it can also permit two strangers to  ex
change   information   over   an   insecure   communications
channela  wiretapped   phone   line   for   example   or
skywriting for that matterwithout ever having previously
met  to  exchange cipher keys   with a thousanddollar com
puter you can create a cipher that  a  multimegabuck  cray
xmp  cannot  crack in a year  within a few years it should
be economically feasible to similarly encrypt voice communi
cations soon after that fullcolor digitized video images
technology will not only have made wiretapping obsolete  it
will  have  totally demolished governments control over in
formation transfer

     i would like to take just a moment to sketch the  mathemat
ics  which makes this principle possible  this algorithm is
called the rsa algorithm after rivest shamir and  adleman
who  jointly created it  its security derives from the fact
that if a very large number is  the  product  of  two  very
large  primes  then it is extremely difficult to obtain the
two prime factors from analysis  of  their  product    ex
tremely  in  the  sense that if primes  p  and  q  have one hundred
digits apiece then their two hundreddigit product cannot  in  gen
eral be factored in less than one hundred years by the most powerful
computer now in existence

     the  public part of the key consists of one the prod
uct  pq  of the two large primes p and q and two  one  fac
tor  call it  x   of the product  xy  where  xy  pone 
qone  one  the private part of the key consists  of  the
other factor  y

     each  block of the text to be encrypted is first turned
into an integereither by using ascii  or  even  a  simple
aone  btwo  cthree   ztwentysix representation  this integer
is then raised to the power  x modulo pq and the resulting
integer is then sent as the encrypted message  the receiver
decrypts by taking this integer to the  secret  power    y
modulo  pq  it can be shown that this process will always
yield the original number started with

     what makes this a groundbreaking development  and  why
it  is  called  publickey  cryptography  is  that i can
openly publish the product  pq and the number   x     while
keeping  secret  the number  y  so that anyone can send me
an encrypted message namely
                       x
                     a    mod pq  
but only i can recover the original message  a   by  taking
what  they  send raising it to the power  y  and taking the
result mod pq  the risky step meeting to exchange cipher
keys has been eliminated  so people who may not even trust
each other enough to want to meet may  still  reliably  ex
change  encrypted  messageseach  party having selected and
disseminated his own  pq  and his  x     while  maintaining
the secrecy of his own  y

     another benefit of this scheme is the notion of a dig
ital signature to enable one to authenticate the source of
a given message  normally if i want to send you a message
i raise my plaintext  a  to your x and take the result  mod
your pq  and send that

    however  if in my message i take the plaintext  a and
raise it to my secret power  y   take the result  mod my
pq then raise that result to your x   mod  your  pq  and
send this then even after you have normally decrypted the
message  it  will still look like garbage  however if you
then raise it to my public power x    and take  the  result
mod  my public pq   so you will not only recover the ori
ginal plaintext message but you will know that no one but i
could have sent it to you since no one else knows my secret
y

     and these are the very concerns by the way that are to
day tormenting the soviet union about the whole question  of
personal  computers    on the one hand they recognize that
american schoolchildren are right now growing up  with  com
puters  as commonplace as sliderules used to bemore so in
fact because there are things computers can do  which  will
interest  and instruct three and fouryearolds  and it is pre
cisely these students who one generation hence will be going
headtohead against their soviet  counterparts    for  the
soviets  to  hold  back might be a suicidal as continuing to
teach swordsmanship  while  your  adversaries  are  learning
ballistics    on  the  other hand whatever else a personal
computer may be it is also an exquisitely efficient copying
machinea floppy disk will hold upwards of fiftyzero words  of
text  and  can  be  copied in a couple of minutes  if this
were not threatening enough the computer that  performs  the
copy  can also encrypt the data in a fashion that is all but
unbreakable  remember that in soviet society  publicly  ac
cessible  xerox  machines are unknown   the relatively few
copying machines in existence  are  controlled  more  inten
sively than machine guns are in the united states

     now  the  conservative position is that we should not
sell these computers to the soviets because they could  use
them  in weapons systems  the liberal position is that we
should sell them in  the  interests  of  mutual  trade  and
cooperationand  anyway  if  we do not make the sale there
will certainly be some other nation willing to

     for my part i am ready to suggest that the  libertarian
position should be to give them to the soviets for free and
if  necessary make them take them    and if that does not
work load up an srseventyone  blackbird  and  air  drop  them  over
moscow in the middle of the night  paid for by private sub
scription of course not taxation    i confess that this
is not a position that has gained much support among members
of  the conventional leftright political spectrum but af
ter all in the words of one of illuminatuss characters we
are political noneuclideans   the shortest distance  to  a
particular  goal may not look anything like what most people
would consider a straight line    taking  a  long  enough
worldview  it is arguable that breaking the soviet govern
ment monopoly on information transfer could better  lead  to
the enfeeblement and indeed to the ultimate dissolution of
the soviet empire than would the production of another dozen
missiles aimed at moscow

     but  there is  the rub  a long enough world view does
suggest that the evil the oppressive the coercive and  the
simply  stupid  will get what they deserve but what is not
immediately clear is how the rest of  us  can  escape  being
killed enslaved or pauperized in the process

    when  the  liberals and other collectivists began to at
tack freedom they possessed a reasonably  stable  healthy
functioning economy and almost unlimited time to proceed to
hamstring   and   dismantle  it    a  policy  of  political
gradualism was at least  conceivable    but  now  we  have
patchwork  crazyquilt  economy held together by baling wire
and spit  the state not only taxes us to  feed  the  poor
while also inducing farmers to slaughter milk cows and drive
up food pricesit then simultaneously turns around and sub
sidizes research into agricultural chemicals designed to in
crease  yields of milk from the cows left alive  or witness
the fact that a decline in the price of oil is considered as
potentially frightening as a comparable increase a few years
ago  when the price went up  we  were  told  the  economy
risked  collapse for for want of energy  the price increase
was called the moral equivalent of war and the feds  swung
into  action    for the first time in american history the
speed at which you drive your car to work in the morning be
came an issue of federal concern   now when the  price  of
oil  drops again we risk problems this time because ameri
can oil companies and third world  basketcase  nations  who
sell  oil  may  not  be  able to ever pay their debts to our
grossly overextended banks  the suggested panacea is  that
government  should now reraise the oil prices that opec has
lowered via a new oil tax  since the government is seeking
to raise oil prices to about the same extent  as  opec  did
what  can we call this except the moral equivalent of civil
warthe government against its own people

     and classically in international trade can you imag
ine any entity in the world except  a  government  going  to
court  claiming  that  a  vendor  was  selling  it goods too
cheaply and demanding not only that that naughty  vendor  be
compelled by the court to raise its prices but also that it
be punished for the act of lowering them in the first place

     so  while the statists could afford to take a couple of
hundred years to trash our  economy  and  our  libertieswe
certainly  cannot  count  on  having an equivalent period of
stability in which to reclaim them   i contend  that  there
exists  almost  a  black  hole  effect in the evolution of
nationstates just as in the evolution of stars  once free
dom contracts beyond a certain  minimum  extent  the  state
warps  the fabric of the political continuum about itself to
the degree that subsequent reemergence of  freedom  becomes
all but impossible  a good illustration of this can be seen
in the area of socalled welfare payments  when those who
sup  at the public trough outnumber and thus outvote those
whose taxes must replenish the trough  then  what  possible
choice has a democracy but to perpetuate and expand the tak
ing  from  the few for the unearned benefit of the many  go
down to the nearest welfare office find just  two  people
on  the dole    and recognize that between them they form
a voting bloc that can forever outvote you on  the  question
of who owns your lifeand the fruits of your lifes labor

     so essentially those who love liberty need an edge of
some  sort  if  we are ultimately going to prevail  we obvi
ously  cannot  use  the  altruists  otherdirectedness  of
work  slave suffer sacrifice so that next generation of
a billion random strangers can  live  in  a  better  world
recognize  that however immoral such an appeal might be it
is nonetheless an extremely powerful one in todays culture
if you can convince  people  to  work  energetically  for  a
because caring only enough for their personal welfare so as
to  remain  alive  enough  and  healthy  enough  to continue
workingthen you have a truly massive reservoir  of  energy
to draw from  equally clearly this is just the sort of ap
peal which tautologically cannot be utilized for egoistic or
libertarian goals  if i were to stand up before you tonight
and say something like listen follow me as i enunciate my
noble because contribute your money to support the because
give  up  your  free  time  to  work for the because strive
selflessly to bring it about and then after you  and  your
children are dead maybe your childrens children will actu
ally  live under egoismyou would all think i would gone mad  and
of course you would be right  because the point i am  trying  to
make is that libertarianism andor egoism will be spread if
when and as individual libertarians andor egoists find it
profitable andor enjoyable to do so    and  probably  only
then

     while i certainly do not disparage the concept of poli
tical  action i do not believe that it is the only nor even
necessarily the most costeffective path  toward  increasing
freedom  in  our time  consider that for a fraction of the
investment in time money and effort i might expend in  try
ing  to  convince  the  state to abolish wiretapping and all
forms of censorshipi can teach every libertarian who is in
terested  how  to   use   cryptography   to   abolish   them
unilaterally

     there  is  a  maxima proverbgenerally attributed to
the eskimoes which very likely most libertarians  have  al
ready  heard    and while you likely would not quarrel with
the saying you might well feel that you have heard  it  often
enough already and that it has nothing further to teach us
and moreover that maybe you are even tired of hearing it  i
shall therefore repeat it now

     if you give a man a fish the saying runs you feed him
for a day  but if you teach a man how to fish you feed him
for a lifetime

     your exposure to the quote was probably in some sort of
a  workfare  vs  welfare  context  namely that if you
genuinely wish to help someone in need you should teach him
how to earn his sustenance not simply how to  beg  for  it
and of course this is true if only because the next time he
is hungry there might not be anybody around willing or even
able to give him a fish whereas with the information on how
to fish he is completely self sufficient

     but  i  submit  that this exhausts only the first order
content of the quote and if there were nothing  further  to
glean  from  it  i would have wasted your time by citing it
again  after all it seems to have almost a cryptoaltruist
slant as though to imply that we should structure  our  ac
tivities  so  as  to  maximize  the  benefits to such hungry
beggars as we may encounter

     but consider

     suppose this eskimo does not know how to  fish  but  he
does  know  how  to hunt walruses   you on the other hand
have often gone hungry while traveling thru  walrus  country
because  you  had  no idea how to catch the damn things and
they ate most of the fish you could catch  and now  suppose
the  two  of  you  decide to exchange information bartering
fishing knowledge for hunting knowledge   well  the  first
thing  to  observe  is  that  a  transaction  of  this  type
categorically and unambiguously refutes the marxist  premise
that  every  trade  must  have a winner and a loser the
idea that if one person gains it must necessarily be at the
expense of another person who loses  clearly under  this
scenario such is not the case  each party has gained some
thing  he  did  not have before and neither has been dimin
ished in any way  when it comes to exchange of  information
rather  than material objects life is no longer a zerosum
game  this is an extremely powerful notion   the  law  of
diminishing   returns   the  first  and  second  laws  of
thermodynamicsall those laws which constrain our possi
bilities in other contextsno longer bind us   now  that is
anarchy

     or  consider  another possibility  suppose this hungry
eskimo never learned  to  fish  because  the  ruler  of  his
nationstate    had  decreed fishing illegal   because fish
contain dangerous tiny bones and sometimes sharp spines he
tells us the state has decreed that their  consumptionand
even  their  possessionare  too  hazardous to the peoples
health to be permitted    even by knowledgeable  willing
adults   perhaps it is because citizens bodies are thought
to be government property and therefore it is the  function
of the state to punish those who improperly care for govern
ment  property    or perhaps it is because the state gener
ously extends to competent adults the benefits it provides
to children and to the mentally ill  namely  a  fulltime
allpervasive supervisory conservatorshipso that they need
not  trouble  themselves  with making choices about behavior
thought physically risky or morally naughty  but in  any
case  you  stare stupefied while your eskimo informant re
lates how this law is taken so seriously that  a  friend  of
his was recently imprisoned for years for the crime of pos
session of nine ounces of trout with intent to distribute

     now  you  may  conclude  that  a society so grotesquely
oppressive as to enforce a law of this  type  is  simply  an
affront to the dignity of all human beings  you may go far
ther  and  decide to commit some portion of your discretion
ary recreational time specifically to the task of thwarting
this tyrants goal  your rationale may be altruistic  in
the   sense   of  wanting  to  liberate  the  oppressed  or
egoistic in the sense of  proving  you  can  outsmart  the
oppressoror  very likely some combination of these or per
haps even other motives

     but since you have zero desire to become a  martyr  to
your because you are not about to mount a military campaign
or  even try to run a boatload of fish through the blockade
however it is here that technologyand in  particular  in
formation technologycan multiply your efficacy literally a
hundredfold    i say literally because for a fraction of
the effort and virtually none of  the  risk  attendant  to
smuggling in a hundred fish you can quite readily produce a
hundred  xerox copies of fishing instructions  if the tar
geted government like presentday america at least permits
open  discussion  of  topics  whose  implementation  is  re
stricted  then that should suffice  but if the government
attempts to suppress the flow of information as  well  then
you will have to take a little more effort and perhaps write
your  fishing manual on a floppy disk encrypted according to
your mythical eskimos publickey parameters  but as far as
increasing realworld access to fish you have  made  genuine
nonzero  headwaywhich  may  continue to snowball as others
redisseminate the information you have provided   and  you
have not had to waste any of your time trying to convert id
eological  adversaries or even trying to win over the unde
cided  recall harry brownes dictum  from  freedom  in  an
unfree world that the success of any endeavor is in general
inversely proportional to the number of people whose persua
sion is necessary to its fulfilment

     if  you  look  at  history you cannot deny that it has
been dramatically shaped by men with names like  washington
lincoln        nixon      marcos    duvalier   
khadaffi     and their ilk  but it has also been  shaped
by  people with names like edison curie marconi tesla and
wozniak  and this latter shaping has been at least as  per
vasive and not nearly so bloody

     and  that is  where  i am  trying  to  take the libertech
project  rather than beseeching the state to please not en
slave plunder or constrain us i propose a libertarian net
work spreading  the  technologies  by  which  we  may  seize
freedom for ourselves

     but here we must be a bit careful  while it is not at
present  illegal  to  encrypt  information  when government
wants to spy on you there is no guarantee of what  the  fu
ture  may hold  there have been bills introduced for exam
ple which would have made it a crime  to  wear  body  armor
when government wants to shoot you  that is if you were to
commit certain crimes while wearing a kevlar vest then that
fact  would  constitute a separate federal crime of its own
this law to my knowledge has not passed    yet     but
it does indicate how government thinks

     other  technological  applications  however do indeed
pose legal risks  we recognize for  example  that  anyone
who  helped a precivil war slave escape on the underground
railroad was making a clearly illegal use of technologyas
the sovereign government of the united states of america  at
that time found the buying and selling of human beings quite
as  acceptable  as  the buying and selling of cattle  simi
larly during prohibition anyone who used  his  bathtub  to
ferment  yeast and sugar into the illegal psychoactive drug
alcoholthe controlled substance winewas using  technol
ogy  in a way that could get him shot dead by federal agents
for his crimeunfortunately not to be  restored  to  life
when  congress  reversed itself and repermitted use of this
drug

     so    to quote a former president  unindicted  co
conspirator  and pardoned felon    let me make one thing
perfectly clear  the libertech project does not  advocate
participate  in or conspire in the violation of any lawno
matter how oppressive  unconstitutional  or  simply  stupid
such  law may be  it does engage in description for educa
tional and informational  purposes  only  of  technological
processes  and some of these processes like flying a plane
or manufacturing a firearm may well require appropriate li
censing to perform legally    fortunately  no  license  is
needed  for  the  distribution or receipt of information it
self

     so the next time you look at the political  scene  and
despair  thinking  well  if fiftyone of the nation and fiftyone of
this state and fiftyone of this city have  to  turn  libertarian
before  i will  be  free  then  somebody might as well cut my
goddamn throat now and put me out of my  miseryrecognize
that  such  is not the case  there exist ways to make your
self free

     if you wish to explore such techniques via the project
you are welcome to give me your name and addressor a  fake
name  and  mail  drop for that matterand you will go on the
mailing list for my erraticallypublished newsletter    any
friends  or acquaintances whom you think would be interested
are welcome as well  i am not even asking for stamped  self
addressed envelopes since my printer can handle mailing la
bels and actual postage costs are down in the noise compared
with  the  other  efforts  in getting an issue out   if you
should have an idea to share or even a  useful  product  to
plug  i will be glad to have you write it up for publication
even if you want to be the proverbial free rider and  just
benefit  from  what others contributeyou are still welcome
everything will be public domain feel free to  copy  it  or
give it away or sell it for that matter because if you can
get  money  for  it while i am taking fullpage ads trying to
give it away you are certainly entitled to  your  capitalist
profit     anyway every application of these principles
should make the world just a little freer and i am certainly
willing to underwrite that at least for the forseeable  fu
ture

     i  will leave you with one final thought  if you do not
learn how to beat your plowshares into  swords  before  they
outlaw  swords  then you sure as hell ought to learn before
they outlaw plowshares too

 i understand the when one is in orbit the inward force of gravity at

force from the orbiting motion resulting in weightlessness

 i want to know what weightlessness actually feels like for example is
there a constant sensation of falling and what is the motion sickness
that some astronauts occasionally experience

subject re earwax
organization university of vermont  division of emba computer facility
lines twenty

hi stephen
ear wax is a healthy way to help prevent ear infections both by preventing
a barrier and also with some antibiotic properties  too much can block the
external auditory canal the hole in the outside of the ear and because some 
hearing problems  it is very simple and safe to remove excess wax on your
own or at your physicians office  you can take a syringe no needles and
fill it with fifty warm water cold can cause fainting and fifty otc hydrogen
peroxide  then point the ear towards the ceiling  about fortyfive degrees up
and insert the tip of the syringe helps to have someone else do this and  
firmly expell the solution  depending on the size of the syringe and the
tenacity of the wax this could take several rinses  if you place a bowl 
under the ear to catch the water it will be much drier   you can buy
a syringe with a special tip at your local pharmacy or just use whatever
you may have  if wax is old it will be harder and darker  you can try
adding a few drops of olive oil into the ear during a shower to soften up
the wax  do this for a couple days then try syringing again  it is also
safe to point your ear up at the shower head and allow the water to rinse
it out
good luck

in article one thousand nine hundred and ninetythreeaprtwentyonethirtytwo thousand four hundred and twentyseventwentytwo thousand four hundred and sixtyfourlelandstanfordedu punjabilelandstanfordedu sanjeev punjabi writes

as the heading indicates it is impossible for me to fathom why barry is not
batting fourth for the giants behind will clark  barry is such an awesome and
consistent hitter  definitely the best in the national league  imho to 
have williams a streaky hitter and not really a clutch hitter batting
fourth ahead of bonds is simply an injustice to the giants and fans of the
giants

two simple reasons

one   batting williams ahead of bonds will create a leftclark 
      rightwilliams leftbonds situation in the middle of the
      batting order  this makes it tougher for opposing manager
      to change pitchers

two   having bonds batting behind williams means that matt will get
      more good pitches to hit  this is important since he struggles
      so much with breaking balls  opposing pitchers do not want to
      walk williams to get to bonds

mph  on the same three to four lane road  around washington dc they cannot
keep traffic  flowing at fiftyfive

germans are just more organised you cannot blitz all of europe in a
matter of  what nine months unless you are pretty organised if we tried
that there would just be a whole bunch of tanks backed up at the border
waiting for some jerk in the right lane trying to get over to make a
left turn

this of course caused germany to invade belgium one of the important
lessons of history is that anything including late afternoon
thundershowers will cause germany to invade belgium

jblankenccatsasupennedu james r blankenship writes
 

jesus only and oneness tend to refer to groups that do deny the
trinity    
they explain matthew by saying that jesus is the name of the father jesus
is the name of the son and jesus is the name of the name of the holy
spirit father son  holy spirit referring to different roles all
filled by jesus 
 
imho this are going from bad to worse threeinone oneinthree was bad enough
 
i do not like a god who prays to himself  i refuse to believe jesus prayed
to himself     let us get real if the scriptures say he prayed to the
father then the father is someone different than the son  i have no
problems with multiple gods  to me the whole context of the scriptures
says  be perfect even as your father who is in heaven that we can be
coheirs with christ that we will be like him
 
coheirs share all things equallyincluding knowledge power dominion etc
when i am like him christ i will be the same as he isand he is a god
 
if god cannot do this the his is not all powerfuland he is not god
if he will not he is a liarand he is not god
 
but if he does he is the greatest of all the gods
 

i do not know of anyone who says that jesus prayed to himself  the
whole point of the trinity is that there is enough of a distinction
within god that relationship is possible  this implies some sort of
communication  i assume that in their native form the father and
son are directly enough connected that prayer in our sense is not
involved  but jesus is the incarnation of the son ie  the logos
made flesh  when he is in a human form his human actions are limited
to human capabilities  so communication with the father takes the
form of prayer  i do not see that there is anything problematical about
that  it seems to be implicit in the whole idea of incarnation

and no siggraph ninetythree has not skipped town  we are preparing the best
siggraph conference yet

speaking of siggraph i just went through the ordeal of my annual registration
for siggraph and reupping of membership in the acm last night and was i ever
grossed out  the new prices for membership are almost highway robbery

for example

	siggraph basic fee went from twentysix last year to fiftynine this year for the same
	thing a one hundred and twentyseven increase  those facile enough to arrange a trip to the
	annual conference could reduce this to twentyseven by selecting siggraph lite
	which means siggraph is charging an additional thirtytwo or so for the
	proceedings and the art show catalog essentially

	toplas went up forty in cost way outstripping the current inflation rate

	basic sigchi fees remainded the same but whereas before sigchi
	membership included uist and human factors conferences proceedings
	these are now an extra cost option  bundling that back into the basic
	rate equivalent services have gone up one hundred in cost

	sigois membership cost has up thirtythree but they have also split out the
	computer supported cooperative work conference proceedings that used to
	be included with membership  adding that cost back in means this sig
	also has doubled its membership fee

what really galls me is that the acm sent out brochures a couple months ago
touting their new approach to providing member services and tried to make it
sound like they were offering new services  but with the exception of a couple
like siggraph all the plus services appear to be just splitting the costs
into smaller piles so that they do not look so big  but their recommended
changes to my membership would have me paying ninety more than last year for a thirtyone
increase in services measured by cost not by value and curiously a thirtyone
inflation rate on the publications i got last year

is anyone out there as galled by this extortion as i am

discussing the use of irq seven

in  recent article mspraguesuperiormcwbstthree hundred and elevenb mike sprague writes

i as a number of poeple in this thread have already written
i cannot prove it is true but i believe it lptone does not
actually use irqseven even though that interrupt is supposed to
be dedicated to lptone

to put it a little differently

  irq seven is the de facto standard interrupt assigned to be used by the
   printer adapter to announce its completion of some activity

  dos does not monitor irq seven it uses other means to determine when it is
   time to send out another byte to the printer

  most all hardware printer adapters have the ability to disable
   the use of irq seven usually by merely breaking the connection between
   the isa pin and the associated driver  other adapters control the
   irq line by a tristate driver and by programming just leave it
   in the highimpedence mode

  unfortunately there are a lot of adapter cards which use bistate
   drivers ie either assert high or assert low for the irq lines
   rather than tristate drivers assert high assert low or do not
   assert anything  the presence of such a card on an irq line precludes
   the use of that irq by any other adapter unless it is physically 
   disconnected by a jumper

   incidentally note that there is no requirement that a card hold
   the irq line low when no interrupt is desired  if that were true
   you would have to somehow tie down all unconnected irq lines and
   that certainly is not a requirement

  nondos operating systems ostwo nt  various unices or whatever the
   proper plural of unix might be require the use of irq seven for performance
   reasons  

and the sbsixteen alas is one of the cards which uses bistate drivers

as promised here is rafiq zakarias discussion of the nature of
the socalled satanic verses from which rushdies title has been
taken rafiq zakaria muhammad and the quran penguin ninetyone

here follows an introduction to the controversial incident and an
 apologetic explanation purporting to show why it could not actually
 have happened  the historicity of the episode does not matter to what
 follows

i do not know whether i am quoting gregg or zakaria below  anyway back
to current affairs

rushdie has by his own admission drawn
on the version given by the orientalist watt 

among others this incident is not something rushdie or watt or anyone
else dug up from nowhere it is a well known story a myth if you
will known according to umar khan to every muslim school boy and
girl and so presumably to rushdie and to gibreel farishta

and then allowed his
imagination to run wild 

yes this is what writing fiction is all about  rushdie was writing
about a crisis of faith and chose this myth to present it by placing
the actor gibreel in the role of the angel whose name he took
rushdie was not writing a history or theology book and nowhere claims
or implies that this is what actually happened  it is somewhat like
stories woven around the relationship between jesus and the reformed
prostitute mary magdalene another myth  or those referring to the
arthurian mythos or the grail legend or the wandering jew or dozens
of others  if you can stand to read the work of a blasphemer
consider salman rushdies childrens book haroun and the sea of
stories for an idea of the way a storyteller  a specific
storyteller  works with existing story lines

to ridicule muhammads integrity

no  muhammads mahounds integrity is not really impugned in this
part of the story and there is no reason to think this was rushdies
intent gibreel as the archangel produces the verses divine and
satanic though he does not know their provenance  it is not implied
in a straight reading that muhammad influences them

     not my voice i would never know such words i am no classy speaker
    never was never will be but this is not my voice it is a voice
      mahounds eyes open wide he is seeing some kind of vision
    staring at it oh that is right gibreel remembers me  he is
    seeing me  my lips moving being moved by  what whom  do not
    know cannot say  nevertheless here they are coming out of my
    mouth up my throat past my teeth the words
      being gods postman is no fun yaar
      butbutbut god is not in this picture
      god knows whose postman i have been

it is ambiguous is mahound somehow manipulating gibreel  is it satan
or something else  the answer is not given

to be sure the question is raised  this novel explores faith and the
role of revelation in religion among other things  addressing loss
of faith implicitly raises questions about the truth of revelation
but this novel proposes no answers at least not directly  the very
existence of a newsgroup named altatheism raises the same
questions more forcefully and does propose some answers which is
the real relevance  if rushdies mild fictional exploration is filth
and lies and he asked for what he got are we next on the fatwa
list  that is a rhetorical question of course

take a look at the standings it is real easy to get so focussed on

working you do not screw it up by changing things just because you think it

so that is the reason why the toronto blue jays should keep alfredo

a team not winning does not mean that everything that it is doing is wrong or
otherwise to borrow the sharks situation you would say that george kingston

some folks like to argue about theoretical details i prefer to watch teams
win when the giants slip to third then we can talk about how to rearrange
the batting order until then i think it is stupid to focus on what is wrong
for the simple fact that it is working as it is

by then it is too late  the problem with not fixing something while it is
working is that by then there may not be anything left to fix

mostly though the giants are winning and frankly as long as that
continues it is rather silly to secondguess their strategy but evidently

nntppostinghost hernessun

in article  nmzerowandrewcmuedu nanci ann miller writes
emarshhernessunengsuncom eric marsh writes
 by the way the parallel universe approach implys an element of mind in the
 very physical reality of the universe 

this sounds interesting but what exactly do you mean  

well the best thing to do is to read the book parallel universes
by dr fred wolf 

in essence dr wolf says that one interpretation of the subatomic
particlewave duality is that what we perceive as a wave is actually
an infinate number of parallel universes overlaid and in each of
these universes there is a particle in a different location when we
do something to make a particle appear we are actually causing
all the parallel universes to collapse into one apparently this is
one line of thought on the nature of qm that is going through some
of the scientific community

dr wolf and many others claim that somehow the collapse is caused
by the mental effort of observing the particle this implys that
mind is more than merely a biological phenomenon he then extrapolates
that if mind is an integral part of the universe then perhaps consciousness
is the element that gives order and form to the universes itthemselfs

it all gets rather interesting but what i find facinating is that
this would explain the phenomenon of magick as practiced in my
religion dr wolf speculates that the ordering functionality of mind
could be caused by the selection of a future from an infinite number of
possible futures he says that this might be done by some sort of
communication between ones current and possible future selves 
i have long speculated that if magick is not merely a form of self
delusion then perhaps it could be caused by some sort of a selection
of one of many possible futures

i realize that this gets pretty bizarre but it never hurts to keep 
an open mind and at least file it all away as another possibile 
explaination of the world in which we find ourselves after all the
more we learn about the universe in which we live the more we learn
that it is truly a very strange place

evolution as i have said before is theory and fact  it is exactly
the same amount of each as the existence of atoms and the existence of
gravity  if you accept the existence of atoms and gravity as fact
then you should also accept the existence of evolution as fact

 
andy

i do not accept atoms or gravity as fact either  they are extremely useful
mathematical models to describe physical observations we can make
other posters have aptly explained the atomic model  gravity too is
very much a theory no gravity waves have even been detected but we
have a very useful model that describes much of the behavior on
objects by this thing we call gravity  gravity however is not 
a fact  it is a theoretical model used to talk about how objects 
behave in our physical environment  newton thought gravity was a
simple vector force einstein a wave both are very useful models that 
have no religious overtones or requirements of faith unless of course you 
want to demand that it is a factual physical entity described exactly 
the way the theory now formulated talks about it  that takes a great 
leap of faith which of course is what religion takes  evolution
is no different

 
 jim halat         halatbearcom     

are you serious  here is an exercise next time you are in the barnyard 
take your model and hold it directly above a fresh cowpie  then release the
model  you will observe that on its own your model will assume a trajectory
earthward and come to rest exactly where it belongs  watch out for splatters
particularly if you are wearing shorts when you perform this experiment

   as written the second ammendment states rather clearly for anyone who can
   read the following

   a well regulated militia being necessarry to the security of a free state
   the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed

  what is regulated regulated means controlled how about security

stephen a creps writes to all



 sac also we know that
 sac the bible says that everyone must be baptized to enter heaven

where exactly does it say that

 sac everyone includes infants unless there is other scripture to the
 sac contrary ie an exception  since there is no exception listed in the
 sac bible we must assume to be on the safe side that the bible means what
 sac it says that everyone must be baptized to enter heaven

i think we do see an exception in the case of cornelius and his
household mentioned in acts of course they were baptised but only
after god showed that he accepted them by giving them the holy
spirit this means they were already acceptable to god before their
baptism and had they suddenly died they would have gone to heaven

in case that seems farfetched  an ancestor of mine was a missionary
who worked among the hereros in namibia some of the tribesmen were
jealous of christianity and they poisoned the first convert before he
could be baptised surely he still went to heaven i am inclined to
agree with a comment recorded at the time it is not the neglect of
baptism but its contempt that condemns

can anyone offer a suggestion on a problem i am having
i have several boards whose sole purpose is to decode dtmf tones and send
the resultant in ascii to a pc  these boards run on the serial interface
i need to run  of the boards somwehat simultaneously  i need to be able to ho
ok them up to a pc  the problem is how do i hook up eight serial devices to one
pc inexpensivley so that all can send data simulataneously or close to it
any help would be greatly appreciated


are the boards at all intelligent  ie run by microcontrollers  the
easiest thing would be to have another line that says that one of the
boards is talking to the pc  when this line was true the other boards
could all hold off and not send their data  this is not a perfect solution
though since you have to worry a little about making sure two boards do not
decide to talk at the exact same time

other than that i think you will need to hook up each board to something
that speaks rstwo hundred and thirtytwo  this actually is not as hard or as expensive as it
used to be though  assuming the boards talk relatively slowly nine thousand six hundred bps
or slower the pics can coordinate things between themselves to multiplex
the data  this is really just forbicly adding the suggestion in the first
paragraph to your system  and it assumes that each board does not talk more
than oneeightth of the time of for very long since a pic is not going to be
able to buffer more than maybe twentysome bytes

you might want to check into the prices of multiserial card for your pc

one thing to recall  putting a satellite as high as possible is one thing 
coming back to not only that altitude but matching the position of it in 
its orbit on a subsequent mission is another thing  any misalignment of the 
plane of the orbit during launch or being ahead or behind the target will 
require more fuel to adjust  this was considered in the original deployment 

i agree though that the demands on the crew and complexity are stupendous

presented without any evidence to support it  if you are able to present
real evidence for it then great  but unsupported claims or even claims
by such and such news agency will not be accepted  if you want to
stick to the sheer impossible instead of the merely difficult then
fine  

the statement that if such a fact is classified then you 
cannot prove it is a simple matter of pragmatics and the law  if you 
have access to classified information that you know to be classified
and you reveal it there is a good chance that you or someone else 
the person who revealed it to you is going to jail

if you are considering buying a system with a view to using
it to run unix linux bsd etc or some other special software
there is a good chance that it will not work with the diamond cards

that is if the special software is free like xfreeeightysix  there are
vendors that sells diamond x drivers for commercial unices  but
then they charge 

this is due to diamonds propriety attitude to it is hardware
it is impossible to get free information from them about their chips 
specifically their dotclocks without paying and signing nondisclosure
agreements

i think they only need a signing ie no paying  this still
violates the fsfs policy of publically available code

this made it impossible for the free software foundation to provide
xwindows compatibility with these cards as diamond did not want to 
divulge programming neccessities

while this is true there are fixes for those who have already
bought diamond cards  in linux for example there are utilities
that will put the card in vesa mode before invoking x  of course
this means no fine tuning of diamond cards but at least this
will allow those who are stuck with them to use linuxx

i agree with marks suggestion  if you are buying a video card
for specialized free software avoid diamond  but if you already
have one there may be a fix that can help you

                    this weeks thoughts 

last week the supreme court refused without comment to hear an
appeal by rensselaer in school officials desiring the
distribution of bibles in their public schools relsixtyfive fivetwentyone a
lower court had banned the local gideons an international bible
distribution group from passing out bibles to fifthgraders the
aclus barry lynn was quoted as saying that the courts action
protected the religious neutrality of our public schools he also
said that schools must serve students of all faiths and none
schools were not to be a bazaar where rival religious groups
compete for converts according to lynn

several gideons men who are responsible for putting bibles in
hospitals and hotels are members of our church they tell of
similar stories where they are only allowed to distribute bibles on
sidewalks around the schools but cannot go inside the schools
they tell of mild harassment by parents who do not want their
children receiving a bible from a stranger they are willing to
continue their work at a distance but find the schools position
somewhat disheartening

i understand rationally and logically the courts position and i
can see the sense of fairness for all groups but on the other
hand when does neutrality become nihilism when does plurality
turn into no position at all

i see a couple of ironies here one is that we can pass out condoms
but not bibles in our schools think on that one for a moment

the other is that while we are seeking religious neutrality in
our schools countries like russiawho by the way practiced
religious neutrality for the past seventy yearsare making the 
bible part of their public school curriculum when i was in st
petersburg in march the church we worked with had trained over one hundred
public school teachers to teach the bible and the government had
requested hundreds more i recently heard a medical doctor who is
president of the gideon chapter in moscow tell how they are eagerly
invited to the university of moscow to distribute bibles to the
students and are given class time to explain its contents i
remember seeing a photograph of this doctor holding a bible and
speaking to the university students standing under a statue of
lenin now that is ironic

i admit two things one we are a pluralistic society and all faiths
have equal footing this is what our country was founded on two to
allow every group on school grounds could create a bazaarlike
atmosphere each city must work to be inclusive of all religions
and provide a hearing for them threei know i said twothe vitality
of religious faith is not dependent upon whether or not the public
arena acknowledges it as valid

howeverand you knew this was comingi believe disallowing the
distribution of the bible by lawabiding caring adults in our
schools only signals once again our cultures movement away from a
singular base from which we as individuals and as a nation can make
moral and ethical decisions

i would not think so  asking people to trust a secret algorithm seems
unsound to me

maybe so but it is quite common

not when your talking about cryptography

there are millions of macintosh users who
have no idea what is in apples patented roms many have modems connected
how do you know all your business secrets are not being stolen answer
one because you trust apple

think again  you will not see me using apples new signature from the
finder feature

two because if any such attempt however sophicsticated came out it would
destroy apples credibility forever

this analogy fails in its assumption that the government gives two
squirts about credibility


in addition apples proclaimed purpose in releasing the macintosh was not
survellience

quite the opposite
on january twentyfour apple will introduce macintosh and you will see why
one thousand nine hundred and eightyfour will not be like one thousand nine hundred and eightyfour

so do not give me any bullshit analogies about how we trust coke not to
put mind control drugs in every can to get us to buy more


in the clipper case a representative body of experts is going to be allowed
to audit it and we will have assurances maybe even from the president that
other than the escrowed keys there are no back doors while some may not
have confidence in that i am not among them it is a lot more assurance
than we get for many things we routinely trust in everyday life

 default you refer to prison is not a normal situation

is this an arguement against or for  or simply a statement of agreeance

does not the bible say that god is a fair god sic  if this is true
how can this possibly be fair to the infants

andrew byler writes

what do you mean fair  god is just giving to everyone what they
deserve as all infants are in sin from the time of conception cf
romans fivetwelve psalm oneseven they cannot possibly merit heaven and as
purgatory is for the purging of temporal punishment and venial sins it
is impossible that origianl sin can be forgiven

why is it fair to punish you me and the rest of humanity because of
what adam and eve did suppose your parents committed some crime before
you were born and one day the cops come to your door and throw you in
jail for it would you really think that is fair i know i would not

well suppose your mother was a crack addict and crack userabuser while
she was pregnant suppose your husband gave you some sdt this recently
happened to a close friend of my wife and mine

often the consequences of our sin are at least partially inflicted on
innocent people several times in the ot this is pointed out even
saying that descendants would suffer consequences for a persons sin
for several generations even today we see multigenerational to
coin a phrase effects from alcoholism child abuse and spousal
abuse just to name three

so gods definition of fair and ours differ

some points of perspective

though the predisposition towards sinning is now inbred see websters
first definition of inbred thanks to adam it is arrogant and foolish
for any of us to think we would have done any different if we were in
their shoes i know myself pretty well and i am just not that good take
gods word for it neither are you there is no one righteous

more important when a person decides to be a disciple of jesus god
promises supernatural help in overcoming our physical selfs sinful
tendency we can of course choose to ignore this help rom seveneight

  one so what
 
 homosexuals lie about the ten number to hide the disproportionate
 involvement of homosexuals in child molestation  they also lie
 about ten to keep politicians scared
 

back your statments with proof or shut up

  two it will be interesting to see the reaction when twofivemillion queers
     gather in washington dc after all if there are only sixmillion of
     us then this is an event unprecidented in history
 
 but many of the people who will be marching are not homosexuals but
 other members of the leftist agenda
 

again back your statements or shut up

  the article also contains numbers on the number of sexual partners
  the median number of sexual partners for all men twentythirtynine was seventhree
  
  do not forget that twentyfive had twenty or more partners
 
 not surprising  remember that study includes homosexuals as well
 

hmm  tell me did you go to the mickey mouse school of logic  you have
just stated that there are not many homosexuals as kinsey reported in his
survey and the surveys of the kinsey institute since  then you say that
the reason many young people are promiscuous is because homosexuals form
a large part of that group or there are some homosexuals whose lives 
consist of having sex with no gaps for eating c  using your logic
it would seem to suggest that on average gay men have about two thousand partners each
a week  try to think through your arguments carefully  or then again not
because i like to laugh every now and then

  compared to the table i have already posted from masters johnson
  and kolodny showing male homosexual partners it is apparent that
  homosexual men are dramatically more promiscuous than the general
  male population  
  
  and what did this study show for number of sexual contacts for those
  who said they where homosexual or is that number to inconvient for
  you
 
 it was not published
 

hence the argument cannot be resolved using this data  next point please

  it is a shame that we do not have a breakdown for
  straight men vs gaybi men  that would show even more dramatically
  how much more promiscuous gaybi men are
  
  fuck off
 
 typical homoseuxal response
 
 

this depends on the premise that there are only three types of behaviour gay bi
and hetero  this has yet to be proved  see an earlier post about the kinsey
institute of grading  this although rough seems more logical  also you use
this would show defining a fact and not an assumption  again back your 
statements or shut up

it is interesting sometimes to listen to yous news as seen through
the eyes of another country

bbc world news service on shortwave originating out of london
reports that a survivor of the waco massacre states that a tank when
making a hole in the wall of the building knocked over a kerosene
lamp and that is how the fire started  attempts were made by the
people inside to put out the fire but it spread too quickly

has anyone in yous heard anything similar or are yous government

the bbc news is also reporting that about twenty of those that died

 hi there
 
 i am german and i have been into this mlb stuff since almost one year now
 there are many problems occuring for me one of them is the era statistic for
 pitchers what does it say 

era indicates the average number of earned runs attributed to a pitcher per
nine inning game  thus if a pitcher pitched three innings and gave up one earned
run his nine inning equivelent perfomance would be three earned runs thus his era
is threezero  to compute the era you simply take the number of earned runs divided
by the innings pitched and then multiple the result by nine

	era  erip  nine

i think there is another formula for era  i heard something about it last 
year  i am not sure what it is but i am going to give it a stab  it allows for
a pitcher to pitch more than nine innings at a time and not benefit cuz it
uses outs recorded instead of innings pitched

        era  ertwentysevenouts recorded

like i said i am not sure this is exactly it but i am pretty sure they changed
it to something of the sort


an earned run is run that is given up by the pitcher that is not attributed
to a fielding error  more specifically if an error occurs that represented
the third out all runs scored after the error are considered unearned runs
earned runs are also runs scored as a result of players who were left on base
when the pitcher exited the game  here are some examples

	if there are two outs in an inning and there are men on base  if
	an error occurs that represents the third out all of the runs after
	this error and not counted as earned runs

	if a pitcher issues some base on balls walks and leaves the game
	before the inning is completed he is responsible for the people who
	were left on base  if the those runners who were left on base score
	and the score was not a result of an error those eraned runs are
	attributed to the pitcher who left the game

i hope this explains things for you

   the serial number will be in a sixtyfour bit block with a thirtyfour bit filler  does not
   take a lot to check to see if that is correct

depends on whether the filler is a constant makes checking easy
but susceptible to replay or variable eg timer counter random
which makes replay harder and can also make it easier for the
inquisitors to know if they have missed messages or gotten them out of
sequence or other interesting things that sort of person might care about

i would use a secret nope obscure cryptographic encoding to expand the 
thirty bit serial number to a sixtyfour bit block the redundancy hereby introduced 
can be used to detect tampered clipper signals where some public enemy 
replaced the le block by random data 

and of course the le block would be used to initialise the encryption 
of the user data so that at the receiving end the correct le block must 
be processed in order to have any chance of getting the plaintext back 

for those of you who might want to mangle the le block eg by xoring 
a constant pattern on the transmission line and restore it before feeding 
it into the receiving crippler chip i would add further encrypted copies 
of this block perhaps created by repeated application of the encryption 
algorithm or so at regular intervals during the transmission if the 
receiving chip detects a mismatch it must assume that the line is bad and 
it will cease to work in your own interest you are protected from getting 
faulty plaintext you know  it is just like a checksum for your own 
safety  

the monitoring agencies will not have the famous black box which is needed 
for actual decryption and will be kept by the fbi but nothing prevents 
them from using special boxes which will do the redundancy check for the 
serial number block and consistency checks on the embedded le blocks 
within the transmission these boxes will turn a red light on as soon as 
they detect a bitstream that violates the correct protocol

so do not anyone think that you can use the chip and fool le about the 
tapping key  i bet the developpers have provided much better checks 
than those suggested above of course it is absolutely crucial that the 
algorithms and protocols remain secret personally i doubt they will

 i have been getting mail from xhibition about the june conference and i was
 wondering if microsoft had bought xhibition  the front says conference
 from microsoft windows nt developers  what is the deal  i thought
 xhibition was for xwindows
 
  
       jesse w asher                                          

yes xhibition is for the x window system  the x window system conference 
remains the largest and most complete conference devoted to x  nineteen full
and half day tutorials and thirtysix technical sessions over three days
provide huge amounts of information for x application developers  add vendor
exhibits and a product presentation track to provide information on what
folks can purchase today and you have a complete show focused on xeleven

speakers at xhibition ninetythree include 

  bob schiefler lu abel mark ackerman paul asente doug blewett 
  donna converse jim fulton oliver jones keith packard ralph swick 
  doug young and many others

xhibition is growing fortunately for us and we have added some additional
conferences  surveys that we have given have indicated additional topics of
interest  these include object oriented technologies such as the object
management groups orb and corba c as it applies to x client server
technologies such as dce threads databases object oriented and relational
and not surprisingly when you look at the audience windows nt

with the bulk of the xhibition audience and the unix community developing
applications for inhouse or custom use a new thirtytwobit operating system from a
player as large as microsoft needs to be evaluated with ms windows on so many
desktops and the price of computing power dropping its successor needs to be
evaluated  as corporations begin to look at nt so must their developers and
suppliers

the mission of the xhibition technical conferences is to provide information
to the application developer and to the technology planner  the nt conference
at xhibition is designed to do just that  we worked with microsoft to provide
the only conference this year specifically designed to show x and unix
developers the capabilities of windows and nt  if you are not sure that nt has
what you need for your application development or systems deployment this is
the place to find out  ask the folks from microsoft get them to show you
what you need  conference attendees will receive nt software development
kits to bang on evaluate and generally to see for yourself

i hope this does not sound like an nt commercial it should sound like an
xhibition commercial  i just want to reiterate that the xhibition audience
is growing and xhibition is growing along with it  the industry is a
confusing place at the moment with unix cose nt dce corba and all of
the other acronyms sprouting up  xhibition can help sort out the confusion

i need information on the medical including emotional  pros and
cons of circumcision at birth  i am especially interested in
references to studies that indicate disadvantages or refute studies
that indicate advantages  a friend who is a medical student is
writing a survey paper and apparently the studies she has run into
are all for circumcision the main argument being a lower risk of
penile cancer

please email responses as i am not a frequent reader of either group
i will summarize to the net

i am very surprised that medical schools still push routine circumcision
of newborn males on the population since your friend is not a man she


money probably has a lot to do with keeping the practice of routine 
circumcision alive it is another opporitunity to charge a few hundred
extra bucks for a completely unnecessary procedure the rationale for 
which until recently has been accepted without question by most
parents of newborns  

one could also imagine that complications arising from circumcision
infections sloppy jobs etc are far more common than the remote chance
of penile cancer it is purported to prevent  
 

cannot imagine what it is like to have a penis much less a foreskin i
guess if american medicine did an artistic job of circumcising every
male then the visual result would be somewhat more natural in
appearance

the penile cancer thing has been completely debunkedshe must be
going to school on a south pacific island tell her to check the journal
or urology for circumcision articles i remember at least one on an old
jewish man cut at birth who developed penile canceri mean if the
cancer risk was that great the europe who have been circumcising like
crazy too teaching a boy how to keep his cockhead clean is the issue a
little proper hygiene goes a long way  americans are just too hung up on
the penis to consider cleaning it that is just way too much like
mastubation so you have surgical intervention that is basically
unnecessary

if anybody has a strong claim to control of the  the night sky it is 
astronomers  check out the common law  in the days when wild lands
were not scarce pioneers laid claim to the land by putting it to
use eg clearing and growing a crop  even trespassers can lay claim to 
the right of passage if if they have done it for long enough and the
owners have not complained or taken steps to stop them  usage
begets property rights

astronomers have been using the night sky for thousands of years 
they own it 
eg light polluters they will lose their commonlaw right of ownership

another consequence of their ownership is that they are free to sell
it  now astronomers need money for their work  if light
polluting billboards and mirrors go up they will need even
more money to buy extra image processing equipment filters
space telescopes etc to get around the problem

so as long as we can define who astronomers are eg do
they include amateur astronomers  nature lovers
we can set up a system of voluntary consensus to solve this
dispute instead invoking bans regulations etc enforced
by bribed politicians at the point of a gun why do folks always
think of that sordid solution we ought to pass a law to
solve problems first instead of as a last resort when other
methods have failed

stuff deleted
  this proposal certainly needs work but how about working on 
these kind of ideas first before writing there ought to be a law 
letters to our congresscritters let us give noncoercive consensus via 
the free market a chance to solve this problem

jim hart
jhartagoraraincom

would mr hart please explain how one could get every nation on
earth and every corporation to agree that astronomers own the
night sky without coercion   remember that not every nation
follows the english common law   in most countries for most of
history it was probably true that the rulers owned everything
not explicitly owned by individuals   even in north america
where by the principle enunciated the aboriginal inhabitants should
have owned everything when new arrivals wanted to use land
and resources they just took it over  in case mr hart has not noticed
there is currently a brutal war going on in bosnia about who owns what
of course if some friendly super power were to give an international
astronomy organization some antisatelite missiles and also agree
to defend it if attacked such a proposal might work but it
would hardly be noncoercive

some of us nutty environmentalists think it might make sense first
to try to mobilize public opinion against advertising in space
and also to use governmental actions like taxing power for example
to discourage them   this of course would be too coercive for

dougbcommmotcom doug bank writes

my wifes obgyn has an ultrasound machine in her office  when

on her next visit my wife asked another doctor in the office if
they read the ultrasounds themselves or if they had a radiologist
read the pictures  the doctor very vehemently insisted that they
were qualified to read the ultrasound and radiologists were not

my wife is concerned about this  she saw a tv show a couple months
back something like twentytwenty or dateline nbc etc where an expert
on fetal ultrasounds a radiologist was showing all the different
deffects that could be detected using the ultrasound

should my wife be concerned  should we take the pictures to a 
radiologist for a second opinion and if so where would we find
such an expert in chicago  we do not really have any special medical
reason to be concerned but if a radiologist will be able to see
things the obgyn cannot then i do not see why we should not use one

any thoughts

 as far as i can see if your obstetrition has an ultrasound in his rooms
and is expirienced its use and interpretation he should be just as
capable of reading it as any radiologist all doctors are qualified to
read xrays yous ct scans etc it is just that a radiologist does nothing
else and thus is only better at reading them because of all this time
spent doing this skill in reading xrays etc just comes from plenty of
practice if your obstetrition reads heaps of obstetric ultrasounds he
should be able to pick up any abnormalities that can be demonstrated by

 	anyway  i am looking for advice for the use of
 antihistamines as sleep aids  and if there are any dangers of such use
 seems safe to me since they are used chronically for allergies by
 millions  i do not want to try bzs  because bz addiction seems to be
 a serious threat  and from what i hear  bz sleep quality is not good
 whereas antihistamine sleep quality seems to be better for me  i have
 tried some dietary tryptophan loading stuff  and that also seems to
 lower sleep quality  i seem to wake up around fourzero or so and be in some
 kind of mental haze until sevenzero or eightzero  also  i would be interested in
 any other advice for helping my problem  although i have already tried
 many of the nonpharmacological solutions

antihistamines have been the active ingredient of otc sleep aids for
decades  go to any drugstore and look at the packages of such sleep
aids as sominex nytol etc  the active ingredient is
diphenhydramine the same antihistamine that is in benadryl

let me give you another story that actually happened to me  we sell
communications boards that use a sixtyeight thousand  they used to be high tech our
agent in the uk sold a system to a company in ch which packaged it in a
product for cz londonbernprague  i telexed the brits and told them
the swiss need to pass export paperwork through the us as at the time
you needed an export lisence for these systems

now i knew the nsa was watching this traffic just like they are watching
this traffic

and what do you know two weeks later an agent of the us government shows
up in my office to remind me if we or our agents sold systems into the evil
empire we had better make sure the export lisences were handled properly

he was part of a five man office in columbus ohio who did this stuff
based on sources he could not reveal i assume most of the time these
guys sat around the office with their thumbs up their ass as there is not
that much stuff coming out of columbus 

wow the electric utility in prague sure is a big worry for these folks 

the point is we have created a giant bureaucracy nsa with a budget
bigger than the cias who like all bureaucracies fill their time looking
for things to do  the evil empire is gone  the nsa is not  they will do
something to fill their time and justify their budgets  i just wish they
too would sit around with their thumbs up their ass but that is too
much to hope for they will spy on us and do things like skipjack and
subvert people like dorothy denning  sigh

austin c archer archausaturnwwcedu wrote

i am interested in views about the nonevent of may three seriously how can a 
christian discriminate between messages from god which are to be taken 
seriously and those which are spurious  is there a useful heuristic which 
would help us avoid embracing messages which by their nonfulfillment are 
proven to be false thus causing the name of christ to be placed in 
disrepute is this a problem at all

it is possible that the individual saw a true prophetic vision but that he
interpreted the scale of time and space according to his material con
sciousness translating the supersensible perceptions of a plane above
that of time and space into an immediate worldly context  and getting it
wrong  not that he did it rationally but rather that unconsciously the
perceptions became clothed in material images instead of remaining in the
realm of the potential and notyettimespacebound  this difficulty of
translating prophetic vision into a concrete when and where has always been
difficult even for the prophets of old  that is why their prophecies are
so often subject to multiple interpretations  likewise the apostles seemed
to feel that the return of the lord was to be very soon in the sense of
perhaps the same generation yet the meaning of very soon has proven to
be different than they could grasp  prophetic vision tends to telescope
time so that things that are far off appear to be very close

another possibility is that the vision was one of a real event preparing to
happen again in the realm of the potentialbutnotyetmanifest and which
was thwarted by other forces including possibly an act of divine mercy

there are many concrete prophecies being made these days by devout and
sincere and sober christians and others too  it seems that great coming 
events are really casting their shadow before their arrival in these 
apocalyptic times  the various predictions i am talking about those that
appear to be sincere and sober are hard to accept yet hard to ignore com
pletely  one has the feeling something is about to start to get ready to 
begin to commence to happen  we are living as the chinese saying goes
in interesting times

as for how to discriminate the bible does not help much  there is an old
testament passage i forget where it is that says you will know whether
a prophet is true by whether or not his prophecy comes to pass  that
helps eliminate the failures after the fact but in the case of an earth
quake it is small comfort  it seems to me that all prophecies that give
specific times and places and events should be suspect not in that they
are necessarily false but in the sense stated above that all such visions
are subject to mistranslation from the plane of prophetic vision to the
plane of earthly time and space

for what it is worth rudolf steiner once was asked whether a modern initiate 
could see into the future and predict coming events  his answer was that 
it would be possible but then he would have to withdraw from active parti
cipation in them including proclaiming what he saw  if this is in fact
a spiritual law then the answer to your question about how to discriminate
is that the one who makes such prophecies is probably violating that law
knowingly or unknowingly and as such his message should be considered
a priori to be dubious  ie i would expect that those capable of making
true predictions and giving accurate expression to them would not do so in 
the way that the prophet of the oregon earthquake did  however i can
sympathize with the person who published the prophecy given the same
overwhelming experience that he apparently had  i too might feel impelled 
and even commissioned by god to tell my fellow human beings about what 
i had seen

from natarajartsgmotcom kumaravel natarajan

but they can put out a lot of particulate matter  i heard
something about legislation being discussed to clean up
diesel emissions  is there anything in the works to
install scrubbers for diesels  how about the feasibility
of installing them on trucks and cars  would it be any
different than a catylitic converter  i would assume easier
since we are removing particulate matter instead of converting
gasses  let us hear peoples opinions

the technology cummins is applying to diesels to comply with
the newer ca emissions laws involves three things i know of

one all compliant diesels are turbocharged
two all use an aftercooler which cools the air which was heated
   by compression by the turbocharger up to about twentyfive psi
three a gismo on the injector pump which senses the pressurized air
   intake and limits full delivery of fuel while the pressure is
   low

no scrubbers catalytic converters etc are used  the path from
the turbocharger to the exhaust outlet is kept very free

interestingly except for the lowpressure fuel limitation power output 
and mileage are enhanced by these measures  one can buy aftermarket
turbos and aftercoolers which generate more power lots more power
and these are approved by the carb

 other hardware includes modemfax serial ports and a teletext board

applications used include normal windows stuff excel word quicken

work environment which includes turtle beach wave for windows mcs stereo
and other misc stuff for dinking around with audio files  also i use
stacker on the primary drive hp newwave for my wifes use and she 
will not let me get rid of it and a product called infinite disk from 
chili pepper software for hierarchical storage management of my seldom 
used offline files  

i plan to upgrade to nt when it becomes a released product  i was stongly
tempted to become a beta user early on but i do not have time to mess around
with the hassles of beta software  i expect to buy it tear off the 
shrink wrap and use it without hassle i know unrealistic but i can
hope cannot i after all i have work to do

the advice i want concerns the state of nt regarding device drivers and 
hardware specific stuff in general  how smoothly can i expect the 
upgrade to go  can i expect support for all my stuff or do i
still need to scramble around downloading drivers pas orchid colorado 
from some bbs etc  what steps should i take to ensure the installation
goes smoothly  note that i want to nuke dos totally from the system  i am
allergic to command lines  i plan to run a pure nt system  also will 
nt communicate with the workgroups lan  what about stacker  i currently 
have stacker on the first disk drive  without stacker and the infinite 
disk product i will have great difficulty fitting everything i have on the 
system it is cramped now

i realize stacker will be incompatible with nt but will there be an nt 
version  or will nt support compression a la dos six  i know infinite disk
will be incompatible with nt but will they offer or does anybody else
a comparable product for nt and at what cost  perhaps i need to ask 
chili pepper that question  i can live without id if i have to but i would
rather not  will nt run my dos apps the teletext board mainly without
dos on the system  what do i need to keep around

any feedback or advice including forget nt with good reasons is much
appreciated  my only significant reason for moving to nt is i need a better
multitasking environment than windows among other reasons wave locks up
the machine for hours and hours doing dsp processing on large audio files
and i want better lan support than i now have internet access etc  maybe
there are better solutions than nt and if so i would appreciate hearing 
about them ostwo  what is it is status these days

pls respond by email and if there is interest i will summarize for the net

however it did not help the problem  i have also identified that when the machine boots and the drive seeks for a boot disk the head movement during this process is now approximately half the length of the original time  what i mean is the period when the drive light comes on and the heads move from their retracted position out to the track containing the boot sector

pardon me your ignorance cramps my conversation although the administrative 
mechanism was a strictly centralized one the ottoman empire was a classical 
example of a pluralist social order the millet system was the mechanism 
which shaped the social order of the multinational ottoman empire and stood 
behind its continuity as a matter of fact because islamic principles 
were in force in the ottoman empire it was natural to use religious 
criteria to differentiate among the various communities which constituted 
the empire the millet system began to be based on ethnicity in the 
nineteenth century under the influence of nationalism sousa writes of the 
existence of thirteen communities in the ottoman empire in addition to 
the muslim millet in one thousand nine hundred and fourteen these were one greeks attached to the 
orthodox patriarchate in istanbul two catholics or latins who were 
remnants of genoese and venetian merchants three gregorian armenians

 something about legislation being discussed to clean up
 diesel emissions  is there anything in the works to
 install scrubbers for diesels  how about the feasibility
 of installing them on trucks and cars  would it be any
 different than a catylitic converter  i would assume easier
 since we are removing particulate matter instead of converting
 gasses  let us hear peoples opinions
 
 
vw and mercedes have tinkered with particulate traps  also vw
uses a kind of turbocharger on their jetta ecodiesel that helps
reduce particulates as well although i do not know the
mechanics of it
 
many diesel carsbusses and trucks in europe are now being
equipped with catalysts and traps in an effort to clean up
diesel emissions already well below legal limits anyway
 
it is a shame gm had to soil the diesels reputation in
passenger cars and prevent further resource devotion to
research into making this outstandingly efficient engine even
further ahead of gas engines in emissions
 
erik

   i sure do not know what and how they measure in regards to diesel 
 motors in cars trucks and busses but i think they are probably
 measuring the wrong pollutants or at the wrong time or both

   i certainly find it offensive to drive behind a diesel bus or
 diesel truck and some diesel cars  they stink  and it is always
 rollupthewindows panic time when one comes by or ducks in front
 of me when i am driving with my family

   i do not think the combustion mixture is kept under very good
 control in diesel engines and that is why they stink  so the 
 invisible unsmellable pollutants are reduced in diesels  yeah
 well so what  someone forgot about the visible stinky kind and
 as far as i am concerned those kind are just as bad

on the subject of the upcoming new mustang

i do not put much stock in the mag rags inside information or even
ford rep quotes  the taurus was pretty much a surprise when it was
finally disclosed in it is entirety  inside information had the
taurus with a veight and rearwheel drive at one point  i would not look
for a simple repaneled mustang folks you may be cheating yourself
if you do  there is a lot of potential  ford has not released a new
car without a fourwheel is in seven years  the mustang project has been
brewing for at least four right  a fourwheel is could happen  those
modular veights are out there too  in the interest of cafe and
competition do not rule those out either   your ignorant if you do
and there are so many spy shots and artist renderings out there
who really knows what it will look like  the mach iii  doubt it
highly

the next mustang will be fords highest profile car  it attracts
way more attention than the camarofirebird because it is heritage
is more embedded in the general public  do not lie to yourself and
believe ford will forfeit that


the car magazines have printed a lot of information about the new mustang
and the consensus about what to believe in my car circle is that the 
suspension pieces and tuning will be almost identical to the current
cobra but on a stiffer body structure which will improve its behavior
after the mntwelve thunderbird cost and weight debacle ford decided 
independent rear suspension with rear wheel drive will not be tried again in 
a volume car  

the current fourninel veight will soldier on for about two years  a version of
the thirtytwo valve modular veight in the mark viii could be offered then  ford
is spending big money tooling up for twofivel and threefivel vsix engines which will
power most of their cars in the immediate future and therefore probably
do not consider volume production of three hundred hp veight engines a priority 

undisguised the car looks ok but not nearly as exciting as the new
camarofirebird i am going to  

i suspect ford will produce their car with higher quality than gm will 
achieve with the camaro firebird  the way gm loses money the temptation
to just get them out the door for the sake of positive cash flow will be 
great once demand really takes off

summary results of iisi clock modification poll
keywords iisiclockpoll

this poll was conducted to help users decide whether or not to alter their
iisi clock oscillator i have attempted to gather as many case histories as
possible to find some estimate of success and risk the number of replies
probably shows how rare this modification is but give the impression that
success rates may be higher than the previous eighty estimate twentyfour of twentyfour
machines were able to run at twentyfive mhz when no add on boards were present
this is not a scientific survey but it is the best we have to work with

thanks to all who contributed to this poll 


issues

	speed twentyfive mhz to twentysevenfive mhz appears to be the norm for machines without
		add on cards all reported machines were able to use
		twentyfive mhz as long as no add on cards were present several apple
		nubus cards were in use no machine with the nubus adapter
		was able to go faster than twentyfive mhz one was not even able to
		achieve twentyfive mhz with the nubus adapter in place
	
		at speeds of thirtytwo and thirtythree mhz the startup sound is distorted and
		hi density floppy disk problems have been reported
		
		note unless specifically listed below machines were not
			tested with a higher speed clock to failure hence
			the twentyfive mhz operational machines may well work at
			higher speeds
			
	damage one user reported pulling out the plating of one pad this was
		repaired and the machine is operational one other
		reported pulling the pin out of the original clock oscillator
		during desoldering there is one second hand report of a user
		putting a gash in the motherboard with a slipped soldering iron
		
		no reports of static discharge damage
		
		no reports of high speed operation causing damage
		
		then again i also do not have any reports from users of
		defective parachutes
		
	add on boards compatibility appears to be a problem with apple nubus
		adapters several other add on boards have been used with
		success see case histories
		
	heat sinks virtually all modified machines had a heat sink installed
		these were often the totwo hundred and twenty style power transistor type some
		used epoxy some used a dab of heat sink compound with a dab
		of cyanoacrylate glue there was also use of a clamp with a
		bolt through the hole in the motherboard
		
		
		
case histories	

all speeds are the effective cpu speed onetwo of clock oscillator all reported

 i have a four hundred and eightysixsxtwentyfive computer with a one hundred and five mg seagate ide drive and a controler  
 built into the motherboard i want to add a scsi drive a quantum prodrive  
 four hundred and twentyfivef four hundred and twentyfive mg formatted i have no documentation at all and i need your  
 help
 
 as i understand it here is the process of adding such a drive  could you  
 please tell me if i am right
 
 one buy a scsi contoler  which one i know adaptec is good but they are  
 kind of expensive  are there any good boards in the one hundred region i want  
 it to be compatible with ostwo and unix if possible  also i have seen on  
 the net that there are scsi and scsitwo drives is this true does the  
 adapter need to be the same as the drive what type of drive is the  
 quantum


i have tried others but i think that the adaptec is best value for money


 two connect the drive to the adapter via a scsi cable and the power cable
 do i have to worry about the power supply i think i have two hundred watts and  
 all i am powering are two floppies and the seagate drive


i do not think you can mix the two types of drive unless you have one of the
scsiide cards that is available  you will have to turn your ide off


 three setup the bios to recognize the drive as the second drive  what type  
 of drive is this i do not have the numbers for this drive


instructions for drive type are included with the controller  with some it may be
a type one no matter what the disk is  with others it may be a type fortyseven  i had one
controller that i had to tell the bios that no hard disk was installed

 
 four format and create partitions on the drive do i use format or fdisk i  
 think that ide drives cannot be lowlevel formatted is it the same with  
 scsi how exactly does fdisk work i have a reduced msdos fivezero manual  
 clone obliges and there is no mention of fdisk  ideally i would want  
 the drive partitioned in to two partitions d and e how do i do this


do not low level format a scsi unless you have the scsi low level format program 
first use fdisk to set the partitions then use format


 well that seems to be all is there anythiing i am forgetting 
 any help is really appreciated i am lost

 as far as set the moral tone is concerned if a community does not
 collectively want to put up with prostitution going on in front of their
 kids why should they have to  if a community does not want to see
 proliferation of drugs among their kids why should they have to

  by what right and do tell from the standpoint of the drug
dealer or prostitute what is the difference if the gun is pointed
by the local hick city council or the feds
  if something is wrong it is wrong period if it is not
sustainable at a federal level why should it be ok just because
the geographical unit is smaller


peter nelson posted a very eloquent response to this point in 
talkpoliticsmisc so i need not consume more bandwidth here



 the problem with the egalitarian view is that it tries to deny the
 fundamental dilemma of democratic government  the people have a right
 to exercise a voice in their community yet individuals have the right
 to be left to themselves  this is a serious dilemma precisely because
 there is not much that takes place in a vacuum

  you are seriously misusing the word egalitarian you should
look the word up before you use it there is a vast difference
between equal justice under the law and egalitarianism

what i meant if it was not clear was the intersection set of liberal
and libertarian philosophies of natural rights and how the government
and constitutional interpretation in particular fits into that 
philosophy  this philosophy engages in the very serious practical 
error of endowing the nine lawyers on the supreme court with an almost 
totalitarian authority completely outside of the consent or consensus 
of the people  this is why supreme court nominations are such amazing
political fistfights these days because he who controls the court
rules the country  the people on the court may well be trying to do
the best job they can but they are at best a benevolent oligarch even
if you approve of every supreme court decision ever  eventually an
oligarch will arise that will decimate that which you hold dear  try 
supreme court cases by jury and the problem would be mitigated a great 
deal

those who would create broad nonenumerated government powers at any 
level as in european parlamentary democracies and the current defacto
standard in the yous have essentially engaged in the same fundamental 
mistake except that it is some different body that has the totalitarian 
virtually unchecked except by plurality election death or retirement 
government power 


  and why should your community be allowed to stop my activities
when i am not picking your pocket or defrauding you just because
you do not like it because you find it morally repugnant 

this is like asking why the wind blows unless you can prove that
the fact of your engaging in certain activities has absolutely no 
effect whatsoever on any other human being who has not consented to
your engagement in those activities  very few human activities indeed
fit into this category  

even for those few that do who would you empower to make the judgement 
of what is and is not a fully autonomous activity  who defines picking 
my pocket and defrauding  are economic assets a persons only assets
or are peace of mind stability confidence in a childs emotional 
environment security and many other things not also a part of a persons
assets  what gives you the right to create a moral environment that a
parent strongly objects to  what gives you the right to create an 
environment of social unrest and instability  if you say that what you
do does not have those effects by what authority do you say that  who
is empowered to make these value judgements


how 
would you feel if i got a gang together and found xtianity
or insert your favorite because here morally repugnant and
passed laws to outlaw its free exercise all at a local
level since that seems to be aok with you


if the federal constitution explicitly prohibited you from doing so the 
federal government would prevent you from doing so  if it did not and
you could muster enough local support to pass an amendment to the local
constitution by say a threefour majority empowering the local government 
to do so then i would have to vote with my feet and move to a neighborhood
more friendly to my own system of values  this is not an ideal situation
but it is far better than the mess we are mired in right now


 as to the gang of pitchfork and torch wielding friends there are very
 few restrictive local laws that i personally would advocate or vote for
 since i am of the view that exercising government power over your neighbors
 should be done with extreme care and only when absolutely necessary  but
 i do believe in protecting children from victimization by people who have
 callous disregard for the effects they have on others  i would certainly
 leave a wellbehaved massage parlor alone so long as it had no
 detrimental effects on the neighborhood

  you just do not get it the debate is not whether you or a
communitity would or would not vote away my rights it is
the propriety of whether that should even be an option

when you define rights very broadly there is no practical choice about 
whether people will or will not infringe upon your rights since these
rights overlap  even when rights are defined very narrowly the government 
has been empowered to prevent others from infringing on your rights  the 
fundamental question is by whose authority is that power created  if you 
support the current situation with a natural rights supreme court rather
than an original understanding supreme court or even better supreme
court by jury you are consenting to having nine lawyers in washington 
dc create those powers out of the air  in my fractal federalism scenario 
it is a broad consensus of the people ie the amendment process that 
creates those powers


 certainly not the only because mike but people in a local neighborhood
 should have a voice in what goes on in that neighborhood  to deny this
 is to create another concentrated centralized power to keep the locality
 from abusing its power

   you mean that horrific centralized power the individual

no i mean the federal government that comes trucking in with guns to
tell the locals how to run their neighborhood  waco tx is a nice example



 in essence using a pit bull to keep a toy poodle
 from biting your leg  chances are the pit bull is going to turn on you
 some day and you have much less defense against it than you do against
 the toy poodle  ideally everyone would leave everyone else alone and
 no government coercive power of any kind would be necessary  this will
 never work because people are different and by their nature they will
 always want to force their views on others  if this were not the case
 nobody would try to force their view that murder is wrong on anyone else

  fine when they force their views on others prosecute them
until then leave them alone this is such a simple concept
how do you feel about speech codes hate speech certainly
could be considered an indication that the pit bull is
going to turn some day should the community be allowed
to limit it too if not why not

if you create a community where public masturbation is permitted in the 
because of personal autonomy have you done anything different  what
precisely are these autonomous activities you are referring to  if you
list them perhaps we can get enough people to agree that they are truly
autonomous and pass a constitutional amendment protecting them



  and how do you feel about david koresh did he deserve
it should the batf or a local version of same be allowed
to toss him in jail just because they think he is off
his rocker

the koresh incident appears to be a horrendous abuse of government power
power possibly illegitimately obtained through a means i would abolish 
the constitutionality of noknock warrants seems very dubious to me not
to mention the mere existence of batf and the governments propensity to 
ignore the word infringe in the second amendment  this power is upheld 
by the same body with its incredible concentration of power in the hands 
of nine people that has upheld much socalled civil rights read affirmative 
action legislation despite the fourteenth amendment



   who said anything about the public till get rid of it and
 get out of my face
 

 i agree about getting rid of the public till  are you still sure you do not
 want to come over for coffee  you might not especially like my neighborhood
 and i might not especially like yours but at least we can agree to let each
 other live the kind of life we want to

  at the point you get rid of the public till you lose all
credibility as to why you should have a say about my private
affairs are you sure you are ready for that


money is certainly not the only asset i have in this world  if it were
this would be a bleak existence indeed

subject the armenians did not form a distinct race
replyto serazumauucp serdar argic
distribution world
lines one hundred and fortyseven

in article  eerginelunixamherstedu erdem erginel writes

my question is given so many separations in the armenian community what
was the common denominator of the armenian people that allowed armenian
nationalism to emerge in the nineteenth century as i stated religion

there are various contradictory views on the origin of the armenians
the name is to be found in the darian inscriptions in the form armina
or aramaniya is to be found in the inscription on the bistun monument
the following references to the armenians are to be found in the bistun
cuneiform inscription of dara vishdasb five hundred and ten bc

 one the monarch dara said i sent my servant to arminam armeniya

 six on reaching arminam armeniya

 seven to the country town of zozo to armaniya armeniya

according to karakashian

as for armenia the equivalent of the armin or arminik of the persians
this is more recent than the word ararat and is to be found used in
the dara inscriptions for haiastan  

saint martin

the name armenie has been given since very early times by almost all
the various eastern peoples to the territory referred to by the armenians
as haiastan it was known to the syrians as armenia and to the arabs
as ermeniyye
 
others believe that urartu was known in the time of the medes as harminap
which was later modified by the persians to arminia ar refers to a
place as in ararat archish aruyr archar arshav arazen and aror 
while men is used to refer to spirit thought or human being and 
therefore armen would appear to signify the people of that place

g alishan believes that according to our national vocabulary haik
is the diminutive form of hai and that hai is the name of our
nation our nation is in no way connected with the word armen that
foreigners apply to our people

it would thus appear that armenia is a placename that armen is 
the name of the people who lived there and that these are in no way
connected with the word hai

haik and haiastan

armenian historians believe haik to have been a great hero from whom
the armenian people took the name hai but the mere resemblance
between the words haik and hai constitutes no real proof and
in any case no such theory appears before the time of moses of
khoren

haiasa

the following studies show quite clearly that hai and haiasa were
no more than general names used by the hittites to refer to the 
region known as armenia

professor hachadurian haiasa was the general name used in hittite
inscriptions for upper armenia

yensen in his hittites and armenians tries to prove that hai is
identical with the hittite hatio in other words that hai is a
hittite word research however has proved this erroneous and shown
that hai was derived from hatio

mortmans attempt to read the urartu inscriptions as armenian met with 
no success as for greek there is no point in even mentioning it

the resemblance between the words haiasa and haiastan is so obvious
that we may well accept haiasa as the oldest form of haiastan

let us now cast a brief glance on how the words hai haikazan and
haiastan entered our older works

according to karakashian 

the word haik is never to be found employed with reference to a
leader of the armenian people prior to moses of khoren nor is it
ever found employed in the forms haika or haykazn

agahangelos and puzant use the word as a title or a placename he
improved and developed haiastan etc if the word had referred
to a nation and had been derived from hai or haik they could 
also have used the words haikak and haykazn in a number of
places

according to professor sayce who deciphered a number of hittite 
inscriptions

in the hittite language the suffix ha is used to specify quality
or species the words haddanas haddina were used by the 
assyrians to refer to the hittites with the transformation of the
d between the two a letters to y hadinasdani was in this
way transformed to haiastan

professor grechmer fully agrees with this point of view but regards
the significance and explanation so far accorded to the terms hai
and haistan as quite unsatisfactory he finds however that a 
solution to this problem is brought nearer by the name haiasa 
which is so frequently found in bogazkoy from one thousand four hundred bc onwards
forrer takes haiasa as referring to upper armenia in that case
it seems likely that haiasa was actually a part of armenia the
suffix dan is of anatolian origin the real root is hayasa which
refers to the country of the hayasas

e chantre writes as follows on the subject of the ethnological 
and anthropological characteristics of the armenian people

the armenians in russia may be characterized as follows almost
all of them are brachycephalic or leptocephalic very dark
above average height an aissores asian group with close ties
with certain kurdish tribes and azerbaijan peoples

according to j deniker

from the philological point of view the armenian and kurds may be
regarded as belonging to the iranian groupthe armenians are 
descended from various elements and from a very mixed race their
average height varies between onesixtythree and onesixtynine according to the region
they are almost always shortheaded with skull measurements of 
eightyfiveeightyseven as a race they belong to the indoafghanassyrianturkic
family

professor rene vernont writes as follows

the armenians are a mixture of semites turk kurds and mongols
but some of them display armenian features eg height a little
above average fair complexion dark hair dark eyes very often
a hooked nose and a rather wide mouth 

investigations carried out by n kossovitch on the links between
armenian blood groups and their anthropological characteristics
led him to the conclusion that the armenians did not form a 
distinct race

both of my senators and my rep  i also called the white house
comment line was on hold for eightten minutes so maybe lots of people
are calling  please call your congress critterwh comment line now
 
 	just a general note i have seen several polls lately and they
 show a large majority a thinks that this incident was handled ok and
 b thinks that the fbi and batf gave them more than enough time fiftyone days
 to come out

i take it that when something happens that is wrong it is okay if
a bunch of people say it is  for instance if some people go on a
murderous rampage and lynch some blacks and then a poll is taken which
shows that the majority of people think that this is acceptable then
does this mean that what these people have done is not bad  this is an
example of mob rule not a democracya democracy in which peoples
rights are protected  i hope that i have made myself clear on this

make the following points

 one your outrage over todays behaviour
 
 	and what if i am not outraged

fineyou have the right to hold any opinion that you want to  but
let me ask you this  are you outraged over this tragedy  i hope
that you are your opinions of david koresh and his followers not
withstanding  i know i am

 two since batf chief higgens and janet reno were the two who signed off
    on this plan demand that they be fired
 
 	actually they should both be commended

why  i would be interested in hearing your reasons

 five point out that even if the fire was set by someone inside of the
    building it came as a direct result of the actions of the fbibatf
    and the people inside including seventeen children deserved a trial instead
    of this
 
 	what i want to know is what exactly did you expect them to do  i
 can see it nowthe eleven of the clock news  fbi and batf agents still
 surround the waco compound after four hundred and fiftyone days  i do not think so  they gave
 them every chance  they had fiftyone days to surrender to proper authorities
 they had attornies representing them etc  koresh lied time and time again
 i do not wish them dead but you cannot let it stalemate forever  it was time
 to do something and the fbi and batf did  what happened was unfortunate
 but acceptable as long as the fbi did not set the fire intentionally

i think that everything else being equal it is not too much to ask that
if a weeknight game can be shortened by halfanhour by cutting out warmup
pitches dawdling outside the batters box commercial timeouts and that
sort of thing i am not asking for too much

how do you know they can be shortened by halfanhour  has anybody done a
study to determine how much time is actually wasted  say in these as
games

oh probably

ms nichols has given the average game times and average runs scored for
one thousand nine hundred and eightythree and one thousand nine hundred and ninetytwo  a very nice piece of information ms nichols  who knows
she may be listening and not have me in her kill file after all  those
numbers indicate somewhere in the neighborhood of halfarun less being
scored per game and the games taking fifteen minutes longer  something is
being done now that was not done ten years ago which is extending the games
by fifteen minutes  ms nichols thinks it is more pitches  given the increasing
specialization of pitchers it would not surprise me

if it is not simply more pitches though i do not think it is unreasonable
to think that something can be done to get ten of those minutes back  then
i get a couple more from shortening the warmup time for a relief pitcher
after he comes in and a couple more still from enforcing existing rules
which have been stated in other posts in this thread and other related ones

the problem is who decides whether that time is wasted  you do not seem
to think it is at all  right now i think it is although i have heard one
case favoring giving the reliever all the warmups he thinks he needs the
difference in mounds between the field and pen  but who knows  if the
rules get changed maybe something i did not foresee will happen to change my
mind  but you can bet a lot of minds would fail to foresee the same thing
or else nothing will be changed

greetings recmotorcyclists

coming up labour day weekend this year worldcon world science fiction
convention will be held in san francisco california  i am planning
to attend and have been speculating on doing my trip there by motorcycle
instead of by plane as was my initial thought 

i live and would be departing from ottawa ontario canada

i had planned to take two weeks for this trip giving me five days travel
time on either side of the weekend

this looks like a distance of about two thousand eight hundred miles four thousand five hundred km

if your distance calc is correct for an on the road distance and not
as the crow flies this is nine hundredkm a day for five days  if you spend the
entire time on interstates which would be a total waste of time that is
at least eight hours on the road every day not including eatingpeeing
sightseeing etc

i was contemplating a similar trip but from ottawa to la or
maybe ottawa to austin tx  

i figured if i want to do a trip of this magnitude and enjoy it i would
have to get my ass off the major interstates and spend lots of
time enjoying the country around me ie stopping with a camera
meeting townspeople going to a few bars  no sense spending two weeks
looking out a helmet with the closest human contact found at the gas
pump

i estimated i would need at least fourfive weeks to make the trip worthwhile

i am looking for input opinions comments or snarky remarks on
one my sanity

in question eight

two suggested routes  note getting there is important and my
   schedule does not leave a lot of room for side trips or circuitous
   routes

try and stay off the interstates

five anybody who wants to join me on this trip  for even part of the
   distance

depending on your route and my plans i may be heading that way as far
as at least detroit

seven anything that comes to mind and that you think might be relevant


call the whithorse pess  they are a book distributer catering to
motorcyclists  they have a large number of books highlighting
the best roads for motorcyclists along the general route
you are looking at  they carry listings of bed and breakfasts
all through the states which accept motorcyclists  order their free
catalog and within you will probably find books covering absolutely
all you needs for this trip  their s in the motorcyclist andor

xsender newtout zeroeight feb twentythree one thousand nine hundred and ninetythree
lines fiftyone

          introducing the back to the moon in congress
                          the next step
                          
        the next key hurdle for the lunar resources data purchase 
act is introduction of the act in congress at this point  many
congresspersons have been approached about the bill however
for a successful effort to pass the bill we need the best
possible congressperson to introduce the bill due to his
position as chair of the house committee on space and science
congressman george brown is the logical choice he has a long
record of support and interest in space development and helped
pass the launch services purchase act and the space settlements
act                      
        there is a small group of activists in southern california 
who have assisted george brown in his recent reelection campaigns
we are mobilizing this group to have them tell congressman brown
about the back to the moon bill we are also asking prospace
constituents to let him know that they care about getting
america back to the moon
        finally there is a good chance that a nationwide alert 
for space activists to call or write george brown to have him
introduce the back to the moon bill may be staged during late
spring one thousand nine hundred and ninetythree
        all this should produce a positive reaction from browns
office as more is known it will be passed on
        however even if we are successful in getting him to support
the bill  this alone will not ensure passage of the bill for
any bill to become law one of three conditions must exist
either the bill must reflect widespread national support for an
issue such as extension of unemployment insurance benefits be
propelled by highpriced lobbyists we are out of luck there or
have widespread support within congress due to small but
widespread constituent support the latter is the path that we
by necessity must choose                    
        this means that the introduction of the lunar resources 
data purchase act must be immediately accompanied by a large number
of congresspersons sponsorship of the bill  to accomplish
this we need activists to ask their congressperson to support
the lunar resources data purchase act  now to wait until the
bill is introduced is simply too late  it takes time to have a
congresspersons staff review a bill
        if your congressperson mentions that the bill is not yet
introduced please elicit their opinion of the bill as currently
written we appreciate all comments on the bill from activists
and politicians
        if you have yet to see the back to the moon bill please
request a copy by email please include your yous postal service
address or contact your local chapter of the national space

 wood is fairly small for an enforcertype i mean fleury does a pretty good
 job and is not that large but dody is no fleury 

and fleury is no enforcer an agitator for sure but fleury never has and never
will have a fight which seems to be what you are saying wood is 

the closest fleury ever came to fighting was a game two years ago against
los angeles there was a scrum and mcsorley pinched fleurys head under his
arm fleury dropped his gloves and gave mcsorley a weak shot to the side of the
head mcsorely knowing a good thing when he saw one popped fleury one right
between the eyes end of fight fleury got ten stitches for his trouble

 well the obvious point to make is would straight men fuck like rabbits
 if the oppertunity presented itself

 i reckon any man would go wildly promiscuous if presented with a
 huge variety of willing partners

if true and if gays were the same as straights except
for sexual preference i would imagine that gays would
have much less sex than straights because the available
pool for dates is less than onetenth what it is for
straights  somebody correct flame me please


you miss the point  a lot more negotiation is needed to convince women
to have sex because there is a big taboo about women being free with 
their sex  many of the women i know would do almost anything rather
than be known as a slag slut or whore

with men however there is status attached to being able to fuck 
constantly  and with gay men where both partners can prove status
through their constant verility then you are going to get a situation
where there is a lot of sex

the difference is between het sex being rationed as a valuable commodity
and gay sex being virtually unlimited due to the appetites of men

straights suffer a bottle neck where women are concerned gay men who
do not experience this bottle neck go to excess

rbungeaccessdigexnet robert bunge writes

it is vandalism because many people  power companies  do maliciously waste light 

maliciously implies evil intent  the lighting companies are not going out
of their way to spoil the sky  they just do not care

if they can sell you
or your city or your state an unshielded light that wastes thirty to fifty percent
of its light they make more money  never mind that your money is wasted

it is the responsibility of the customer to choose the most efficient hardware
if that is what your city will buy that is what the lighting company will sell
write a letter to city hall

that is fine idea but it only works if the lightingpower company even bothers to supply good light fixtures  for instance a power company in virginia 
recently asked a state commission for permission to sell more lights of various
type  yet all of the different fixture that they sold and wanted to sell
were bad designs  one that wasted the light  thus you could not even buy
a good light from them  in most places to get a good light you have to
either order it special at high cost or call a store in arizona  at some
point society starts to make rules  cars have to pass safety tests  
companies have to meet pollution standards etc  there are two ways to achieve this  educate the public so that they demand good lighting or force code
down the lighting companies backs  history seems to suggest that the latter
is more likely to work


please note that i am not defending light pollution  the orignial focus of 
this thread was space based light sources

agreed so i will not respond again  it is important for all you spacers out 
there to realize that some people will object to various wild ideas that 
have been presented  just like congress it would be best to consult
the astronomerslovers of the night sky before you try some pr stunt
to boost public knowledge about space

he is a canadian thing altogether  seriously what is he all about  i

he is a canadian thing former coach of the boston bruins and colorado
rockies from the summaries that get posted i gather that his ongoing beef
this year has been the conventional wisdom that canadian hockey is doomed
to be second or third rate behind the perceived emergence of the yous
and european programs

know he was a coach at one time and from the volume of posts about him
someone surely is getting a steady diet of him somehow but my question
is what is the deal with him  secondly are the comments of his that i

after he left the rockies he got a job with cbcs hockey night in canada
and has not looked back since actually he did work for cbc at least
on playoff season after the rockies were eliminated

read about on the net merely flame bait or do people actually take him
seriously  i got to tell you from what i see he really sounds like an

i would say it is a combination of flame bait and serious journalism the closest
thing you will find to cherry in the yous is stan fischler a selfdescribed
hockey maven the similarities are that they both say things that get
people upset the difference is that cherry knows the game and fischler
does not

 anyone be worse than that
 
 i will not explain this to you again stalin did nothing in the name of
 atheism whethe he was or was not an atheist is irrelevant
 
 get a grip man  the stalin example was brought up not as an
 indictment of atheism but merely as another example of how people will
 kill others under any name that is fit for the occasion

no look again while you never said it the implication is pretty clear
i am sorry but i can only respond to your words not your true meaning usenet
is a slippery medium

 so hard atheism has nothing to prove  then how does it justify that
 god does not exist  i know there is the faq etc  but guess what  if
 those justifications were so compelling why are not people flocking to
 hard atheism  they are not and they will not  i for one will discourage
 people from hard atheism by pointing out those very sources as reliable
 statements on hard atheism
 
look i am not supporting any dogmatic position i would be a fool to say that
in the large group of people that are atheists no people exist who wish to
proselytize in the same fashion as religion how many hard atheists do you 
see posting here anyway maybe imm just not looking hard enough

 second what makes you think i am defending any given religion  i am merely
 recognizing hard atheism for what it is a faith

i never meant to do so although i understand where you might get that idea
i was merely using the bible example as an allegory to illustrate my
point

 
 and yes by we i am referring to every reader of the post  where is the
 evidence that the poster stated that he relied upon

evidence for what who i think i may have lost this thread
 
why theists are arrogant deleted
 because they say suchandsuch is absolutely unalterably true because
          
 my dogma says it is true i am not prepared to issue blanket statements
 indicting all theists of arrogance as you are will not to do with atheists
 
 bzzt  by virtue of your innocent little pronoun they you have just issued
 a blanket statement  at least i will apologize by qualifying my original
 statement with hard atheist in place of atheist  would you call john the
 baptist arrogant who boasted of one greater than he  that is what many
 christians do today  how is that in itself arrogant

guilty as charged what i meant to say was the theists who are arrogant
are this way because they say   other than that i thought my meaning
was clear enough any position that claims itself as superior to another with
no supporting evidence is arrogant thanks for your apology by the way

 before folks jump on me let me ask the net  would the jays
 have won the al with a good pitcher from aaa in place of morris given
 his run support  how about an average ml pitcher  i cannot believe
 that morris performance in the playoffs and series had a large positive
 impact on the jays performance 
i know it is very trendy nowadays to dump on morris but let us give credit
where credit is due
it is doubtful that the blue jays would have won the al east without morris
last year when the team went thirteenfifteen for the month of august and all the 
other starters were being shelled and milwaukee was making a charge
morris went fiveone with a pretty good era i cannot remember exactly
also let us not underestimate the importance his two hundred and forty innings to save 
the bullpen every fifth day  if he did not help us win the al east forget
about the pennent and the world series

a guy who threw two hundred and forty innings with about six run lower era would have saved the
bullpen even more say somebody like frank viola two hundred and thirtyeight innings

his run support was high fiveninetyeight runs but so was stottlemyers fiveninety runs
and he won only twelve games  i do remember morris winning an inordinate number of
sixfive and eightsix ballgames but this is to his credit  he pitched only as good
as he needed to be  when he was up sixone in a ballgame he just put it in cruise
control and threw the ball up there and let the batters get themseleves out
i hate this expression  an inexperienced pitcher would wear himself out 
trying to make perfect pitches to keep his era down  but morris being a 
veteran pitcher knows that winning is the only thing that really matters in
baseball  by saving himself he was able to reach back for that little extra
i hate this too when the game was on the line

have you by chance taken a look at the boxscores from last year to
determine the accuracy of your account i seem to recall morris getting at
least three or four wins last year when the jays came back from behind after they
had decided to pull morris at the end of an inning

my questions are has anyone hadheard of success in using this approach
her values have been slowly but steadily sinking any comment on the
probability of improvement although the doctor has told her to eat
normally my wife has dieted vigorously to keep her weight as she feels
that is part of keeping an edge over the illnesscondition may this

ignore the attacks and look at the sales numbers and the ms
stock price if you need some 
gratification just keep doing the great job you have done in the past
thanks dave l

this is the part that usually gets me while i am set to make money there usually
are other things to be considered and debated that is the purpose of life
if you only willing to look at the stock price and sales numbers for gratification
usually you will end up with japanese or whoever that is competitive owing your
business  ie shortsighted i am going to this is very irresponsible narrow minded and
selfish henceforth ignoring the attack is not the right approach as a matter of
fact i just happen to believe the willingness to debate and readjust is the
greatest assets of this society sales number and stock price is the shortterm

i have osteoarthritis and my huband has just been diagnosed with diabetes
type ii i guessno insulin 


i have been trying to read up on these two conditions and what really
surprises me is how few experiments have been done and how little is known 
losing weight appears to be imperative for diabetes and advisable for
arthritis at least for women with arthritis but of course the very
conditions that make weight loss advisable are part of the reason for the
weight gain 

for myself i am almost afraid to lose weight because no matter how gentle
and sensible a diet i use the last one was one thousand eight hundredtwo thousand calories in about
eight small meals the weight will not go off gradually and stay off 
instead it drops off precipitously and then comes back on with much
interest like bread on the waters


with this experience it is hard to be encouraging to my husband  all i can
suggest is to make it as gradual as possible

meanwhile some experts recommend no sugar others no fat others just a
balanced diet  it is almost impossible to tell from their writings which
parts of their recommendations are supposed to help the condition and
which are merely ideas the expert thinks are nifty

is it my imagination or are these very old conditions very poorly
understood  is it just that i am used to pediatriciantalk it is strep
give him this and he will get well and so my expectations are too high

with spring upon us it is time to start waxing again  i was wondering if anyone
had any suggestions about waxes and polishes  i know carnuba wax is often 
recommended on the net but i was wondering about the colored waxes to cover up
some minor scratches  do the colored waxes give on overall good quality shine
are they good for the paint or clear coat

what about liquid glass is it a clear polish which dries clear thus filling
scratches  is it good for the paintclear coat

please post with both good and bad experiences  and hey let us name names 
brands here  


all gimmicks  stick with plain old carnauba wax that is nonabrasive
eagle one meguiars turtle wax and a few others are good examples
the colored waxes just color in the scratches so they are not so 
apparent  the better approach is to buff minor scratches completely
off with a cleanermild abrasive

never tried liquid glass although i still have this sample they sent
me a few years back

wells gets the win he is now threezero with an era just under one and henneman gets
his third save in three chances  ken rogers started for the rangers and 
gets the loss  he was relieved by burns in the seventh

the rangers got their only run on a solo home run by dean palmer in the seventh
the tigers opened the scoring with an rbi single by fryman in the threerd then
took the lead for good in the bottom of the seventh when whitaker greeted
reliever burns with an rbi double which scored tettleton  whitaker in turn
crossed the plate on an rbi single by phillips who has been red hot for 
the third tiger run

this afternoon it is another battle of southpaws bill krueger for the tigers

inreplyto thirtyfour thousand six hundred and sixtysixoasysdtnavymil

in my opinion the limited tort option is the best thing casey has ever
done basically limited tort means that you give up your right to sue
for pain and suffering unless one of the following conditions is met
one your medical bills resulting from the accident exceed x where x is
some number like fiftyzero  i am not sure of the exact number

two the accident was caused by a drunk driver i mean the other driver
was drunk

three you get a good lawyer and have a good case basically you can appeal
to regain your right to sue but there is almost no chance of this ever
happening

you are only giving up your right to sue for pain and suffering you can
still sue for medical costs actual damages etc by agreeing to limited
tort you are essentially giving up your right to be an asshole who
treats every accident as an entry into the litigation lottery in
exchange you get a substantial reduction in your rates i save
one hundred and fiftyyear

unfortunately the insurance companies have managed to scare and confuse
people so much that only about five of pennsylvanians go for limited tort
i guess that is ok  if more people opted for it the insurance
companies would be pushing harder for repeal

muslims helping the nazis  where on earth do you come up with such
accuusation  do you have proofs  if not you should publically apologize
for such a statement  

what a dope  there is no value for mohammed elabdellaoui to be here
at a western university  thirdworldist and islamic brainrot has
made it impossible for him to acquire and analyze facts appropriately

and is there a reason or value for such a brainless shit for brains asshole
to be haer  you are a self hating bastard  neither your name nor your
ideas which i have come across before and thought were too stupid and 
uncivlized to respond to prove your firstworldist claim and civility


the history of the efforts of the mufti of jerusalem to serve the
nazis in the south balkans and set up muslim ss divisions is
welldocumented  in general nazism and the leaderprinciple
resonated well among muslim peoples  khomeinis concept of the faqih
is a recent example of such resonance  in fact totalitarianism is
etymologically a reasonable translation islam

to be fair the mufti did not succeed in getting large numbers of
muslims to join the ss  but the rather small muslim ss unit did
manage to commit attrocities disproportionate to it size  there were
also muslim people who were less than enthusiastic about the attempt
of muslim leaders to entice muslim people to serve the nazi because
actively  and the turkish government ignored practically all nazi
overtures even though an alliance with the nazis against the soviet
government would have made a great deal of tactical sense

give me sources to read it or shut up  you think i will take such an
ignorant as yourself on his words


			last time i heard the nazis prided themselves in
needing no body to carry their politics and ideologies  and if your statment
were true do not you think israel would of used it to point to what a muslim
neighbor palestine could do to them if they allowed it to be  the jewish
lobby and power is very strong and if what you said is true we would of
heard it from them before you could come up with it
and you dare say that you are taking no sides

yes the typical primitive muslim psychopathological psychotic
behavior upon hearing or reading a disagreeable fact  start whining
about the jews  what a jerk


there is nothing primitive about islam except in your mind  i do read and
live daily with disagreable facts and i only ask them to prove themselves
the last time i checked this was truly a onestworldist civilized approach to
facts and figures  i did not whine about  the jews i merely stated a fact
thet is strange to nobody  as far as me being jerk fuck you  sorry to
other people that read this

 that is not very good odds

i kind of doubt that any revolution armed or otherwise was ever started

discussion on piracy deleted
 
 off deeper end why does everyone think they need to be able to make a 
 backup copy almost all new software must be installed to the hard disk
 so you are left with the originals as your backups i think its a waste
 of time space and money as well as it makes it to tempting to lend
 out the backups 
 
my own practice with new software 

make a copy of the original floppies to a second set of floppies

install to hard drive from second set of floppies

put originals in a box in room number one

put copies in box in room number two

one accidents do happen to original floppies
two accidents can happen to the installation floppy
three sometimes software goes out on floppies that are just marginally good  or
   gets too close to a magnet in shipping or storage

i have had experience with something like the last  i purchased a compiler from
a reputable vendor  the debugger in the package just would not install to the
hard drive no way  repeated floppytofloppy copies finally got a clean read
of the disk  i do not recall if i used diskcopy copyb or xcopy

i made a second copy of the marginal floppy and installed from that  no problenms  except with my typing    since

i regard backup floppies as cheap insurance

just my side of the question

 i do not believe you i said but followed to a nailstudded door the 
  man pushed it ajar then spurred away leaving me to check on the corpse 
  i thought i should this charge was so constant so gritted my teeth and 
  went inside

 the place was cool but reeked of sodden ashes and was dark at first for 
 its stone walls had only window slits rags strewed the mud floor around an 
 iron tripod over embers that vented their smoke through roof beams black 
 with soot all looked bare and empty but in an inner room flies buzzed as 
 the door swung shut behind me i saw they came from a mans body lying face 
 up naked but for its grimy turban he was about fifty years old by what 
 was left of his face  a rifle butt had bashed an eye the one left slanted 
 as with tartars rather than with turks any uniform once on him was gone so 
 i would no proof which he was and quickly went out gagging at the mess of his  
 slashed genitals

p three hundred and sixtythree first paragraph 

 how many people lived there
 oh about eight hundred he yawned
 did you see any turk officers
 no sir i was in at dawn all were tartar civilians in mufti

 the lieutenant dozed off then i but in the small hours a voice woke me  
 dros he stood in the starlight bawling out an officer anyone keelhauled
 so long and furiously i would never heard then abruptly dro broke into 
 laughter quick and simple as childs both were a cover for his sense
 of guilt i thought or hoped for somehow despite my boast of irreligion
 christian massacring infidels was more horrible than the reverse would
 have been

 from daybreak on armenian villagers poured in from miles around
 the women plundered happily chattering like ravens as they picked over
 the carcass of djul they hauled out every hovels chattels the last 
 scrap of food or cloth and staggered away packing pots saddlebags 
 looms even spinningwheels

 thank you for a lot dro i said to him back in camp but now i must 
 leavewe shook hands the captain said a bientot mon camarade and 
 for hours the old molokan scout and i plodded north across parching plains 
 like lots wife i looked back once to see smoke bathing all doubtless in 
 a sack of other moslem villages up to the line of snow that was iran

p three hundred and fiftyfour

at morning tea dro and his officers spread out a map of this whole
 high region called the karabakh deep in tactics they spoke russian
 but i got their contempt for allied neutral zones and their distrust
 of promises made by tribal chiefs a campaign shaped more raids on
 moslem villages

p three hundred and fiftyeight

it will be three hours to take dro told me we would close in on three
 sides
the men on foot will not shoot but use only the bayonets merrimanov
said jabbing a rifle in dumbshow
that is for morale dro put in we must keep the moslems in terror
soldiers or civilians i asked
there is no difference said dro all are armed in uniform or not
but the women and children
will fly with the others as best they may

p three hundred and sixty

the ridges circled a wide expanse its floors still hundreds of feet 
 down the fog held solid as cotton flock djul lies under that said 
 dro pointing our men also attack from the other sides

 then wheeee  his whistle lined up all at the rock edge bayonets
 clicked upon carbines over plunged archo his black haunches rippling
 then followed the staff the horde  nose to tail bellies taking the
 spur armenia in action seemed more like a pageant than war even though 
 i heard our utica brass roar

 as i watched from the height it took ages for djul to show clear a tsing
 of machinegun fire took over from the thumping batteries cattle lowed
 dogs barked invisible while i ate a hunk of cheese and drank from a snow
 puddle mist at last folded upward as men shouted at first heard faintly
 the came a shrill wailing

 now among the cloudstreaks rose darker wisps  smoke red glimmered about
 house walls of stone or wattle into dry weeds on roofs a mosque stood in
 clump of trees thick and green through crooked alleys on fire horsemen
 were galloping after figures both mounted and on foot

 tartarski shouted the gunner by me others pantomimed them in escape
 over the rocks while one twisted a bronze she willnose loaded and yanked
 breechcord firing again and again shots wasted i thought when by
 afternoon i looked in vain for fallen branch or body but these shots and
 the white bursts of shrapnel in the gullies drowned the womens cries

 at length all shooting petered out i got on my horse and rode down toward
 djul it burned still but little flame showed now the way was steep and 
 tough through dense scrub finally on flatter ground i came out suddenly
 through alders on smoldering houses across trampled wheat my brothersin
 arms were leading off animals several calves and a lamb

p three hundred and sixtyone fourth paragraph

corpses came next the first a pretty child with straight black hair 
 large eyes she looked about twelve years old she lay in some stubble 
 where meal lay scattered from the sack she would been toting the bayonet 
 had gone through her back i judged for blood around was scant between 
 the breasts one clot too small for a bullet wound crusted her homespun 
 dress

 the next was a boy of ten or less in rawhide jacket and kneepants he 
 lay face down in the path by several huts one arm reached out to the 
 pewter bowl he would carried now upset upon its dough steel had jabbed 
 just below his neck into the spine 

 there were grownups too i saw as i led the sorrel around djul was

all this despite lots of attempts to hide the designs  there are lots

here is a summary of don cherrys coachs corner from april twentyone one thousand nine hundred and ninetythree
the game being broadcast in my region was la and calgary although
i think it was filmed during the torontodetroit game that night

warning antifighting people may want to skip this post

topics


dons tie grant fuhr penalties wings vs leafs fighting dale hunter

episode summary


this episode began with the camera zoomed in on dons tie don was
pointing out the characters on the tie bugs bunny foghorn leghorn
and yosemite sam who don called lanny macdonald

ron maclean began by mentioning that don was almost evicted from a
hotel where he was watching the previous nights games because of
all the yelling and cheering he was doing over the play of hunter
and fuhr

don began to praise fuhr calling him the greatest goalie and
said that he is winning the series against boston all by himself
he then showed clips from earlier episodes november fourteen january sixteen when
fuhr was still with the leafs and don advised do not trade fuhr

don went on to predict that if buffalo gets by boston it would
be fuhr who wins the series muckler took a lot of heat for the
trade but don feels mucklers been vindicated

the next topic involved how playoff games are being ruined by
too many penalty calls he showed a clip from a winnipegvancouver
game where domi hit a vancouver player and was given a two min penalty
ron said that it was called a penalty because his stick was involved
but don stuck with the opinion that it was a good hit with domi
hitting the vancouver player with his shoulder don its sad what
they are doing for hockey a five minute penalty for a nosebleed

next they went to the playoff series between detroit and toronto
people in detroit were calling wendel clarke wendy for not fighting
however don pointed out that probert was not fighting either

this lead don into a tirad about fighting and stickwork and how
banning fighting leads to more high sticking it is like college
hockey the little wee guy with the visor is brave as anybody
that is why you are seeing so much stickwork because they know you
will not drop your gloves and give them a shot the rules are made
by people who do not know what is going on in hockey

the final topic don discussed was dale hunter don pointed out
that he was leading the league in goals and showed a clip
of hunter from a previous game when he was younger hunter was
taught to play to win which differs from todays idea of
just letting kids have fun

at then end of the episode they showed a clip from a coachs
corner with the tape on fast forward so that don sounded like
one of the chipmunks

when elizabeth greeted mary elizabeth said something to the effect that
mary out of all women was blessed  if so it appears that this
exactly places mary beyond the sanctification of normal humanity

i do not see how this logically follows  true enough mary received a blessing
beyond any granted in all the history of humanity by being privileged to be 
the mother of the savior  it says nothing about mary needing to be a blessed 
person first in order that she might thereby be worthy to bear the son of 
god  again i think the problem is that as humans we cannot comprehend how the 
sinless incarnation could spring from sinful human flesh and gods spirit
rather than simply accept the gracious miracle of god we must needs try
to dope out a mechanism or rationale as to how this could be  marys own
words 

my spirit rejoices in god my savior for he has regarded the low
 estate of his handmaiden

sound like the words of a human aware of her own humanity in need of a 
savior similar to what david proclaimed in his psalmsnot the words
of a holy being with no further need for gods grace

i really apologize for harping on this i do not suppose it is important
it is just that i see mary and joseph and the baby reduced to placid
serene figurines i feel we lose the wonder in the fact that god chose
to come down to you and i to be born of people like you and i to share
our existence and redeem us from it is fallenness by his holy incarnation

 was it a noknock i really have not heard anything on that but clearly

it was a noknock according to the associated press report
here is something i found in my collection

    excerpts from an article in the knoxville newssentinel final

    waco texas  fierce gun battles erupted sunday as more than one hundred
    law officers tried to arrest the leader of a heavily armed
    religious cult  at least four federal agents and two cult members
    were reported killed  

    the gun battles began when federal agents hidden in livestock
    trailers stormed the sects headquarters sunday morning
             
    witnesses said  the agents had warrants to search for guns and
    explosives and to arrest howell said les stanford of the atf in
    washington  

    witnesses said the law officers stormed the compounds main home
    throwing concussion grenades and screaming come out while three
    
    national guard helicopters approached  for a moment there was no
    response  then the shooting began 

i think storming the sects headquaters and throwing concussion
grenades qualifies as a noknock or perhaps an illegal assault

 he was not just another guy minding his own business hell give them all
 the guns in the world if they do not bother anyone but he was a scary sort
 do not you think the sort of person you would want your daughter to date i
                   
probably not  but then again neither are you

 then he fired on the atf that is not just a little mistake or some
 redwhiteand blue american defending his home against big brother that
 shit does not fly anyone with his background that will shoot and kill
                    
and just what is his background  what prior crimes had he been
convicted of

 what is the policy regarding players and the minor league playoffs versus wc
 i know that the rangers are holding back kovalev zubov and andersson for
 binghamton but i also know that the whalers wanted michael nylander to play
 for springfield while nylander wanted to play for sweden the whalers allowed
 the nhl to decide and the nhl chose the wcs how does this differ from the
 rangers and oilers did the whalers have to go through the league or could
 they have forced nylander to play in springfield

as long as a player is under contract to an organization he is obligated to
play only where that organization tells him to play or gives him permission
to play the rangers are certainly within their rights to force zubov and
andersson to report to binghampton 

it certainly does reflect a lack of class on the part of the ranger 
organization however is having binghampton win the calder cup really more
important to them than keeping their players happy

 the color of the board shows the composition of it hence the use of it
 
 original and older boards were bakelite composition and were brown
 phenolic spelling was a tan
 most non filled fiberglass boards used in computers are green
 filled fiberglass is blue
 teflon is white
 
 
 rubbish the reason for the colour of the boards depends on the solder
 mask that is used older boards bakelite and phenolic rarely used
 a solder mask these boards are not suited well to automatic stuffing
 and soldering techniques and hence are the colour of the compound
 used to make them these days boards are made of fibreglass for most
 general purpose uses and have a solder mask applied to them to prevent
 close traces shorting to one another during soldering and also to prevent
 the decomposition of traces under harsh environments the light and dark
 green boards ofter seen have a dry film mask applied to them usually
 applied as a complete film photographically produced the blue and red
 or orange boards are a twopart epoxy or a liquidimageable resist
 formulation and are applied in a different manner there is a lot of info
 about the pros and cons of each but that is another story

sorry geoff

agree solder mask is green but in the old days we did not have wave soldering
machines which are another topic again  i had a crew of a dozen ladies which
could stuff and hand solder a board like lightning

board under the mask was the original query

by the way cheap inport electronic devices mainly from threerd world countries are done
with brown pheonolic boards  is seems the electronics industry has discovered
the cheap labor pools  workers are paid by the board to assemble circuits at
home  they are very obviously hand soldered  quite a few tape recorders are
being brought into canada from red china  in china there is no warranty for
the equipment other than if you plug it in and it works it is yours  one of my
coworkers spent a year there and he said the failure rate out of the box was
almost fifty

also the original method for making printed with conductive ink on a regular
printing press  an old lithographer friend had a press for this  after the
etching method was developed he used the press to print wood grain on doors

hi everyone
           i am a commited christian that is battling with a problem  i know
that romans talks about how we are saved by our faith not our deeds yet
hebrews and james say that faith without deeds is useless saying you fools
do you still think that just believing is enough

now if someone is fully believing but there life is totally lead by themselves
and not by god according to romans that person is still saved by there faith
but then there is the bit which says that god preferes someone who is cold to
him ie does not know him  condemned so a lukewarm christian someone who
knows and believes in god but does not make any attempt to live by the bible

now i am of the opinion that you a saved through faith alone not what you do
as taught in romans but how can i square up in my mind the teachings of james
in conjunction with the lukewarm christian being spatout

can anyone help me this really bothers me

andysailstanfordedu andy freeman says

this is where freemans love of accuracy becomes really ridiculous

good  now let us look at those sections  they will prove my point

his point was that it is possible under certain circumstances for many people
to carry concealed in illinois

     a  a person commits the offense of unlawful use of weapons when he
knowingly

four  carries or possesses in any vehicle or concealed on or about his person
     except when on his land or in his own abode or fixed place of business
     any pistol revolver stun gun or taser or other firearm

note that this does not affect all concealed carry  look after the
word except  it always helps to read the law before commenting on
it

i did read the law before i commented on it  judging from replies i received
about my semantics on tpg post many if not most people here on tpg
assume that when ccw laws are asked about the person is asking about the
possibility of an ordinary citizen getting one  it would also follow that said
person would get the ccw to carry on hisher person away from their home andor
business



would a prudent storekeeper carry concealed  how about someone at
home  note that both are legal and a lot of common people qualify
for one or the other

andy


maybe freeman did prove his point but his point is not relevant  the thing
that most people seem to care about when they ask questions about carrying
a concealed weapon is whether or not they can carry it concealed on their
person when they are out on the street somewhere  i am sure that not many
people are concerned with whether or not they can carry concealed at home
speaking as someone who lives in illinois the only place where the above
quoted law is relevant  i know that it is legal to own a handgun here i
am not taking into account city ordinances  i could care less about whether
or not i can carry concealed at home         i only care about the fact that
i cannot carry concealed in the place where it really counts out on the street
freeman loves to be accurate and i can understand that especially not but he
seems to be forgetting that accurate facts do not always replace common sense
i am not going to followup to this thread anymore because i believe that it is
useless to argue these points anymore  the only thing that is happening now
is that freeman and i are running around in circles trying to prove each
other wrong and i do not have the time to be playing games anymore  of course
now freeman will attack me about my use of common sense in some of my earlier
posts but what can i do  my only advice for freeman  quit being so picky
about accuracy sometimes and use your common sense it really does work some
times

if we posit two minds in christ the mind of the logos and the mind of the
human jesus then we must admit two wills  a mind is not a mind without a
will  i know this has been dealt with in past church prnouncements but there
is a philosophical problem here that should examined

t v morris argued that the incarnation can be seen like this

      		
     mind of logos
     	    
     		  	here the mind of jesus is circumsribed by god the
     	 human	  	son  god the son has complete access to the human
        mind	  	mind but the human mind only has access to the mind
     		  	of god the son when the son allows access  this 
     	  	explains why jesus said even he did not know the 
     	time of the kingdom	

the ideas of a completely healthy version of split personality from
the field of psychology and the intriguing ideas of being in a dream seeing
yourself acting knowing that is you but also being omniscient  


i have explained it here before  if you want the full document ask me by mail
rex 


   questions arise as we begin to think about logos and what his inner
consciousness was composed of we need to clarify the two natures of christ
briefly  the divine nature which has existed eternally did not undertake any
essential changes during the incarnation which would cause a conflict with the
attributes of god the foremost of these being his immutability  this would
mean that it remained impassable that is incapable of suffering and death
free from ignorance and insusceptible to weakness and temptation  in the realm
of the divine nature it is better to say that the son of god became that which
was not absoluteand in himself  the result of the incarnation was that the
divine logos could be ignorant and weak could be tempted and suffer and die
not in his divine nature but by the derivation of his possession of a human
nature
     this would mean that both the properties of the divine nature and the
human nature are properties of the person and therefore ascribed to the
person by this reason we can say that the person can be omnipotent
omniscient and omnipresent yet at the same time be also a man of limited
power knowledge a man of sorrows subject to human wants and miseries  there
is however no penetration of one nature into the other  deity can no more
share the imperfections of humanity than humanity can share in the essential
perfection of the godhead
     we are not to assume that there is a double personality due to the
possession of the double natures  christs human nature is impersonal in that
it attains selfconsciousness and selfdetermination in the personality of the
godman  we must now differentiate between the person and the nature of the
man nature is defined

the distinguishing qualities or properties of something the fundamental
character disposition or temperament of a living being innate and
unchangeable

     nature is then in essence the substance possessed in common in as such
the trinity have one nature  there is also a common nature of mankind 
personality on the other hand is the separate subsistence of nature with the
power of consciousness and will  it is for this reason that the human nature
of christ has not nor ever had a separate subsistence that it is impersonal
 logos the godman represents the principle of personality  it is equally
important to see that selfconsciousness and selfdetermination do not as
such belong to the nature  it is for this reason that we can justifiably say
that jesus did not have two consciousness or two wills but rather one  it is
theanthropic an activity of the one personality which unites in itself the
human and the divine natures being that neither the consciousness nor the will
are simply human or simply divine


the quotation given above is not identified and it is not entirely
clear to me what position loren is taking on it  just for clarity
let me note that the view expressed in it is one of the classic
christological heresies  monothelitism  that is the position that
christs two natures were not complete in that there was only one
will  in most cases which i think includes this example it was the
human will that was regarded as missing

normally people who talk about christs human nature as being
impersonal mean it in a somewhat more abstract sense  that is they
are using person as hypostatis not in the usual english sense of
personality  in this use the doctrine is called anhypostasia
personally i think anhypostasia is just a more sophisticated way of
denying that the logos took on humanity fully  however it has never
been formally ruled a heresy and in fact has been held by influential
theologians both ancient and modern eg athanasius  but the
quotation above appears to be going farther than even athanasius went
into the realm of the overtly heretical

can a theist be truly objective  can he be impartial
     when questioning the truth of his scriptures or
     will he assume the superstition of his parents
     when questioning 

i have often found it to be the case that the theist
     will stick to some kind of superstition when
     wondering about god and his scriptures  i have
     seen it in the christian the jew the muslim
     and the other theists alike  all assume that
     their mothers and fathers were right in the
     aspect that a god exists and with that belief
     search for their god
     
occasionally the theist may switch religions or
     aspects of the same religion but overall the
     majority keep to the belief that some creator
     was behind the universes existence  i have
     known muslims who were once christians and vice
     versa i have known christians who were once
     jewish and vice versa and i have even known
     christians who become hindu  yet throughout
     their transition from one faith to another
     they have kept this belief in some form of higher
     being  why
     
it usually all has to do with how the child is

     the torah the quran  etc  he is told
     of this wondrous god who wrote or inspired
     the scripture of the prophets talked about in
     the scripture of the miracles performed  etc
     he is also told that to question this as
     children are apt to do is a sin a crime
     against god and to lose belief in the scrip
     tures truth is to damn ones soul to hell
     thus by the time he is able to read the
     scripture for himself the belief in its truth
     is so ingrained in his mind it all seems a
     matter of course
     
but it does not stop there  once the child is able
     to read for himself there is an endeavor to
     inculcate the child the right readings of
     scripture to concentrate more on the pleasant
     readings to gloss over the worse ones and to
     explain away the unexplainable with mystery
     circular arguments selfevdent facts and
     truths unreasoning belief and fear of
     hell is the meat of religion the child must eat
     of every day  to doubt of course means wrath
     of some sort and the child must learn to put
     away his brain when the matter concerns god
     all of this has some considerable effect on the
     child so that when he becomes an adult the 
     superstitions he is been taught are nearly
     impossible to remove
     
all of this leads me to ask whether the theist can
     truly be objective when questioning god hell
     heaven the angels souls and all of the rest
     can he for a moment put aside this notion that
     god does exist and look at everything from
     a unbiased point of view  obviously most
     theists can somewhat especially when presented
     with mythical gods homeric roman egyptian
      etc  but can they put aside the assumption
     of gods existence and question it impartially

subject re hyslop and thetwobabylons
organization university of south africa
lines fiftytwo

in article  mangoecsumdedu charley wingate writes

seeing as how thetwobabylons has been brought up again it is time for
me to respond  once again and say that this book is junk  it is nothing
more that an anticatholic tract of the sort published ever since the there
were protestants  its scholarship is phony and its assertions spurious


i have not seen this book though i have had several people quote it in 
support of some tendentious assertions they were making so i have become 
curious about it

i do not want to malign this hislop fellow whoever he may be as i have only 
heard the arguments at second hand but both of the arguments seemed to turn 
on false etymology that seemed to be derived from hislop

i would be interested in knowing more about these things 

the first one claimed that the word church was derived from the greek 
cyclos and that it was therefore related to the worship of circe

i do not know if hislop is the source of this assertion but it does seem to 
be based on false etymology

the second claimed an etymological relationship between ishtar and 
easter which seemed to be even more fanciful and farfetched than some 
of the wilder notions of the british israelites

regarding the latter as far as i have been able to find out easter is 
derived from the old english name for april  eosturmonath the venerable 
bede mentioned that this was associated with a goddess called eostre but 
apart from that reference i have not been able to find out anything more 
about her it also seems that the term easter is only used by the english 
and those they evangelized the germans for example also use the term 
ostern but germany was evangelized by english missionaries

so i would be interested in any evidence of easter being used for pascha 
by people who do not have any kind of connection with the ancient anglo
saxons and their offshoots such evidence might support the claims of those 
who appear to derive the theory from hislop

the reason the fire department could not fight the fire is that bullets were
whizzing throughout the area  had koresh not had such a frightenly large
arsenal maybe the feds would not have decided that having the firedepartment
on the scene would have been a useless waste of taxes and potentially
dangerous had a different fire broken out in waco

so how come the fire department had been at the compound area for
fortynine days only to be sent away two days before the fbi attack

whatever the above comment has to do with the hazards of fighting a
fire in the midst of ammo cooking off
maybe the fire department was loudly complaining the whole time about
being diverted from their other duties and the fbi said fine go home

so far you have presented your opinions as opposed to mine i would
hardly take them as facts

because you do not agree with them hmm

no because a fact and an opinion are two different things what you are 
expressing here are opinions not facts

in the abstract what you are saying is true  but the facts happen to
agree with me and disagree completely with you  

i could give you hundreds of words in my mother tongue spanish that
are comonly use and you will never find in a dictionary even more i
could show you a lot of meanings that words in spanish have different
from those in the dictionary

we are talking about the latter not the former  and what you are talking
about is slang in the latter  that clearly has never been the case
here

no i am not talking about slang i am talking about different uses of the
same language in different places

listen pinkas  i am going to count on the supposition that you think
through the opinions you have  something which is by the way against
my better judgment based on what i have seen from you to date  we are
agreed are not we that dictionaries are reference books for the usage
of a given language and in particular for the meanings of the words and
phrases which comprise that language  now you are using meanings
completely different from indeed in some cases diametrically different
from those given in the dictionary  as a reference book a dictionary
contains those meanings in both past and as much as it can in current
use  that is also why they are updated so often  now if you are saying
things which you give different meanings than the dictionary does and
using nonstandard meanings about every word what is your chance of
being taken at face value

just about none  just about no one will take you that way because the
words mean something different to them  it is quite clear to me from
the response this thread has been getting that that is exactly what is
happening  ponder that


and guess why is not it curious that we do not know how many people define 
in how many different ways the term jew which is the basis of the movement 
itself

no probably because the question has not been asked  gee i hate it
when people draw conclusions without information do not you

i hate people who cannot read i did not draw any conclusion i just 
said that it is curious considering how heterogeneous the movement is

what you did was ask a leading question  in english idiom the phrase
and guess why in the way you used it is a loaded question with
only one answer expected  

i also take offense at being told i cannot read by someone who is
obviously having trouble with the subject himself  mr pinkas i am a
phd candidate in my field  one does not get to phd candidacy if one
cannot read  


the law of return and jewish nationality is defined in terms of religion and
not of cultural identity even if eighty of those defined as jews in isreal
are not religious

for the umpteenth time  it is not defined in terms of religion
this has been proven to you over and over again

no it has not the law of return defines a jew as someone who has a 
jewish mother and has not converted to another religion that is 
pretty the same as the religious definition



that is a problem i am saying that i do not support zionism as it is
now i believe that among the people in the soviet communist party some
might even had been inspired by noble ideals does that change the
final results of what happened in the ussr

are you now wishing to compare the ussr and israel  or what  israel
does not practice cruelty  

now i understand you are unable to make abstractions you cannot 
get the idea from a text and you take everything literally
bad thing

balderdash  you know this is false  i would be able to make the
abstraction if it bore any resemblance to the facts of the matter
yours did not  the analogy is utterly inapplicable

i would not be in the field i am in  astrophysics  if i could not make
abstractions and speculate about the general grand scheme of things  i
also would not be in education  which i am and my students give me
rather good reviews i would add  if i could not draw such analogies

about israel not practicing cruelty ask those palestinians in israeli
prisons those who were tortured those whose houses had been blown 
by the army

the vast majority of palestinians in israeli prisons are not tortured
and their houses were not blown up by the army  in fact you have seen me
protesting such measures on this net before  are you now trying to
intimate my agreement with them

i never said it directly nor indirectly i am not talking about individuals
who defined themselves as zionists here i am sure most of them are good
honest and caring people i am talking about the results of the zionist
movement

in other words you are taking that as a monolith and ignoring the
dissension within it disagreement that is expressed freely and is
widely based  just as bad

can you read or are you just typing at random 

do you know the meanings of the words you use or do you expect the
reader to read your mind  i can read just fine thank you  and i do not
need someone who is obviously having some troubles with a tongue which
is not his native one telling me how to read the words in my own native
tongue  if it were spanish i would ask you  

i am talking about a movement whose actions resulted in a
law of return with a religious definition of jew a country that defines
nationality based on religion

then you are not talking about the movement as it exists today as i have
been trying to tell you  please read the arguments i have given you  if
you can still say this after reading them you need to read them again





 i am talking about something i consider
a form of racism such as differenciation based on religious belief 
after all if arabs in israel cannot serve in the army is becasue they 
were not born in the right religion

arabs in israel not only can but do serve in the idf  as you well
know

they can serve it is true but they are not allowed to do the all the
same things as the israeli citizens who happen to be jews

yes they are  as you well know


ok fine  now we know what you are talking about  but do you see my
point about how your words could easily have been taken differently 

it is not we it was you as in the second person in singular who cannot
understand a text if things are not explicitly said

balderdash  see above  once again you have a lot of gall and
absolutely no right to lecture a native speaker of a language who is
well educated in it in a language which is not your own native tongue
and with which you are obviously having problems


so there is no difference between citizenship and nationality in israel
or what do you mean by actually it does not

i mean exactly that  arab and jewish citizens of israel have the same
rights

if there is no difference between them why keeping them in ids
better yet are you going to tell me that there are no differences in
social life between arabs and jews

social life is one thing legal status is another  once again this is
a leading question

so it follows a religious definition and not a cultural one that is what
i call a form of racism

no because the jewish religion and culture are intimately inseparably
intertwined  if one renounces judaism one renounces judaism  

i do not believe that this is true

final question  is it possible to be both jewish and muslim  jewish
and christian  your response will be enlightening

 according to jerry manders in the absence of the sacred good
 book by the way the great binding law of the iroquois confederacy
 also played a significant role as a model for the yous constitution
 furthermore apparently marx and engels were strongly influenced
 by a study of iroquois society using it as the prime example of
 a successful classless egalitarian noncoercive society  mander
 goes on to say that both the yous and the youssr would do well
 to study the original document figure out where each went wrong
 and try to get it right next time

that is fascinating   i heard that the chinese rather than
the italians invented pasta

that is fascinating  i take it that you are expressing skepticism
at the idea that those ignorant savages could have influenced
the constitution of the people who stole their continent  you
could be right but it sounds plausible to me  is there any
reason that you dismiss it outofhand  here is some more

   recent scholarship has shown that in the midone thousand seven hundreds indians were not
   only invited to participate in the deliberations of our founding
   fathers but that the great binding law of the iroquois confederacy
   arguably became the single most important model for the one thousand seven hundred and fiftyfour albany
   plan of union and later the articles of confederation and the
   constitution  that this would be absent from our school texts
   and from history and from media is not surprising given the devotion
   americans feel to our founding myth great men gathered to express
   a new vision that has withstood the test of time  if it were
   revealed that indians had a role in it imagine the blow to the
   american psyche
   
      by one thousand seven hundred and fiftyfour when most of these men and others gathered to creat the
   albany plan of union the first try at confederation they invited
   fortytwo members of the iroquois grand council to serve as advisors
   on confederate structures  benjamin franklin freely acknowledged
   his interest in the iroquois achievement in a famous speech at
   albany congress it would be a strange thingif six nations
   of ignorant savagessic should be capable of forming such a union
   and be able to execute it in such a manner that it has subsisted
   for ages and appears indissoluble and yet that a like union should
   be impractical for ten or a dozen english colonies
      according to grinde franklin convened meetings of iroquois chiefs
   and congressional delegates in order to hammer out a plan that he
   acknowedged to be similar to the iroquois confederacy

grinde is professor donald grindejr of the university of california
at riverside whose book the iroquois and the founding fathers of the
american nation addresses this issue

 mounting holes had to be drilled
 
 i recognize it is more fun to discuss why chris needed to change brands of
 penis enhancer but how bout some comments on single fire ignitions for
 a while

i just installed a mc power arc ii and it seems to run great i also
used mc coils and neither the ignition module or the coils required
any new mounting holes to be drilled on my ninetytwo fxstc a little soldering
and all was fine static timing was real easy to set too 

on the other side of the coin my local wrench whose opinion i
invariably seek but do not always adopt thinks mc power arc is a piece
of shit and says all them jap chips are going to fail you one day 
needless to say he does not like any electronic ignition modules and
recommends the dynas system i think that is the one with the
halleffect timing sensors correct

 on the other hand i can easily see them recording the traffic for
 interesting people such as dissidents suspected criminals
 foreign telephone calls and anybody noticed using encryption
 as ken shiriff speculates recording encrypted traffic will probably
 be judged not to be an invasion of privacy pretty soon 

as i read the current wiretap law it would not be legal now  on the
other hand assuming a legislative change recording but not decrypting
clipper conversations would probably be found constitutional by the supreme
court using the same reasoning or the lack thereof by which they
permit random roadblocks to check for drunk drivers

incidentally if we use that as our model the court will likely not
uphold selective recording  on the other hand i do not think they have
thrown out drug courier profiles yet  must be that exception to
the fourth amendment that i can never find in my copy of the bill of
rights

a lot  and i mean a lot  will depend on exactly how clippertaps
or tipperclaps for encrypted music are used  don alvarez showed in
the latest risks digest that it is possible to prevent the cops from
reading traffic after their warrant expires

that is  the cops send the lef to the fholder  the fholder strips
off f and sends youkn to the escrow agents  they send either you or k
to the cops  don says you i say k  the cops cannot use you in the
future because they cannot strip off f  the fholder never sees you  in
dons model the escrow agents cannot read the traffic because they
do not have k in my model they have k but not the message itself
and i trust that more because i think the cops and the fbi the
fholder are more likely to collaborate on breaking the rules  the
net result is that by involving the fholder and the escrow agents on
every tap we can avoid extending permission to tap

weve had the the great western the  do not know  and the great northern
postulated as brunels masterpiece keep boxing the compass chaps youll
get round to it eventually

the great western was a highly successful transatlantic mail ship
with hybrid sail and steam propulsion the great eastern which broke
the little giant financially and otherwise was a revolutionary leap
forward in ship design a thirty thousand ton all steel vessel with
primary steam propulsion it was at the time easily the biggest ocean
going vessel ever built brunel took advantage of the fact that cargo
and  or fuel capacity rose with the cube of scale while drag rose
with the square so a really big ship could steam thousands of miles
without coaling

unfortunately there was no real market for such a beast at the time
and it was eventually sold off at scrap values as another poster
said it then went on to a successful career as a telegraph cable
laying ship it was in fact the only ship of its day capable of laying
a transatlantic cable in one go with the endurance and capacity to
carry the huge reel all the way and the manoeuverabilty to dredge for
defective sections see arthur c clarkes book how the world was one
 i think thats right 

if thats how the shuttle goes down in history as a technical triumph
and a financial disaster for the builder it would not be entirely
ignoble but i doubt if history will be so charitable  its true the
shuttle can do things no other launch system can do but are they
worth doing with low cost access to space you could have an
affordable space station for doing shuttlelike extended manned
missions as it is the shuttle is not so much a spacetruck as a
spacerv  only not so cheap to run

we just received an appleone color scanner for our lab  however
i am having trouble getting reasonable scanned output when printing 
a scanned photo on a laserwriter iig i have tried scanning at a 
higher resolution and the display on the screen appears very nice  
however the printed version is coming out ugly  

is this due to the resolution capabilities of the printer  or are 
there tricks involved to get better quality   or should we be 
getting something like photoshop to pretty up the image
i will appreciate any suggestions

thanks in advance

from the batf itself

koresh and his followers did not capture the compound a few years ago it

with the murder when the sheriff came to arrest him the sheriff knocked

subject yankee thoughts
organization clam associates cambridge ma two thousand one hundred and fortyone
lines seventysix


yes  everyone seems to be in agreement that the yankees are 
finally moving in the right direction  they should finish
over five hundred this year and maybe even be in the pennent race 
in august  however i would take back a few moves

one  the jim abbott trade
    i think abbott is not only an inspirational person but a
    great pitcher also  he could win the cy young this year 
    but he will not because the right side of the yanks infield
    is not good enough  so why was this not a good trade  
    jt snow  how many rookies have been able to step in and
    immediately have the impact that he has had so far on 
    the angels  i know it is early but if you have seen this kid
    hit field or talk you can just tell that he is going to be 
    a tremendous player  the yanks should have kept him  what
    about mattingly you ask  well  it is great that the yanks
    have taken care of him and remained loyal but he is ten years
    older than snow and just does not have the same bat speed as
    before his back injury  it is a shame but as a yankee fan 
    who wants to see the best yankee team i would take 
    snow over mattingly at first  the yanks also gave up two
    promising propects with snow for abbott  besides with
    domingo jean brien taylor wickman militello and sterling
    hitchcock they are just loaded with propects  i know abbotts
    only twentysix but this was too much to give up  i believe george
    forced this trade because he believes and he is right that
    abbott will be a big hit in ny  however i would like to see the
    yankees build a baseball team not an amusement show

two  wade boggs
    i live in boston and like wade a lot  but his career is 
    winding down and i would rather see the yanks start to develop
    a long term solution ie hensley muelins russ davis velarde
    besides wade just does not have any range  what a shame about
    charlie hayes huh

three  spike owen
    see wade boggs  i would much rather see them develop dave silvestri
    or whoever  wade and spike next to each other in the infield is
    going to raise the yankee staff era onetwo point  and these guys
    are on the down sides of their careers

four  danny tartabull
    yes  he is put up some tremendous numbers and it is nice to think
    about what he could do if he were ever healthy all year  but he
    never is  we should expect one hundred and twenty games max out of him  meanwhile
    gerald williams is playing at columbus and paul oneil is playing
    left field  i believe oneil led nl outfielders in assists
    last year  and tartabull is a poor defensive outfielder

what i am basically getting at is the yanks are moving in the right
direction but are not ready to win a pennent this year  they should
at the gm level be planning for a one thousand nine hundred and ninetyfour or one thousand nine hundred and ninetyfive world series  this
means getting the younger players experience in the majors now so they 
will be ready in a year or two  

i am afraid that all this stuff wreaks of george steinbrenner
certainly the boggs deal was all george  it looks like george is
planning the right mix of veterans and young players to win a world
series now  the veterans are always available and can be added at any
time like boston did this year  develop the young players first
then add the one or two veterans or in the yankees case just keep
them  let us all us yankee fans hope that george does not dismantle
the terrific job stick and company have done building the yankee
organization back into one of respect  i am really afraid that he will
trade whoever it takes to patch holes today relief pitching for
example  george must realize that the yankees rebuilding process is
still one or two years away  have patience george and we will all
enjoy the future  fire bucky and trade the kids and it is baseball
hell for all loyal yankee fans for a long time

if you can open the file with a text editor and find

new three hundred series mercedes benz wagon
particularly i would like to hear about power manual t only
any comparisons between the saab nine thousand line and the mercedes would be helpful

if a manual transmission is a must have then the mb three hundredte is not in
the running  you cannot get a manual transmission in that car in north
america  it seems that buyers here or maybe more accurately the
distributors are not interested in manual trannies

the ninetythree three hundred line comes with a two hundred and seventeen hp engine  all earlier years are one hundred and seventyseven hp
i have an eightyseven three hundrede with a mere one hundred and seventyseven hp and auto tranny and i find that
it has sufficient power for any normal driving situation  more is always
nice but i cannot complain

i test drove a saab nine hundred cse last fall  here are my impressions

one awesome power especially over three thousand five hundredrpm when the turbo really comes on
two if you get on the power really hard in a tight corner the frontwheel
   drive causes it to understeer heavily and then viciously hook into
   the corner  not a desirable handling trait but common in powerful
   front drive cars  the cse is two hundredhp  mercedes is reardrive so it
   does not have this problem
three huge interior and cargo space
four the most rubbery shifter i have ever encountered  i drove a fivespd  it
   was absolutely numb  you might be able to get used to it  i do not know
   i also did not like its location which was too far down and too far right
   from the shifters position i got the impression that saab really designed
   the car for an automatic
five it was rather noisy  engine buzz rattles and creaks  mercedes does
   not exhibit these characteristics

you should also check out the new bmw five hundred and twentyfive touring  this is a wagon version
of the five hundred and twentyfivei  it fits into the class with the three hundredte and saabs

    a bright light phenomenon was observed in the eastern finland
    on april twentyone at zerotwentyfive ut two people saw a bright luminous
    pillarshaped phenomenon in the low eastern horizont near
    mikkeli the head of the pillar was circular the lower part
    was a little winding it was like a monster they told they
    were little frightened soon the yellowish pillar became
    enlarged a bright spot like the sun was appeared in the middle
    of the phenomenon at last the light landed behind the nearby
    forest now there was only luminous trails in the sky which were
    visible till morning sunrise

    the same phenomenon was observed also by jaakko kokkonen in
    lappeenranta at zerotwentysix ut he saw a luminous yellowish trail in
    the low northeastern horizont the altitude of the trail was
    only about threefour degrees soon the trail began to grow taller
    a loop was appeared in the head of the trail it was like a
    spoon this lasted only ten seconds now the altitude was about
    five degress above horizont he noted a bright spot at the
    upper stage of loop the spot was at magnitude two the loop
    became enlarged and the spot was now visible in the middle of
    the loop a cartwheelshaped trail was appeared round the bright
    spot after a minute the spot disappeared and only fuzzy trails
    were only visible in the low horizont luminous trails were still
    visible at onefortyfive ut in the morning sky

    the phenomenon was caused by a russian rocket i do not know if
    there were satellite launches in plesetsk cosmodrome near
    arkhangelsk but this may be a rocket experiment too since one thousand nine hundred and sixtynine
    we have observed over eighty rocket phenomena in finland most of
    these are rocket experiments military missile tests barium

 on fournineteenninetythree  fournine john bongiovanni had the unmitigated gall to say this

 suddenly the date no longer rolls over  the time is reasonably accurate
 allways but we have to change the date by hand every morning  this involves
 exiting the menu system to get to dos
 
 jb did i once hear that in order for the date to advance something like
 jb a  clock has to make a get date system call apparently the clock
 jb hardware interrupt and bios do not do this date advance
 jb automatically the get date call notices that a midnight reset flag
 jb has been set and then then advances the date

when a program uses a dos call to get the system it resets the flag that
tells the bios that it has passed midnight  it then uses this flag to
increment the date  if the menu does a call to the system to get the time
before midnight before the bios sees the midnight flag then bios will not
know that the day passed and the date will not get updated

i might have some doss and bioss mixed up darned cold messed up my
brains but this has been a well documented problem for years  i do not know
of a workaround  hope this helps

ok if you have read this group for a while you know all about the
onetimepad but here is a question i have not seen

the onetimepad yeilds ideal security but has a wellknown flaw in
authentication  suppose you use a random bit stream as the pad and
exclusiveor as the encryption operation  if an adversary knows the 
plaintext of a message he can change it into any other message  
here is how it works

alice is sending bob a plaintext p under a key stream s
alice computes the ciphertext c  s xor p  and sends it to bob

eve knows the plainext p but wants the message to appear as p
eve intercepts c and computes  c  c xor p xor p  s xor p
eve sends c to bob

bob decrypts c by computing  cxor s  p  thus receiving the 
false message which was substituted by eve


now the question is how can this attack be defeated with information
theoretic security not just computational security
can we define something like ideal authentication which is the
analog of ideal security  can we obtain ideal authentication 

if not how much can we limit eves control over the message 

if we can achieve ideal authentication does the solution use more
key bits or expand the message   can we show the solution to be
optimal in one or more parameters 

does anyone know if these questions have been aswered before

how many times did the cock crow

mar fourteenseventytwo  and the second time the cock crew and peter called to mind  the 
word  that  jesus  said unto him before the cock crow twice thou shalt deny
me thrice and when he thought thereon he wept

mat twentysixseventyfour  then began he to curse and to swear  saying  i  know not the man
and immediately the cock crew
mat twentysixseventyfive  and peter remembered the word  of  jesus  which  said unto him
before the cock crow thou shalt deny me thrice and he went out and wept
bitterly

while he yet spake the cock crew
luk twentytwosixtyone  and the lord turned and looked upon peter and  peter remembered
the word of the lord how he had said unto him before the cock crow thou
shalt deny me thrice

joh thirteenthirtyeight  jesus answered him wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake 
verily
 verily i say unto thee the cock shall not crow still thou hast denied me
thrice

joh eighteentwentyseven  peter then denied  again  and  immediately  the  cock crew

destruction of cities what said was jeremiah was zechariah

this is interesting because matthew quotes a prophesy that was never made 
not the only time he does this either

mat twentysevennine  then was fulfilled that which was spoken by jeremy  the prophet 
saying  and they took the thirty pieces of silver the price of him that was
valued whom they of the children of israel did value

wine with myrrh  mark fifteentwentythree

women at the cross

matthew said many stood far off including mary magdaline mary the mother of
james and the mother of zebedees children  mark and luke speak of many far
off and mark includes mary magdeline and mary the mother of james the less
john says that jesuss mother stood at the cross along with her sister and
mary magdalene

jesus last words 

matttwentysevenfortysixfifty and about the ninth hour jesus cried with a loud voice 
saying eli eli lama sabachthani that is to say my god my god why
hast thou forsaken me  jesus when he cried again with a loud voice
yielded you the ghost

luketwentythreefortysix and when jesus had cried with a loud voice he said father unto
 thy hands i commend my spirit and having said thus he gave up the ghost

johnnineteenthirty when jesus therefore had received the vinegar he said it is 
finished and he bowed his head and gave up the ghost

events of the crucifiction

matthew says that the veil of the temple was rent that there was an
earthquake and that it was dark from the sixth to the ninth hour that graves
opened and bodies of the saints arose and went into jeruselem appearing to
many beating jesus to the resurection mark and luke speak of darkness and
the veil of the temple being rent but mention no earthquake or risen saints 
john is the only one who mentions jesuss side being peirced

burial of jesus

matthew says the jews asked pilate for a guard to prevent the body from being
stolen by the disciples and for the tomb to be sealed all of this was
supposedly done but the other gospels do not mention these precautions

how long was jesus in the tomb
depends where you look matthew twelveforty gives jesus prophesying that he will
spend three days and three nights in the heart of the earth and mark tenthirtyfour
has after three days meta treis emeras he will rise again as far as i can
see from a quick look the prophecies have after three days but the
postresurrection narratives have on the third day

time of the resurection

matthew says sunday at dawn mark says the sun was rising and john says it
was dark

 who was at the empty tomb  is it 

mat twentyeightone  in the end of the sabbath as it began to  dawn  toward the first
day of the week came mary magdalene and the other mary to see the sepulchre

mar sixteenone  and when the sabbath was past mary magdalene and mary the  mother 
of  james and salome had bought sweet spices that they might come and
anoint him

joh twentyone  the first day of the week cometh mary magdalene  early when  it 
was  yet  dark unto the sepulchre and seeth the stone taken away from the
sepulchre

whom did they see at the tomb

mat twentyeighttwo  and behold there was  a  great  earthquake  for  the angel of the
lord descended from heaven and came and rolled back the stone from the door
and sat upon it
mat twentyeightthree  his countenance was like  lightning  and  his  raiment white as
snow mat twentyeightfour  and for fear of him the keepers did shake  and  became as
dead men mat twentyeightfive  and the angel answered and said unto  the  women  fear
not ye for i know that ye seek jesus which was crucified

mar sixteenfive  and entering into the sepulchre they saw a  young  man sitting  on 
the right side clothed in a long white garment and they were affrighted

luk twentyfourfour  and it came  to  pass  as  they  were  much  perplexed thereabout
behold two men stood by them in shining garments

joh twentytwelve  and seeth two angels in white sitting the one at  the head  and 
the  other  at  the feet where the body of jesus had lain

belief that the disciples stole jesuss body

matthew says the guard was paid to tell this story but no other gospel makes
this claim

appearences of the risen jesus

matthew says an angel at the tomb told the two marys and that jesus also told
them to tell the disciples to meet him in galilee  the disciples then went
to a mountain previously agreed opon and met jesus there  this was his only
appearance except to the women at the tomb  matthew only devotes five verses
to the visit with the disciples

mark says that jesus walked with two of the disciples in the country and that
they told the rest of the disciples who refused to believe  later he
appeared to the eleven disciples at mealtime

luke says two followers went the same day that jesus rose from the dead to
emmaus a village eight miles from jeruselem and there jesus jioned them but
was unrecognised  while they ate a meal together that evening they finally
recognised jesus whereopon he dissapeared  returning at once to jeruselem
they told the
disciples of their experience and suddenly jesus appeared among them
frightening them as they thought he was a spirit  jesus then ate some fish
and honey and then preached to them

john says jesus appeared to the disciples the evening of the day he arrose in
jeruselem where they were hiding  he breathed the holy ghost opon them but
thomas was not present and refused to believe eight days later jesus joined
the disciples again at the same place and this time he convinced thomas	once
more jesus made an
appearance to the disciples at the sea of tiberias but again was not
recognised
 after telling them to cast their netson the other side of the boat jesus
becomes known to them and prepares bread and fish for them  they all eat
together and converse

the book of acts further adds to the confusion  it says that jesus showed
himself to the apostles for a period of forty days after his resurection thus
contradicting matthew mark luke and john and spoke to them of things
pertaining to the kingdom of god and when he had spoken these things while
they beheld he was taken up and a cloud recieved him out of their sight 
and while they looked steadfastly toward heaven as he went up two men stood
by them in white apparel which also said ye men of galilee why stand ye
gazing into heaven this same jesus which is taken from you into heaven
shall so comein like manneras ye have seen him go into heaven acts onethreeeleven

paul outdoes every other authority by saying that jesus was seen by five hundred
persons between the time of the resurection and the
assension although he does not say where	he also claims that he himself as
one born out of due time also saw jesus one cor fifteensixeight

the ascension

matthew says nothing about it	mark casually says that jesus was recieved into
heaven after he was finished talking with the
disciples in jeruselem  luke says jesus led the desciples to bethany and that
while he blessed them he was parted from them and carried up into heaven 
john says nothing about it  acts
contradicts all of the above  see previous section

when second coming

mat twentyfourthirtyfour  verily i say unto you this generation shall not pass till all
these things be fulfilled

mar thirteenthirty  verily i say unto you that this generation shall  not pass till
all these things be done

luk twentyonethirtytwo  verily i say unto you this generation shall not  pass away till
all be fulfilled

one thessalonians fourfifteeneighteen

where jesus had appointed them

 ascend to heaven

	no man hath ascended up to heaven but he that came down from heaven 	
the son of man john threethirteen

as you can see there are a number of contradictions in the account of the
trial crucifiction and resurection of jesus  if these are good witnesses
you would think that they could get some of these important details right 
in fact i cannot find very many points on where they agree  you would think
that they could at least agree on some of the points they were supposedly
observing because of the fact that there is so much contradiction and error
the story of the resurection as presented cannot be taken as literal truth
due to the nature of the story i doubt if it should be taken as any sort of
truth

the source and nt meaning
of arsenokoitai with implications
for christian ethics and ministry

                                      james b deyoung

w petersen

     more recently wrights understanding has itself been questioned from a
different direction  in a brief one thousand nine hundred and eightysix study william petersen found linguistic
confusion in using the english word homosexuals as the meaning of
arsenokoitaitwentytwo   he faulted wright and english bible translaions for
rendering it by homosexuals in i cor sixnine and i tim oneten

     in a sense petersen has coalesced bailey boswell and scroggs into a
single assertion that reiterates in effect the position of bailey  he finds
homosexuals unacceptable as a translation because it is anachronistic  a
major disjunction exists between contemporary thought and terminology and the
thought and terminolgy in pauls time one hundred and eightyseveneightyeight

      what is this disjunction  he bases it on historical and linguistic
facts  accordingly ancient greek and roman society treated male sexuality as
polyvalent and characterized a person sexually only by his sexual acts 
virtually all forms of behavior except transvestism were acceptable 
christianity simply added the categories of natural and unnatural in
describing these actions  ancient society know nothing of the categories of
homosexuals and heterosexuals and assumed that in the words of dover
quoted approvingly by petersen everyone responds at different times to both
homosexual and to heterosexual stimuli   one hundred and eightyeight twentythree

      in contrast to this modern usage virtually limits the term homosexual
to desire and propensity  km benkert who in one thousand eight hundred and sixtynine coined the german term
equivalent to homosexual used it as referring to orientation impluse or
affectional preference and having nothing to do with sexual acts one hundred and eightynine

     petersen then proceeds to cite the supplement to the oxford english
dictionary  which defines homosexual only as a propensity or desire with no
mention of acts  petersens point is that by using homosexuals for
arsenokoitai one wrongfully reads a modern concept back into early history
where no equivalent concept existed one hundred and eightynine  consequently the translation is
inaccurate because it includes celibate homophiles    incorrectly exludes
heterosexuals who engage in homosexual acts    andincorrectly includes
female homosexuals nineteeneightynine  prior to one thousand eight hundred and sixtynine there was no cognitive structure
either inour society or in antiquity within which the modern bifurcation of
humanity into homosexuals and hetersosexuals made sence one hundred and eightynine

     the foregoing clarifies why petersen feels that the translatio
homosexual is mistaken  yet is it possible that petersen is the one
mistaken on both historical and linguistic or philological grounds  the next
phases of this paper will critically examine petersens position

                        the justification for translating
                          arsenokoitai by homosexuals

historical grounds

     a refutation of the foregoing opposition to the traslation of arsenokoitai
by homosexuals begins with the historical and cultural evidence  since
virtually everyone acknowledges that the word does not appear before pauls
usage no historical settings earlier than his are available  yet much writing
reveals that ancient understanding of homosexuality prior to and contemporary
with paul  the goal is to discover wheither the ancient s conceived of
homosexuality particularly homosexual orientation in a way similar to
presentday concepts  

     peterson bailey boswell and scroggs claim that the homosexual
condition desire propensity or inversion whatever it is called cannot be
part of the definition of the term  they assert this either because the term
is limited to acts of particular kind boswell active male prostitutes 
scroggs pederasty or because the homosexual condition was unknown in ancient
times bailey petersen  the following discussion will show why neither of
these positions is legitimate  attention will be devoted to the latter postion
first with the former one being addressed below under linguistic grounds

     in regard to the latter position one may rightfully ask did not the
homosexual condition exist before one thousand eight hundred and sixtynine  is it only a modern phenomenon yet if
it is universal as alleged today it must have existed always including
ancient times even though there is lack of sophistication in discussing it 
indeed evidence show that the ancients prechristian and christian not only
knew about the total spectrum of sexual behavior including all forms of
samesex activity transvestism included but also knoew about samesex
orientation or condition  petersen admits one hundred and ninety n ten that plato in
symposium one hundred and eightyninedone hundred and ninetytwod may be a sole possible exception to ancient
ingnorance of this condition  he discounts this however believing that even
here acts appear to be the deciding factor  however this is a very
significant exception hardly worthy of being called an exception because of
the following additional evidence for a homosexual condition

     the symposium of plato gives some of the strongest evidence for
knowledge about the homosexual condition twentyfour   plato posits a third sex
comprised of a mailefemale androgynon manwoman hence original nature
palai physis consisted of three kinds of human beings  zeus sliced these
human beings in half to weaken them so that they would not be a threat to the
gods  consequently each person seeks his or her other half either one of the
opposite sex or one of the same sex  plato then quotes aristophances

    each of us then is but a tally of a man since every one shows like
    a flatfish the traces of having been sliced in two  and each is ever
    searching for the tally that will fit him  all the men who are sections
    of that composite sex that at first was called manwoman are 
    womancourters  our adulterers are mostly descended from that sex
    whence likewise are derived our mancourting women and adulteresses
    all the women who are sections of the woman have no great fancy for men
    they are incllined rather to women and of this stock are the sheminions
    men who are sections of the male pursue the masculine and so long as 
    their boyhood lasts they show themselves to be sliced of the male by
    making griends with men and delighting to lie with them and to be
    clasped in mens embrasces  these are the finest boys and striplings
    for they have the most manly nature  some say they are shameless
    creatures but falsely  for their behavior is due not to shamelessness
    but to daring manliness and virility since they are quick to welcome
    their like  sure evidence of this is the fact that on reaching maturity
    these alone prove in a public career to be men  so when they come
    to mans estate they are boylovers and have no natural interest in
    wiving and getting children but only do these things under stress of
    custom  they are quite contented to live together unwedded all their days
    a man of this sort is at any rate born to be a lover of boys or the 
    willing mate of a man eagerly greeting his own kind  well when
    one of them whether he be a boylover or a lover of any other sort 
    happens on his own particular half the two of them are wondrously 
    thrilled with affection and intimacy and love and are hardly to be 
    induced to leave each others side for a single moment  these are
    they who continue together throughout life though they could not
    even say what they would have of one another one hundred and ninetyonedone hundred and ninetytwoc twentyfive

should these two persons be offered the opportunity to be fused together for as
long as they live or even in hades aristophanes says that each would
unreservedly deem that he had been offered just what he was yearning for all
the time  one hundred and ninetytwoe

     several observations about this text are in order  lesbianism is
contemplated as will as male homosexuality one hundred and ninetyonee  natural interest ton
noun physei one hundred and ninetytwob refelects modern concepts of propensity or inclination 
the words born to be a lover of boys or the willing mate of a man 
paiderastes te kai philerastes gignetai one hundred and ninetytwob reflect the modern claims to
be born this ie as homosexual  the idea of mutuallity the two of them
are wondrously thrilled with affection and intimacy and love one hundred and ninetytwob is
present  aristophanes even speaks of mutual love ingrained in mankind
reassembling our early estate ho eros emphytos allelon tois anthropois kai
tes archaias physeos synagogeus one hundred and ninetyoned the concept of permanency these are
they who continue together throughout life one hundred and twoc is also present  further
mention of andor allusion to permanecy mutality gay pride pederasty
homophobia motive desire passion and the nature of love and its works is
recognizable

    clearly the ancients thought of love homosexual or other apart from
actions  the speakers in the symposium argue that motive in homosexuality is
crucial  money office influence etc   bring reproach one hundred and eightytwoeone hundred and eightythreea one hundred and eightyfourb 
they mention the need to love the soul not the body one hundred and eightythreee  there are tow
kinds of love in the body one hundred and eightysixb and each has its desire and passion
one hundred and eightysixbd  the speakers discuss the principles or matters of love one hundred and eightysevenc the
desires of love one hundred and ninetytwoc and being males by nature one hundred and ninetythreec  noteworthy is the
speech of socrates who devotes much attention to explaining how desire is
related to love and its objects two hundredatwo hundred and onec  desire is felt for what is not
provided or present for something they have not or are not or lack  this is
the object of desire and love  socrates clearly distinguishes between what
sort of being is love and the works of love two hundred and onee  this ancient
philosopher could think of both realms seaual acts as well as disposition of
being or nature  his wors have significance for more than pederasty twentysix

     in summary virtually every element in the modern discussion of love and
homosexuality is anticipated in the symposium of plato  petersen is in error
when he claims that the ancients could only think of homosexual acts not
inclination or orientation  widespread evidence to the contray supports the
latter twentyseven

     biblical support for homosexuality inclination in the contexts where
homosexual acts are discribed adds to the case for the ancient distinction  in
rom onetwentyonetwentyeight such phrases as reasoning heart becoming foolish desires
of the heart and reprobate mind prove pauls concern for disposition and
inclination along with the doing or working of evil also see vv twentyninethirtytwo 
even the catologues of vices are introdiced i tim oneeightten or concluded i cor
sixnineeleven by words describing what people are or were not what they do 
habits betray what people are within as also the lord jesus taught cf matt
twentythreetwentyeight  the inner condition is as important as the outer act one gives rise
to the other cf mt fivetwentyseven

     petersen errs regarding other particulars too  transvestism apparently
was accepted by the ancients   it was practiced among canaaniteds syrian
people of asia minor as well as greeks according to sr driver twentyeight  only a
few moralist and jewish writers are on record as condemning it  for example
seneca moral epistles fortysevenseveneight condemns homosexual exploitation that forces an
adult slave to dress be beardless and behave as a woman  philo also goes to
some length to describe the homosexuals of his day and their dressing as women
the special laws iii thirtysevenfortyone  see also his on the virtues twentytwentyone where he
justifies prohibition of crossdressing  even the ot forbade the interchange
of clothing between the sexes  deut twentytwofive

     petersen is also wrong in attributing to christianity the creating of the
new labels of natural and unnatural for sexual behavior  these did not
begin with paul rom onetwentysixtwentyseven but go as far back as ancient greece and even
nonchristian contemporaries used them  plato the testnaph philo josephu
plutarch and others used these words or related concepts twentynine

 one last point darryl sutter is getting badly out coached by bob berry  the
 madder darryl gets the more he reminds me of brian  the hawks are
 quickly loosing thier focus i do not think the blues will win in four but you
 never know

not to sutter bash or anything since i idolized them as players
you sure would think the sutters would learn something about burning out their
teams in the regular seasonjust too much intensity during the regular 
season  i earlier posted a note about brian and got to thinking after i read
this itemgee both sutters won their divisions and now both have lost 
home ice advantage and are getting smoked in their opening series in the
playoffs  kind of makes you wonder

bottom lineman it is great to be smoking the warthawks
agreed jimthis has been damn sweet so far  about the only thing
that comes close to this is shutting up all the maple laugh fansdetroit
has completely kicked their asses so far  but i will stick with the
blues for providing the best playoff tonic so far

i am in need of all of the players wearing seventyseven in the nhl  i know now only
of one ray borque for the bruins  any help would be greatly appreciated

i believe that phil esposito was the first to wear seventyseven when he played
with the rangers in the seventys  this was the season that they put the
rangers crest and modernstyle numbers on the jerseys instead of the
new york or rangers block letters and twocolour numbers  he took seventyseven
because the rangers already had a seven

hockey night in canada made a big thing out of it saying it was the

 if the haitian peoples will is that their current govt get thrown out 
 they will find a way to do it getting the usun to shortcut the process will 
 only hasten it but sets a bad precedent  can the us interfere everywhere 
 why not right at our doorstep  cuba
 
 precisely why not cuba  why not  the hatians are being ruled by thugs 
 and their elected leader has asked support to reestablish the peoples will  

well let us delve one level deeper why is democracy better than tribalism or
other means of govt the president of georgia was elected with a thumping
majority and booted out later w no objections from the un similarly the
people of algeria elected an islamic fundemantalist party into power but the
junta declared it illegal in both cases i personally have no problems with
the outcome but if the voice of the people is that hallowed thing that the 
world community claims to revere so why is not it interfering there 

 the yous or any other democracy wishes to they are in the perfect right to 
 help them without any whining from thir parties  after all if it turns out to 
 be colonialism and the poeple do not like it they find a way to throw them out

exactly my point is that it will inevitably turn out that way and we can save
ourselves a lot of pain and trouble by simply letting people sort out their
problems on their own colonial interventions even in haiti have not worked 
in the past they had a one hundred and two coups from one thousand eight hundred and fortyfiveone thousand nine hundred and fifteen the us invaded in one thousand nine hundred and fifteen and left
in one thousand nine hundred and thirtythree almost seventeen years after they had intended to was it a success well
look at haiti today and of the past forty years and decide for yourself it was
a success so long as the us was in from what i remember but it did not last
long obviously

 there is an implicit assumption here that we as outsiders have a right to sit
 in judgement of another people and to then act on it to me it is in there
 that the roots of old colonial attitudes lie today the motives are noble
 tomorrow they may not be
 
 who ever said people who commit genocide have the right to commit genocide 

nobody did people should have a right to selfdefense if the un wants to arm
the bosnians or haitian revolutionaries or whoever i have no problems with
that i do when they cross that line and attempt to rearrange boundaries govts
etc the vanceowen plan being one such piece of insanity
 
 i want a world where criminals agains humanity have no place to hide while you 
 want special sovereignties designed to protect them  nobody has the right to 
 commit crimes against humanity and if they do they loose all right to self 
 determination  if this is classical colonialism then so be it

we finally have a clearlystated point of difference colonialism can
have its good side which is as you stated above  removing thugs from being
able to lord it over powerless people i am worried that the bad side is what 
will assert itself and i am prepared to let natural forces take their course 
if that will mean we can avoid the bad side of colonialism

for best performance do not use smartdrive to cache the

check it out for yourself

i think it is important to clear up your first reply  you gave the
impression that you should not use smartdrive with stacker   you are
correct re caching the compressed drive  however as i understand it
you can cache the uncompressed drive  thus if you have compressed your

i just bought a little gizmo that is supposed to be installed in

those suppose i am holding a regular phone wire such that the little
plastic tooth on the little plastic square thing with the naked lead
ends that you plug into the phone is facing down and away from me
which of the four wires that i see is the tip and which is the ring
please reply to mlevinhusceightharvardedu

mike levin

mike ring is the red wire tip is the green wire of most standard
phone lines they two constitute the two wires most often used for
voice telephone the two live lines they are the two innermost
connectors of an rjeleven phone jack

another way of telling is that if you measure voltage from red to
green ring to tip tipgreen being at ground potential of the
voltmeter it should read fortyeight volts in the onhook noring position
i am ninetyeight sure it is fortyeight v and not fortyeight volts does not hurt a phone too
much if they are reversed it is just bad if one happens to somehow get
grounded to earth ground elsewhere

additionally when offhook the voltage drops to about four to nine volts
dc i think it is supposed to correspond to a thirtysix to forty ma current
loop and lastly when ringing the two wires develop an ac potential
of about eighty v pp at twenty to thirty hz across them where you get the
electromechanical old fashioned bell ringer from

 on many lists in many computers the irs social security admistration and

 maintaining yet another list of people is an utter waste of money and time
 let us axe this whole department and reduce the deficit a little bit

	more gridlock talk from another relic of the past  the
selective service system creates jobs and is an investment in 
the future of americaand what is wrong with that

  do we want to create jobs or do we want jobs created that are productive
  in our supplydemand economy if your answer is the former then we can
  just round up all jobless people and pay them to build sandcastles in
  the desert if you answer the latter then i fail to see how another
  bureaucracy produces anything

	we need jobs because at this point in the recovery the economy
should have generated ten billion jobs and since it has not the
government has to step in and help  shutting down selective service
would cost good jobs and we cannot do that  

	what we really need is to involve selective service in a more
closely directed manner  we need the selective service involved
in environmental protection highspeed rail commuter aircraft 
civil rights national service and health care  every dollar
we put into selective service now will get us ten less spending
in future

	i really believe now to think about it that selective service
is longpast due for the creation of a cabinet position


	your not beyond hope just get back on americas side and
start doing your part for change  what bill needs from you
now is support for the economic stimulus and health care reform
you need to devote all your energies to fighting gridlock and
supporting change  get on the team  after all the evil has
been banished from washington and the time for complaint 
is past being neccessary

okay the earth has a magnetic field unless someone missed something

okay if you put a object in the earth magnetic field it produces electricty

no if you put a conductor in a changing magnetic field it produces a voltage
the two ways you can do that with a permanent magnet is to move the magnet or
move the conductor  the slow shifting of the earths magnetic field is not
really significant especially when you consider how weak the earths magnetic
field is to begin with

now the question can you use electricity to power a spacelow earth orbit
vehicle and i fyou can can you use the magnetic field of the earth to power
it

well it would require generating an incredibly large magnetic field to repel
the earths magnetic field as a magnet can repel another magnet  of course
this force only works in one direction and the magnetic field generated has
to be unimaginably powerful  magnetic repulsion drops off as onerthree and the
earths magnetic field on the surface is already very weak  it would require
some sort of unknown superconductor and special nonmagnetic construction
and seriously hardenned electronics optical computers perhaps  and the
physiological danger would be significant due to the iron content in our
blood among other things  in other words forget it

can the idea of a dragless satellite be used in part to create the electrical
field

after all the dragless satellite is i might be wrong a suspended between to
pilons the the pilons compensate for drag i think i know what i want to say
just not sure how to say it

a dragless satellite sounds interestingly enough liek a generator

i missed out on the dragless satellite thread but it sounds totally bogus

basically what i mean is design a mother ship that has piggy backed probes for
different missionsnamely different planets each probe would be tied in with
the mother ship or earth as the case may be this is good when and if we go
for mars the mars mission can act as either mother ship or relay point for the
probes

also the mother ship would be powered if not the mars mission by a normal
propulsion but also a solar sail main reason for solar sail race is to see
what can be done and autmoated the sail would get the probes to were they
needed i know the asteroidmeteor clouds and such might get in the way of a 
sail

main reasonf ro mother ship idea is to make it more economoical to send

scottcsuiucedu jay scott writes
a rep at the dealer actually it is a university order center so
they do not have any immediate financial interest told me that
they have been having lots of problems with their centris six hundred and ten
he did not go into details but mentioned problems with the
floppy drive and intermittent problems with printing files
it sounded to me like they were having both hardware problems
and software compatibility problems with the machine
he is not recommending the centris six hundred and ten to anybody he says to
consider a centris six hundred and fifty or a iivx why he would recommend a
iivx over an lciii i do not know but that is what he said
so what does the net think did the dealer just get one flaky
machine or did apple send the csix hundred and ten out the door too early
is your csix hundred and ten working just great or is it buggy too

my six hundred and ten is working great  i have not heard of any problems  sounds
to me like your dealer does not know what he is talking about  it is
pretty irresponsible to not reccomend the centris six hundred and ten on the basis
of problems with one machine  recommending the iivx over the lciii
does not make a lot of sense either  if this person is so convinced the six hundred and ten
is buggy have they talked to apple about it or are they just assuming
it is a problem with all of them

nunnallyacshardingedu john nunnally writes
 when are we going to hear a christian answer to this question 
 in paraphrase 
 on what or whose authority do christians proclaim that they
 are above the law and above the prophets seven major and twelve minor and not 
 accountable to the ten commandments of which jesus clearly spoke his opinion 
 in matthew fivefourteennineteen what is the source of this pseudodoctrine who is
 the pseudoteacher who is the great deceiver
ok here is at least one christians answer
jesus was a jew not a christian  in this context matthew fivefourteennineteen makes
sense  matt fiveseventeen do not think that i jesus came to abolish the law or
the prophets i did not come to abolish but to fulfill  jesus lived
under the jewish law  however he was the culmination of the promises
of the prophets  he came to fulfill the prophecies and fully obey
gods purposes
verse eighteen says for truly i say to you until heaven and earth pass
away not the smallest letter or stroke shall pass away from the law
until all is accomplished  the key to this verse imho is the last 
phrase  jesus as the fulfillment of the law accomplished what the 
law was supposed to accomplish  

jesus did not say that he was the fulfillment of the law and unless
i am mistaken heaven and earth have not yet passed away am i mistaken
and even assuming that one can just gloss over that portion of the word
of jesus do you really think that all is accomplished

verse nineteen  whoever then annuls one of the least of these commandments
and so teaches others shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven
but whoever keeps and teaches them he shall be called great in the
kingdom of heaven  taken in the context of jesus teaching jewish 
people about living lives under the law this makes sense

then why did not jesus say any jew who annuls  in v nineteen are you
saying that all of jesus recorded words mean nothing to gentiles are
you really saying that jesus only spoke for and to the jews jesus
did not mention your name does that mean he was not speaking to you when
you read the words of jesus do you think he is speaking to someone
other than you

in general it appears that jesus is responding to some criticism he 
must have received about doing away with the law  that was not 
jesus intent at all

you said above that jesus was the fulfillment of the law are you
saying that does not mean doing away with the law

he had come to earth to live the law as it 
should be lived and fulfill the promises made by god to his 
people all the way back to eve gen threefifteenthe serpent will bruise your 
heel but he will bruise his head

genthreefifteenjps i will put enmity between you and the woman and between
your offspring and hers they shall strike at your head and you shall
strike at their heel

genthreefifteennrsv i will put enmity between you and the woman and between your
offspring and hers he will strike your head and you will strike his
heel

genthreefifteenkjv and i will put enmity between thee and the woman and
between thy seed and her seed it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt
bruise his heel

looks like your translation has taken a few liberties with the word

jesus appeared to be doing away with the law 
because he did not honor the traditions of men as 
equal to the law of god  he regularly locked horns with the religious 
leaders of the day because he would not conform to their rules only 
gods law
in the matthew passage jesus is defending his dedication to the law 
and defending himself against his accusors  almost the entire sermon 
on the mount matt fiveseven is dedicated to helping the jewish people 
understand the true intent of the law sweeping away the clutter which 
had been introduced by the pharasees and their traditions

only helping the jewish people

in galatians threetwentythreetwentysix paul describes the relationship of jesus to the 
law in this way
twentythree but before faith came we were kept in custody under the law being 
shut up to the faith which was later to be revealed  twentyfour therefore 
the law has become our tutor to lead us to christ that we may be 
justified by faith  twentyfive  but now that faith has come we are no 
longer under a tutor  twentysix for you are all sons of god through faith 
in christ jesus
i believe this says that after christ was revealed the law had 
served it is purpose ie our tutor to lead us to christ and
now we are no longer under a tutor  the law has been fulfilled 
as christ said he would do

you are using your interpretation of paul as an argument against the
clear words of jesus

god the author of the old law and the christman jesus are the same
personality  therefore the old law and the new testament the last
will and testament of jesus are based on the same moral principles 
it makes sense that many of the principles in the old law are
reexpressed in christianity 

reexpressed care to define that a bit better

on the other hand now that the law has fulfilled it is purpose and 

what are heaven and earth gone away where did they go is all
accomplished for example revelations explain please

christians relate to god through christ not the law it also makes 
sense that new practices and new symbolisms were established to 
represent the mysteries of this new relationship  ie baptism 
representing christs death burial and resurrection rom sixthreeeight
the lords supper as a memorial to his sacrifice i cor eleventwentysix and
sunday as a day of worship commemorating his resurrection matt twentyeightoneff
acts twentyseven

again your interpretation of paul versus the clear word of jesus do
you see any problems here when did heaven and earth go away when was
all accomplished

ok that is one christians explanation  i do not claim to have all
these issues completely settled even in my own mind and i welcome
other christians to offer other alternatives
please excuse the long posting  thanks for your interest if you have read 
this far

      i believe with everything in my heart that on may three one thousand nine hundred and ninetythree the city of
 portland oregon in the country of the united states of america will be hit
 with a catastrophic and disastrous earthquake
 by now we know that this did not come to pass

surprise surprise i sure did not lose any sleep over it and i live there

mistakes in this area are costly and dangerous  for me my greatest fears
in this area would be the following
fourwere god to call me to be a prophet and i were to misrepresent gods word
   my calling would be lost forever  gods word would command the people
   never to listen to or fear my words as i would be a false prophet  my
   bridges would be burnt forever  perhaps i could repent and be saved but
   i could never again be a prophet of god

suppose someone said that he was sure that he would return from death
in glory and power flying in the clouds with the host of heavensoon within
the lifetimes of those then standing with him  and two thousand years went by without
any such event he also asserted so they say himself to be god

two questions

	one is that one of those false prophecies you were talking about
	two does that make the speaker a false prophet

speak directly  if the lord has given you something to say say it
but before i declare thus sayeth the lord i would better know for certain
without a shadow of a doubt that i am in the correct spiritual condition
and relationship with the lord to receive such a prophecy and be absolutely
certain again without the tiniest shadow of a doubt that there is no
possibility of my being misled by my own imaginations or by my hope of gaining
recognition or of being misled by the wiles of the devil and his followers

uhh  has it occurred to you that there is no way to know any of these
things for certain without the tiniest shadow of a doubt that people
who thought they did have also been deluded

those of us who believe in actually being able to check our opinions
have an out  we can check against some external reality those who
assert that beliefs entertained without evidence or even despite evidence
have a special virtue ie faith are out of luck  and this is the
result

it is time that we christians give an example of honesty that stands out in
contrast against this backdrop of falsehood  when we say thus sayeth the
lord it happens  when we pray prayer is answered because we prayed right
when we say we are christians we really mean it

           dan

you want to demonstrate christian honesty great
start with the prophecy above  what can we conclude about the speaker

 the prozac gave very bad anxietyjitters and insomina it was impossible to 
 sit still for more than a minute or so

i tried prozac a few months ago and had some insomnia from it but no
anxiety or jitters  i probably could have lived with the insomnia if the
prozac had done any good but it only provided a tiny benefit  maybe
because the person who prescribed it did not know much and gave up after a
twentymg dose did not work

now i am seeing a psychiatrist who has put me on zoloft another serotonin
reuptake inhibitor like prozac  one pillday fiftymg seemed to help some 
now i am trying one hundredmgday  zoloft has fewer and milder side effects than
prozac  i think my doctor said that only four of the people taking zoloft
have to discontinue it because of side effects  the only problem i am
having is some minor gi distress but nothing too annoying  hopefully the
zoloft will work  maybe your friend should try this one next

my psychiatrists strategy seems to be to first try one of the serotonin
drugs usually prozac  if that works great  if it works but has too many
side effects try zoloft or maybe paxil  if the serotonin drugs do not work
at all try one of the tricyclics like desipramine

suggestions as to the next step

having a doctor who knows something about antidepressants can make a big
difference  my psychiatrist claims that most gps and fps do not have much
experience in this area and from what i have seen i am inclined to believe
him  i think i know more about antidepressants than the people at my
family practitioners office

disclaimer i am not a doctor what i know about this comes from talking to

much bs deleted for brevity

again my point was that not all microsofties are here to sell 
readers on our products which would conflict with the noads 
philosophy of usenet  nor do we necessarily have access to info
that others have

it certainly smacks of that remember the poll that you quoted 
saying that you had seen a ninetyfive of users being satisfied with dos sixzero 

it was ninetythreeninetyfour and actually another msdos team member posted it
note that people not on the msdos team would not necessarily know
about that or

care to recall how unbiased the sample set was 

when i heard those numbers i wondered how they got them having
worked in product support and knowing that the typical support caller
has very little positive to say about the product i figured it was not
from there so i wandered over to the marketing folks and asked
and i was told it was from a survey of registered users  and i 
posted that on the net when people asked where the ninetythree figure came 
from

that post sure looked like fudand coming from a microsoftie 
 well it sure seemed like something was not on level

hmm i figured if chuck posted the numbers why not include where
they came from i also find it interesting that postitive info is 
fear uncertainty  doubt

advocacy is good  but spreading fud to advocate your favorite os is very 
unethical  especially when you have a vested interest in the success 
of that os

  i think you have got me confused with someone else i do not 
pretend that msdos provides what all people need or that other
oses including unix  ostwo do not provide useful andor necessary
features  i also do not push people to use msdos i even posted in
composmsdosmisc that i suggest waiting before installing a 
new os esp if you have trouble support is always overloaded 
during release unless the sales are a total bomb

i also get tired of people assuming that microsofties are like
members of the borg

that is because their actions seem to invite this opinion  never seen more 
defensive people in my life 

i are not saying some of us do not get defensive sometimes do you really
think msdos gets any more respect within microsoft than outside it

i just mean we all are not cut out of the same dough with the same cookie
cutter we do not all think alike  yeah chuckst and i have some inside
info on msdos  does not mean that everyone else does   

seriously speaking it is a shame that ms techie employees get the heat for
mss actions  most of which are perpetrated by the management and marketing
i am sure that they are very talented etc  i have not doubts about their 
abilities just about the ethics of their marketing practices

i have seen people in their forties and fifties become disoriented and
demented during hospital stays in the examples i have seen drugs were
definitely involved 
 
my own father turned into a vegetable for a short time while in the
hospital he was fiftythree at the time and he was on twentyone separate
drugs

no wonder he became confused  with so many drugs it is almost impossible
to know which one is causing the problem  and because some drugs 
potentiate the effect of each other they can make the side effects
all the worse and even dangerous  kind of like mixing alcohol and 
antihistamines

he was disoriened the doctors thougt  they should put him on something
else as well

unfortunately doctors prescribe drugs to treat the side effects of
the drugs a patient is receiving  if one drug they are taking causes
the patients blood pressure to go up many times an antihypertensive
is prescribed instead of reevaluating the need for the original drug
this is why many older adults are trying to take a dozen or so drugs
at home

procure a list of the drugs your grandmother is getting and discuss
it with an independent doc her problems may not be the effect of haldol
at all haldol may have been used validly or it may have been
prescribed because other medication confused her and because the
hospital normally prescribes haldol for the confused elderly

i fully agree  in addition she proably should be examined by another
doctor who can reevaluate the need for the medications she is taking
i cannot remember the guidelines i either saw in a text or heard during
a lecture but any elderly adult who is receiving medications should have
the need for the drug reevaluated regularly  if her current physician
is unwilling to do this find one who will  either check the phone 
book for a physician who specializes in geriatric medicine or gerontology 
or contact a physician referral line or the american medical society
by finding a geriatric specialist he she will more likely be in tune
with the special needs of elderly adults and maybe can help

are in a different class  the big question seems to be is it reasonable to 
use them in patients with gi distress or sinus problems that could be due 
to candida blooms following the use of broadspectrum antibiotics

i guess i am still not clear on what the term candida bloom means
but certainly it is well known that thrush superficial candidal
infections on mucous membranes can occur after antibiotic use
this has nothing to do with systemic yeast syndrome the quack
diagnosis that has been being discussed


found in the sinus mucus membranes than is candida  women have been known 
for a very long time to suffer from candida blooms in the vagina and a 
women is lucky to find a physician who is willing to treat the because and 
not give give her advise to use the otc antifungal creams

lucky how  since a recent article randomized controlled trial of
oral yogurt on reducing vaginal candidiasis i have mentioned to a 
number of patients with frequent vaginal yeast infections that they
could try eating six ounces of yogurt daily  it turns out most would
rather just use antifungal creams when they get yeast infections

yogurt dangerous  if this were a standard part of medical practice as 
gordon r says it is then the incidence of gi distress and vaginal yeast 
infections should decline

again this just is not what the systemic yeast syndrome is about and
has nothing to do with the quack therapies that were being discussed
there is some evidence that attempts to reinoculate the gi tract with
bacteria after antibiotic therapy do not seem to be very helpful in
reducing diarrhea but i do not think anyone would view this as a
quack therapy

ddaviscassmatwobullcom dave davis

the deuterocanonical books were added much later in the churchs
history  they do not have the same spiritual quality as the
rest of scripture  i do not believe the church that added these
books was guided by the spirit in so doing  and that is where
this sort of discussion ultimately ends

the apocryphal books that are in the septuagint were part of the canon 
used by the greekspeaking churches from the inception of the church
they were not added later or much later  this is a common misconception

the preference of the hebrew canon over the greek canon is a later
innovation   the church did not need to be guided to add the books
since they were part of the faith once received by the apostles and
passed to the church

 hi
 
 i have been having an argument about the origins of the bible lately with
 a theist acquaintance  he stated that thousands of bibles were discovered
 at a certain point in time which were syllableperfect  this therefore
 meant that there must have been one copy at a certain time the time quoted
 by my acquaintace was approximately fifty years after the death of jesus

you can tell your friend from me that i was in a publishers
warehouse one time and saw thousands of copies of the joy of
cooking and every one of them was syllableperfect

i have since sold all i own and become a follower of the joy
of cooking  the incident i mentioned convinced me once and
for all that the joy of cooking is inspired by god and the
one true path to his glory

   one remove the balk rule  it is the runners responsibility to stay safe
      no matter what the pitcher does

quite honestly this one is ridiculous  consider the following
scenario runner on third as the pitcher starts to throw home the
runner takes off for home and the batter squares around to bunt for
the suicide squeeze the pitcher seeing this does not throw home
but stops in mid action and puts the runner in a run down  it is the
balk rule that prevents this from happening  

believe it or not this actually happened to me once in an oba

"from brianlplarizonaedu brian ceccarelli six hundred and twosix hundred and twentyonenine thousand six hundred and fifteen
subject re is it good that jesus died
organization lunar  planetary laboratory tucson az
lines one hundred and twenty

brian ceccarelli wrote that is me

 kent i am not accusing you of evil things  jesus is accusing you
 and it is not only you that he is accusing  he is accusing everyone
 me you and everyone in the world is guilty  whether one
 sees the light or does not seen the light has nothing to do with 
 whether we do evil things  we do them regardless  

kent sandvik responds

 hmm it seems that this is the core of christianity then you 
 have to feel guilty    

i think i see where you are coming from kent  jesus does not view
guilt like our modern venacular colors it   

feelings have nothing to do with guilt  feelings arise from the state of 
being guilty  feeling and guilt are mutally exclusive  feelings are a 
reaction from guilt  jesus is talking about the guilt state not the 
reaction   let me give you an example

have you ever made a mistake  have you ever lied to someone  even a
little white lie   have you ever claimed to know something that you really 
did not know  have you ever hated someone  have you ever been selfish
are you guilty of any one of these   the answer is of course yes  you
are guilty  period  that is it what jesus is getting at  no big surprise  
feelings do not even enter the picture   consider jesuss use of the word
guilt as how a court uses it

jesus is concerned that everyone should admit that they are guilty of being
imperfect  the bible calls it the state that we are all sinners  we all do
bad things  even the most insignficant thing that we do wrong is proof of our 
guilt that we are all sinners     it is it in our nature to do bad things 
we are sinners therefore we do bad things  being a sinner is fact  it is
not a pleasant fact  but it is just a fact  we are not perfect   calling us
sinners should have no more emotional charge to you than calling you a
human being  guilty as charged

 and then there is this single personality that will save you from this
 universal guilt feeling

you can handle your guilt in one of two ways  acknowledge you
made a mistake learn from it and try to not do it againin
the meantime not punishing yourself for it  which is the
way jesus wants you to handle or it  this is the healthy way

or two the destructive way  put yourself down slap yourself
and feel like crap never forgive yourself force yourself to
say a thousand hail marys    even to suicide  this the way 
jesus does not want us to deal with it   all people fall into this 
category to some extent in their lives

jesus is not in the business of saving us from this guilt
feeling  jesus is in the business of showing us how much he
loves us despite our guilt  jesus knows we are guilty  that
is not new to him  it is no big deal to him he just wants you to realize 
that this sinful nature destroys the relationship between you and him
that is what he wants you to know  why because he wants to 
have your company  you are immensely valuable to him
jesus wants a relationship with you however in our present
sinful nature we are incapable of having this relationship  

god is perfect  we are not  you cannot fit a square peg into
a round hole  however god has provided a way for us to
change our nature so that we can have a relationship with him
god has provided jesus so that whosoever just believes in
jesus will have their nature changed  the holy spirit will
move it  and now divine nature is now within lives our very
beingand us and god communicate with each through his
unifying holy spirit  the benefits of this are endless  for
with the divine nature living within us we can now see
our imperfections better  we can now head them off at the pass  with
the power of the holy spirit living in us we now have his power
to help us overcome our shortcomings   because the divine nature lives 
within us we can now understand profound bible passages that never before
we could understand  because the divine nature now lives within us we now 
have authority over demonic forces  and lastly because the divine 
nature now lives within us we have eternal lifefor the holy spirit
is eternal

the relationship with jesus is of the utmost importance  because
it is not what you do in life that qualifies you to belong to
heavenly kingdom it is your relationship to the living god
remember what jesus said at the tail end of matthew when he
separated the goats from the sheep   many people in the
last day will ask him did not i prophesy in your name and do
miracles and do good things in your name   and what did jesus say
depart from me for i never knew you  that is the cornerstone of 
christianity kent  jesus must know you as his friend  it is your 
relationship to jesus  if he is your friend and you are his you will
be counted among those who will share in his inheritance in heaven  

 brian i will tell you a secret i do not feel guilty at all
 i do mistakes and i regret them however i have never had this
 huge guilt feeling hanging over my shoulder

good  it shows that you have a strong selfimagethat you
love yourself  that is the second greatest commandment jesus
taught  if only more people could do as you do   as i said before 
in the common english venacular feeling guilty has a
different meaning than the state of guilt

 this all is a very clear indication that you need a certain
 personality type in order to believe and adjust to certain
 religious doctrines and if your personality type is 
 opposite then you are not that easily attached to a certain
 world view system

i believe what we all need in our personalities is a lot less ego
a lot less selfcenteredness and a lot more unconditional love

 there are humans that subscribe to the same notion the nice
 thing is that when you finally shake off this huge burden
 the shoulders feel far more relaxed

yes  you have stated what jesus said  remember  come to me
take my yoke upon your shoulders for my burden is light  a yoke
is used to direct oxen to do work  once you have a relationship with 
jesus you and him share the yoke and the burdens of life  having 
god at your side is of great advantage

organization dixie communications public access  the mouth of the south
lines fiftythree

bressleriftccucaboeingcom rick bressler writes

small arms rounds set off outside of a firearm pose little risk except
possibly eye injuries and minor wounds  

true

large concentrations of ammo
or magazines not the type you insert into your semi auto probably
pose a larger risk but mostly from heat and flame  this is also
covered in the above reference

no more risk than smaller stashes unless the stash is somehow confined so
the heat from early ignitions could somehow bulkheat the remainder

two  years ago this month my house and office burned  in my office was my
reloading bench  on the top shelf next to the wooden ceiling was 
about one hundred lbs of smokeless powder five lbs of black powder several thousand
primers and a couple thousand loaded rounds primarily in fortyfiveacp thirtytwenty
and three hundred and eight  the fire was extinguished before the area containing the 
reloading supplies were fully involved  there was about onetwo of char on
the joists subsequently removed by sandblasting  lots of heat in other
words

none of the powder kegs ignited  one onelb can of pistol powder ignited
no explosion as the can opened at the seam as it was designed to do
the black powder cans were charred and got so hot the plastic lids
completely melted and ran down inside  the smokless powder was
contained mostly in eight lb cardboard or metal kegs  the kegs were charred
badly enough that the paper labels burned completely off and in the case
of the metal cans the plastic lids melted completely away

many of the rounds cooked off  they were in close proximity to wood
on all sides so the effects were easy to observe  in most cases with the
rifle ammo the cartridge cases ruptured in the middle  many bullets were
found still in the neck  small shards of brass were lightly stuck into 
the wood  lightly enough that brushing them with a fingertip would usually
dislodge them  primers generally popped out of the primer pockets
the fortyfiveacp rounds that cooked off left empty cases and bullets laying around
no dents were observed above the storage area indicating the bullets
left the cases slowly enough not to be a hazard

ordinary small arms ammo is not a hazard when cooking off regardless
of what the fbi says

it is probably possible to build a singlebank eight mb simm using four mb parts

he reminds me of chris chelios sometimes  speaking of chelios i 
wonder if serge savard feels like a moron for making that trade

vincent damphousse has decided to take a vacation apparently  i have
no idea why demers is playing denis savard on the checking line with
carbonneau  savard is skating well and is one of the only dangerous
canadiens in quebecs zone with the puck  too bad nobody is in front
most of the time

do you also notice that in the defensive zone not a single nordique
gets knocked down  it is disgusting  we also have lebeau fiveten one hundred and seventytwo
getting pasted at centre ice by wolaninn sixthree two hundred and five with no reply
from the team except to yell for a penalty  dammit denis savard 
threw the best only montreal hit of the night when he knocked
sundin offbalance  when denis savard is your teams enforcer there is
big trouble someplace

hextall made some good saves but
really this one was lost in first period when nords scored three
 could have had five plus another four in twond

aside from that second goal roy did stand on his head  the third 
period at least provided something to look forward to  habs won the
period i am going to and i guess somebody finally came along to smack them a
couple of times in the second intermission to remind them that a game
had started at seventhirty  hopefully they play that way at home  roy made 
the saves we will ignore that second goal so now it is up to the team

picture our universe floating like a log
in a river  as the log floats down the
river it occasionally strikes rocks the
bank the bottom other logs  when this collission
occurs kinetic energy is translated into heat the
log degrades gets scraped up and other energy 
translaions occur  the distribution of damage to
the log depends on the shape of the log

however to a very small virus in a mite on the head of a
termite in the center of the log the shock waves from the
collissions would appear uniformly random in direction

this is my theory for grb  they are evidence of our universe
interacting with other universes  why not  makes
just as much sense as the grb coming from the oort cloud

the log theory of universes cannot be ruled out

of course i am a layman in the physics world  you

   just add to phils very infomative discussion the following caveat the
   fifth amendment applies only in crinial cases  nor shall any person 
     be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself

    maybe you are using the wrong amendment  if someone were to seize
a safe containing your paper records and demand that you produce
the combination the applicable defense would be on grounds of
unreasonable search and seizure  the police would be entitled to
subpoena documents relating to a specific matter but any broad search
such as implied by impounding all your records would be unconstitutional
in the case of the safe they would probably get a locksmith and
assert that they only examined documents covered by the warrent
sure  in the cryptographic case their only resort would be
rubberhose cryptography

    this would also make a good mental experiment to use in
choosing escrow agents  would you trust this proposed agent with a

i replied to this query via email but i think there are some
issues that are worth discussing in public

mta mtabbottunixamherstedu wrote
 i am doing research on atheism part of which involves field research here
 on the net  the following is a survey directed towards all readers of this
 group intended to get data about the basis of atheistic belief

i would recommend you to take a look at

one your dictionary
two altatheism faq files

to notice that atheism is not a belief system and what is common
to all atheists is not a belief but a lack of belief in deities
i cannot imagine how anyone could do research on atheism without
paying careful attention to this issue 

 first of all i have tried to structure questions that can be answered in a
 variety of ways with varying amounts of detail it is possible to give 
 succinct answers to most everything but there is enough here to keep most of 
 you typing for hours i am sure

imho this is a poor method to do any real survey although i am sure the
replies might keep you amused for hours

 also i tend to use a lot of anthropological buzzwords like belief system
 although i know some of you might contend that you do not have any beliefs
  but
 are skeptical towards everything  i understand but you know what i mean
 think of such buzzwords as abbreviations for the rather unweildy phrases 
 required to get the precise idea across  

no i do not know what you mean if you are surveying our individual
philosophies fine but that is not strictly atheism atheism is not
just another godless version of the theistic explanations for life
the universe and everything it is not a belief system and it could
hardly be called a philosophical system

once more atheism is characterised by lack of belief in deities 
do not twist the meaning or assume that we have some kind of
philosophy we all agree on

some comments on your questions

 what contact with other atheists have you had before and after and during
 your conversion to atheism  certainly your involvement with altatheism
 counts  how have net discussions affected your beliefs  

i would also like to hear more about this have we been able to convert
anyone

 are you convinced that your beliefs were acquired through wholly rational
 means proofs of the nonexistence of god etc or was it perhaps at least 
 in part through other means alienation from mainstream religion etc  

this question contains a contradiction in terms beliefs 
cannot be acquired rationally  if they could they would not be 
beliefs you also seem to have rather strange ideas of how people become
atheists  those who are alienated from religion do not necessarily
become atheists they just think very little about religion it seems
it requires a considerable time of honest inquiry to find out that
religions are actually intellectually dishonest virtual realities

those who have never had beliefs will certainly find this question
quite odd  how can lack of belief be acquired when did i acquire
lack of belief in the easter bunny i did believe in santa though 

 to what extent do you feel you understand the universe through your 
 beliefs what phenomena of the universe and of human existence anything
 from physical phenomena to the problem of the existence of evil in human
 affairs do you feel are adequately dealt with by your beliefs and where
 are they lacking as an explanatory method  

this question does not make any sense since atheism does not deal with
these issues  it is not a worldview or a philosophy or a belief system

sigh why have not i seen a good wellthought survey in the usenet
for three years and what is the point of doing surveys in the net
anyway just to abstract some opinions

summary creationist nonsense
organization tektronix inc beaverton  or
lines seventyeight

john e king kingctroncom posts a whopping one liner

  the modern theory of evolution is so inadequate that it deserves to be 
   treated as a matter of faith  francis hitching                     

  i have a few points to make about the above posting

    one science is not based on and does not consist of quotes from either
    real or alleged experts  critical reasoning evidence and if possible
    experimentation are necessary  creationists frequently display a massive
    confusion about this by merely quoting both nonexperts and experts alike
    some of the latter quotes are in fact false and steadfastly refusing to
    follow any kind of rigorous scientific procedure  this strongly suggests
    that a their claims completely lack any scientific merit and b they
    are aware of this fatal deficiency  of course you may not actually be a
    creationist and this may not be your real intent

    two you have failed to identify hitching and the surrounding context of his
    statement  why is that  if hitching is a scientific illiterate then the
    quote would merely display his profound ignorance of evolutionary biology
    creationists are frequently known to quote real scientists out of context
    and to fabricate statements that they subsequently attribute to legitimate
    scientists  of course you may not actually be a creationist and this may
    not be your real intent

    three evidence supporting the alleged inadequacies of the modern theory of
    evolution would be a much more powerful argument than a contextless one
    line quote from an unidentified nobody  it is also important to note that
    disproving biological evolution does not automatically prove some alternate
    claims any more that disproving that the earth is shaped like a hockey puck
    proves that it is a hyperbolic paraboloid  creationists seem rather fond
    of diving head first into this logical fallacy  of course you may not
    actually be a creationist and this may not be your real intent

    four since evolution is central to virtually all of modern science an attack
    on evolution either the fact or the theory really represents an attack on
    science  while the theory will unquestionably continue to evolve b the
    fact of evolution will not ever go away  creationists lost the battle long
    ago more than one hundred years in fact but are simply too willfully ignorant and
    irrational to acknowledge the fact  of course you may not actually be a
    creationist and you may not really be that ignorant


warren kurt vonroeschlaub kvseveniastateedu asks

  neither i nor websters has ever heard of francis hitchings  who is he 

  i like hitchings am not to be found in websters b  francis hitchings
is a scientifically illiterate creationist or perhaps he is just playing the
part of one who wrote a quite ignorant book attacking evolution the neck of
the giraffe  in that publication he quotes a creationist jean sloat morton
using the standard invalid creationist probability argument that proteins could
not have formed by chance  thus not only confusing abiogenesis with evolution
the two are quite independent but also concluding with a non sequitur ie
the conclusion does not follow pp seventyseventyone  hitchings also misquotes richard
lewontin in an effort to support creationism pp eightyfour

  hitchings book was reviewed by national park service ecologist david graber
in the los angeles times and repeated in the oregonian  the article was
titled giraffe sticks scientific neck out too far  excerpts include 

  francis hitchings is not a biologist  he goes after darwin like mark
  antony after brutus  he flips from scientific reasoning to mysticism and
  pseudoscience with the sinuosity of a snakeoil salesman  he suggests
  a mystical organizing principle of life using the similarity of organs
  in different creatures as evidence sic

  note that the last statement above is actually evidence for evolution not
against it  if john e king is quoting from this reviewed book it would not
surprise me much  it is also interesting that king had nothing to add ie
he only posted a quote

corpses litter hills in karabakh

anatol lieven comes under fire while flying with azerbaijani forces 
to investigate the mass killings of refugees by armenian troops

as we swooped low over the snowcovered hills of nagornokarabagh we saw 
the scattered corpses apparently the refugees had been shot down as 
they ran an azerbaijani film of the places we flew over shown to 
journalists afterwards showed dozens of corpses lying in various parts 
of the hills

the azerbaijanis claim that as many as one thousand have died in a mass killing 
of azerbaijanis fleeing from the town of khodjaly seized by armenians 
last week a further fourzero are believed to be wounded frozen to death 
or missing 

seven of us squatted in the cabin of an azerbaijani mtwentyfour attack helicopter 
as we flew to investigate the claims of the mass killings suddenly there 
was a thump against the underside of the aircraft a red flash of tracer 
ripped past the starboard wing and the helicopter rocked sharply we 
swung round and there was a deafening burst of fire from the cannon 
under our wing as the helicopter crew returned fire

we had been fired on from an armenian antiaircraft post we swung round 
again tipped to starboard and appeared to dive straight down into a 
valley the brown earth swooped around our heads the helicopter swung 
round again and followed the contours of the ground our cannon fired 
repeated blasts

later it emerged that a civilian helicopter that we had been escorting 
had landed successfully at nakhichevanik in the east of the disputed 
enclave of nagornokarabakh to pick up some of the dead we had in 
fact been attacked both by ground fire and by an armenian helicopter 
i had seen the armenian helicopter intermittently through the window 
its cannons firing but had thought  mistakenly  that it was on 
our side our group of western journalists had embarked on a 
searchandrescue flight that had become a combat mission

our flight consisted of the civilian passenger helicopter and two 
mtwentyfour soviet attack helicopters in the azerbaijani service nicknamed 
flying crocodiles for their armour our party was in the second 
crocodile the civilian helicopters job was to land in the mountains 
and pick up bodies at sites of the mass killings the attack helicopters 
were there to give covering fire if necessary

the operation showed a striking sign of the disintegration of the soviet 
armed forces because our pilot was a russian officer an azerbaijani 
official told us that there were now five former soviet military 
helicopters and their pilots fighting for azerbaijan they have 
signed contracts to fly for us he said the helicopter we engaged 
in combat was most probably flown by a brotherofficer of our russian 
pilot but fighting for the armenians

we had taken off just before fivepm on saturday from agdam airfield an 
heated for the armeniancontrolled mountains of karabakh a sheer 
white wall in the distance the civilian helicopter picked up four 
corpses and it was during this and a previous mission that an 
azerbaijani cameraman filmed the several the several dozen bodies 
on the hillsides we then took off again in a hurry and speed back 
towards azerbaijani lines azerbaijani gunners on the last hill before 
the plain  and safety  gazed up at us as we passed

back at the airfield in agdam we took a look the bodies the 
civilian helicopter had picked up two old men a small girl were 
covered with blood their limbs contorted by the cold and rigor 
mortis they had been shot

what did our russian pilot think of the tragedy our close shave 
and the war in nagornokarabakh he gave us cheerful grin politely 
declined to answer ques tions and marched off to his dinner

                            might serve as ways of escape for the turks

onetwentyfive pm edt


	     the president  good afternoon  please be seated  i 
want to say first how delighted i am to be here with secretary 
riley and with senator graham  the three of us served as governors 
together during the one thousand nine hundred and eightys when we worked constantly on strategies to 
improve our schools when we led often difficult and long efforts to 
upgrade the standards in american education and to improve the 
quality of instruction our children were receiving  
	     
	     there were no two governors whom i admired more during 
that period than the two who now stand on this stage with the teacher 
of the year  and i think both of them would join me in saying that 
after all the testimony has been heard and all the bills have been 
passed and the funds have been raised and allocated it all comes 
down to what happens between the teacher and the students in the 
classroom
	     
	     that is why todays ceremony honoring the national 
teacher of the year is so important  tracey leon bailey is one 
recognition all across our country for highly advanced and innovative 
science programs  he is developed and introduced into floridas 
classrooms cuttingedge programs in molecular biology and dna 
fingerprinting  subjects usually taught only in college and i 
might add probably only dimly understood here in the nations 
capital  laughter
	     
	     within three years of being hired by a satellite high 
school mr baileys institution had one of the strongest science 
programs in the entire state of florida and it won numerous national 
and international awards  these advanced programs are not just for a 
favored few  tracey bailey has inspired all kinds of students 
including those previously known as lowachieving or atrisk to reach 
for excellence and to attain it  this is what our students need and 
what our country needs 
	     
	     today we know that a good future with high wages and 
rich opportunities rests on the foundation of quality education for a 
lifetime  the basics are not enough anymore  all our kids need 
competence in math and science and advanced problemsolving  that is 
why tracey baileys accomplishments are so important and why i am so 
pleased and proud to participate in recognizing and honoring these 
accomplishments 
	     
	     tracey you represent the best in the united states  
i am glad to recognize you today and to formally present you with this 
apple award as the teacher of the year for one thousand nine hundred and ninetythree  applause  
	     
	     mr bailey  thank you mr president  it is indeed a 
great honor and a tremendous responsibility to represent the nations 
twofive million teachers  and we appreciate the support that you have 
shown for education and we are looking forward to working with you to 
help redesign and improve our nations schools  
	     
	     we know that the quality of our childrens education 
will directly impact the future of our economic and social landscape 
in the years to come  and we thank you so much for your continued 
support and commitment to our childrens education  thank you again  
applause

	     the president  in closing i would like to also welcome 
the education leaders in florida who are here those representing the 
national education groups who have also come  i would like to recognize 
traceys congressman representative jim bacchus in the back himself 
a great advocate of education  and i would like to remind all of you 
that the ultimate purpose of the national teacher of the year award 
is to find a way for the rest of us to express our appreciation to 
people all across this country who give their lives to our children 
all of the teachers of this country who get up every day and do their 
best to try to advance the because of learning for all the children of 
america  they are in so many ways our most important public 
servants
	     
	     thank you very much  applause

michael sells  writes

 this is not a fresh case of
ethnic cleansing but just another chapter in the continuing saga
of intense mutual hatred destruction 

every place on earth is the scene of a saga of mutual hatred and
destruction  the holocaust was not a fresh case  it was another
chapter in a nine hundred year history of attacks on jews in europe  that did not
make it acceptable and balkan history does not make the genocide against
bosnian muslims acceptable

i guess that it was not acceptable because germany also chose
a path of aggression simultaneously that put the interests of
other countries in peril i wonder whether us or other countries
would have risked themselves if only jews were persecuted and
hitler had no imperialist ambitions i am no student of history
and i am just asking questions

if even for a moment you think that i am condoing ethnically
motivated violence and killings you are dead wrong let me
assure i am not my only question is this do powerful countries
have a moral obligation to interefere in other countries if
their own interests are not threatened i cite an essay by
charles krauthammer in the time this week that discusses
this issue eloquently

for example did us and other european countries abandon their
moral compunctions when they chose not to send military troops
to bombay when hindus in a rare fit of impassioned rage killed
many muslims recently i think not

under what conditions should us interfere in foregin countries
is an abstraction one must clarify before resorting to acrimonious
accusations of religious bigotry and such

subject re key registering bodies
organization netcom online communication services four hundred and eight two hundred and fortyonenine thousand seven hundred and sixty guest
lines twentynine

       since the law requires that wiretaps be requested by the executive
branch and approved by the judicial branch it seems clear that one
of the key registering bodies should be under the control of the
judicial branch  i suggest the supreme court or regionally the
courts of appeal  more specifically the offices of their clerks

       courts already operate substantial recordkeeping operations  some
of these records are confidential  so the concept of a court holding
information in confidence in accordance with law has longstanding legal 
precedents  the judiciary is more immune to pressure from the executive
branch than any executive branch agency or contractor can be  so judicial
control of keys is appropriate

       for the other half of the key i suggest a unit of congress the
general accounting office  the gao is congresss staff unit for keeping
tabs on the executive branch and has an excellent reputation  it is
controlled strictly by congress the executive branch has no authority
over it

       with keys split between the legislative and judicial branches
we might have a chance of this system working honestly  if of course
a way can be found to keep the keys from being siphoned off before
they reach the repositories

       this should not be construed as an endorsement by me of the
whole clipper concept  but if we have to have it splitting control
across all three branches of government might make it work

 it would seem that a society with a failed government would be an ideal
 setting for libertarian ideals to be implemented  now why do you suppose
 that never seems to occur
 
advances in freedom have been made in the past  the divine right of
king concept was questioned at one time and may have used the same
argument that it had not come about before  but our ancestors had the
courage to throw off the old system that said that one man ruling many
was necessary to have a decent wholesome society  in the one thousand eight hundreds the 
concept of slavery was questioned  our ancestors had the courage to
question a practice that had existed for thousands of years  was
the idea that one man owning another necessary to have a decent 
wholesome society  now libertarians question the necessity of
majoritarianism  is it necessary that many people rule over many
others to have a decent wholesome society

    i am a serious motorcycle enthusiast without a motorcycle and to
put it bluntly it sucks  i really would like some advice on what would
be a good starter bike for me  i do know one thing however i need to
make my first bike a good one because buying a second any time soon is
out of the question  i am specifically interested in racing bikes cbr
six hundred ftwo gsxr seven hundred and fifty  i know that this may sound kind of crazy
considering that i have never had a bike before but i am responsible a
fast learner and in love  

responsible and in love  i believe that is a contradiction
in terms

unless you are really brave read reckless a five hundredcc sport
bike will go way faster than you dare for at least your first
year of riding  getting more than that really is overkill
as you will never even want to use it  the following bikes
can be bought and repaired cheaply are easy for a novice
to manage and are plenty high performance
    kawasaki exfive hundred
    honda vffive hundred interceptor
    suzuki gsfive hundred and fiftye

the zeroone hundredmph time of the exfive hundred at full throttle is way
sooner than you are ready for it    with something
as small as a two hundred and fifty you would probably be wishing for more
power pretty quickly unless it is a tzr or rgv 

now i am not saying that you are one hundred certain to kill
yourself immediately with a six hundredftwo or a gsxrseven hundred and fifty  plenty
of people have started riding on those bikes and done
just fine  what i am saying is that it is a waste of
money and a waste of perfectly good plastic when you
drop the thing learning how to balance while stopping
you will never get the throttle more than half open
anyway so why spend the extra two thousand bucks

i think the obvious answer which may have been posted but i have not

replyto cclilleymccacuk
organization computer graphics unit mcc
lines ninetysix


in article  geoffwextrouccsuozau
geoffrey warren hicks writes

posted on behalf of craig southeren who does not have access to
a net account


can anyone provide me with a colour space transform that would
emulate the effects of redgreen colour blindness i have had
a quick look in the computer graphics literature with no results
perhaps someone who has access to medical information could help
 
certainly reference follows 

bear in mind that there are at least two conditions which may be called
redgreen colour blind one protanopia is caused by a lack or major
dysfunction of the l cones those that respond best to long
wavelengths this gives much reduced redgreen and redviolet discrimination and
also means that reds look dimmer than than they do to people with normal vision

the other deuteranopia is due to missing or dysfunctional m cones although it
can also be caused by a lack of the lm cone difference signals in the retina
it also gives reduced redgreen discrimination but redviolet is unaffected 
unlike protanopia reds are not dimmer than  normal

on a uniform chromaticity diagram  the horseshoe shaped one you see in computer
graphics books  there is a single confusion point for each type of colour
deficiency colours which are confused lie on straight lines radiating from this
point for protanopia the point is at youzerosixtyonevzerofiftyone very close to the far red
corner for deuteranopia the point is at youfourseventyfive vonethirtyone

note that different experimental investigations in the literature give slightly
different values for these depending on the precise details of the experimental
setup random errors and so on the values quoted are typical

so if all colours on a line are seen as the same which colour is actually seen

this problem has now been solved tests on people with one normal eye and one
affected eye have shown that there is an axis for each type of disorder onto
which all the colours collapse for protanopes this joins up four hundred and seventythreenm and five hundred and seventyfournm on
the spectral locus the edge of the horseshoe for deuteranopes the line is
very similar  joining four hundred and seventysevennm and five hundred and seventyninenm

so to convert colours from normal vision to a simulated protanopia or
duuteranopia

one plot the colour on a uniform chromaticity diagram
two construct a line from this point to the appropriate confusion point
three find the intersection of this line with the appropriate axis line
four this is the new chromaticity 

the best reference for this is meyer gw  greenberg dp one thousand nine hundred and eightyeight colour
defective vision and computer graphics displays ieee computer graphics and
applications eightfive twentyeightforty

you will also need a decent reference on basic colour science if you are not
familiar with the cie xyz colour model and the uniform chromaticity scale diagram

i would like to write a program probably a ppm filter to allow
previewing of images to check for sufficient contract for colour
blind users not being colour blind myself this is a bit difficult

yes this is certainly possible you will need the chromaticities of the red
green and blue phosphors of the monitor you intend to display the images on and
the chromaticity of the white point this information can be measured or
obtained from the manufacturer i posted a list of some monitor chromaticities a
couple of weeks ago

the procedure for each pixel  is as follows some lookup tables might be a
help here

a convert rgb to cie xyz this is a simple threethree matrix multiplication once you
have the monitor data
b retaining the y component for later convert xyz to chromaticity coordinates youv
using you  fourxxfifteenythreez v  nineyxfifteenythreez
c find the equation of the line as in step two above
d find the intersection as in step three
e convert back from youv to xyz using the y value from step a
f ensure that this new colour can be displayed on your monitor if not move it
along a line in xyz space towards neutral grey ie half way between black and
white until it is displayable

please email replies  i will summarise and repost if there is
sufficient interest

done also posted for the rest of us

lines twentynine

   why does a lead acid battery discharge and become dead totally unuseable
 when stored on a concrete floor  

when will people learn

the trouble is the ballast in the concrete and as every fool knows ballast 
resistors are used to discharge batteries furthermore it is very silly to 
store the battery with the terminals downwards as you must have done to 
contact the ballast 

seriously self discharge the actual problem as stated by others does vary 
greatly with certain types and freaks show low self discharge i have in 
fact seen ordinary automotive batteries which have effectively held full 
charge for  two years so it must be possible

if your garage is heated store the batteries somewhere cooler but above 
freezing flat batteries freeze more easily occasionally charge it once a 
month or even leave it on float charge permanently special charger 
do not do this unless you know what you are doing seriously dangerous

anouther point is the unsuitability of automotive batteries for things like 
electric mowers  they are not generally designed to be repeatedly deep 
discharged and their life may be greatly shorted some early zero maintenance 
automotive batteries in fact responded to a full discharge with total failure 
shortly afterwards but modern ones are superb sixyrs ninetyfive thousand miles and 
counting

 one the double speed of cdthree hundred is achievable only on machines

 two the double speed is a prerequisite for photocd multisession

 three which means i seem to gain nothing compared with say cdone hundred and fifty
 
 any comments
 thanx
 

  your source is wrong  the double speed cdthree hundred is still slow compared to a
typical hard disk  the lc can easily handle the scsi transfer rate of the
cdthree hundred  none of the current macs even the quadras support scsitwo unless
you get a scsitwo nubus card

  you do not have to have double speed to use photocd  it is just faster
reading images off of a disk  i think that the cdone hundred and fifty can handle photocd
but only single session  the cdthree hundred can do multisession photocd

nonreligious reasons for having a moment of silence for a dead

to give the friends a moment to remember their classmate in the

prayer types have tried to use a moment of silence as a way
to get prayer back at my high school for instance our dear

i can certainly see opposing the amen  but that does not require

alan two  we can also analyze to whom the lord is addressing marvel
alan not that i said unto thee ye must be born again john threeseven
alan here jesus is clearly directing his remarks to nicodemus  a
alan ruler of the jews not a child

yes but jesus also made a very general and doctrinal statement
in the same conversation

flesh gives birth to flesh but the spirit gives birth to spirit
john threesix

clearly infants are not born of the spirit  thus without baptism
they are unspiritual  they are not born with the image of god but in
adams fallen image cf gen fivethree  they have no righteousness of
their own just as adults have no righteousness of their own  there
is only the imputed righteousness of christ which believers receive
through faith

alan three  we can ask ourselves why the lord would even introduce the
alan concept of spiritual rebirth through baptism if newborn babies
alan were not free from sin

your point is a little obscure here but i think you are saying
that christ used the innocence of newborn babes as a metaphor
for spiritual rebirth  but this is not what he did
if you look at the text he did not speak
of spiritual rebirth but of spiritual birth  we are
born of the spirit once not twice or several times
we are also born of the flesh once  the lord makes it
clear that these are separate and different events
it is true that other scriptures refer to spiritual
birth as rebirth because it is a second birth
for example titus threefive  but it is not a second
spiritual birth

the only thing the two births have in common is the concept of birth
which is used as a symbol of new life  not of innocence  when an
infant is born or conceived a new life is begunbut it is neither
innocent nor righteous  similarly when that same individual is
baptized or perhaps when they believe prior to baptism they begin a
new life in christ romans sixthree colossians twotwelve titus threefive ephesians
twofive  then the believer has gods assurance of the forgiveness of
their sins and of christs imputed righteousness

qzero  what is gopher

azero  the internet gopher clientserver provides a distributed
     information delivery system around which a worldcampuswide
     information system cwis can readily be constructed   while
     providing a delivery vehicle for local information  gopher
     facilitates access to other gopher and information servers
     throughout the world 


qone  where can i get gopher software

aone  via anonymous ftp to boomboxmicroumnedu  look in the directory

qfour  who develops gopher software

afour  gopher was originally developed in april one thousand nine hundred and ninetyone by the university
     of minnesota microcomputer workstation networks center to help
     our campus find answers to their computer questions  

     it has since grown into a fullfledged world wide information
     system used by a large number of sites in the world

     many people have contributed to the project too numerous to
     count 

     the people behind the much of the gopher software can be reached
     via email at gopherboomboxmicroumnedu or via paper mail

qfive what is the relationship between gopher and wais  ftp

afive gopher is intimately intertwined with these two other systems
     as shipped the unix gopher server has the capability to 
     
        search local wais indices
        query remote wais servers and funnel the results to gopher
         clients
        query remote ftp sites and funnel the results to gopher
         clients
        be queried by www world wide web clients either using
         built in gopher querying or using native http querying

     yeah as information trickles in funny how that works
 
 funny yeah funny how you did not wait for the fbi spokesdroid 
 latest reversal of facts before proclaiming the bds burned
 themselves to death
 
 if you will not believe anything the government says and the press
 is not reliable according to the same logic then what do you base
 your statements on  wild speculation laced with a healthy dose
 of paranoia

funny brent but so far we have heard two versions of the facts

one what the government says  this includes what the government says that
   two survivors have said

two what koreshs lawyer who was actually inside the compound says
   including what he says that most of the survivors have said

strange but they seem to disagree in most important particulars

if anyone has actually seen news reports of any of the survivors
speaking firsthand feel free ot pitch in  i may have missed it
but my money is that their story will sound a hell of a lot like
case two and not at all like case one

since neither side would be particularly interested in telling the truth
you have to weigh the facts given by each yourself and weigh it with
the newsreporting if you care

many cult members will probably side with the attorney and if he
is lying change their stories to match his  and if the feds also
lie the cult members who become disillusioned will change their
stories to match the feds  

neither sides are interested in the truth  the media is more interested
but usually either do not have the time to get it straight or tie themselves
to the ratings and deliberately distort  

for me though the black soot billowing outside the compound added with
how fast the fire spread ponted to someone dousing large parts of the
compound with some sort of gasoline or firestarter  i doubt the feds
did that as they were more interested in arresting vernon  the real
unbalanced one at least the one that lost his cool was vernon so
i figured that he was more likely to do it after all he was jesus 
being persecuted by the authorities and had followers to hold onto
so made the decision  he and his followers also probably felt that they
were rocketing to heaven by doing this stuff  thsi conclusion i came
to after umpteen million hours of listening to npr and other radio
shows i always have the radio going when i am in my office on some
innocuous talkshow or news program as background noise

ilyess sez 
  so how would have you defended saudi arabia and rolled 
  back the iraqi invasion were you in charge of saudi arabia 
  
  all muslims knew that the whole thing was set up to destroy iraq not 
  to liberate kuwait the people who were killed by the invasion are 
  more many many more than the ones that were killed by the iraqis 
  in their smaller invasion i lived in the west and i have seen how 
  your media prepared you helpless naive americans for a war against 
                                                     
no doubt you plan on exploiting helpless naive americans for your own
purposes hmmlet us see 

  iraq even before the artificial conflict between iraq and kuwait that 
  led to the invasion as the cia correctly predicted and pretended to 
  be surprised not to know 
  it just happened that saddam was so predictible and so arrogant and stupid 

  what would i have done most muslims would choose three hundred dead kuwaitis   over 
  two hundredzero dead iraqis and one thousand dead kuwaitis the first case would happen 
  if no western intervention happened and the second case was a direct 
  or indirect result of western envolvement 

possibly if two hundredzero iraqis had indeed died but this number is based on
greenpeace estimates  greenpeace had compromised its alleged
impartiality during the war by condemning the potential environmental
consequences of allied miiltary action while initially completely
ignoring iraqs horrible environmental crimes starting with the dumping
of millions of barrels of oil into the gulf at ahmadi to the blowing of
over seven hundred oil wells  what is the real number  there has been a lot of
work on this in the last two years none of it reported as the
greenpeace figure seems to get continuously bandied about  the real
number seems to be around tenzero on the same order as the number of
kuwaitis killed tortured and kidnapped during the occupation  i have
included an article i recently posted below but this is really old
news  independent television news reported a figure around fifteenzero only
a few months after the war but it was hardly reported 

for the allies to have killed two hundredzero iraqis they would have had to
kill twice the total number of iraqis in kuwait 

the favored image of the hysterics is the last battle of the war at
mutla  this was yet another example of the american and european media
playing into the hands of iraq and its de facto allies     the
destruction of the iraqi convoy at mutla was portrayed as an allout
slaughter  this is simply not true  the head and tail of the convoy
was bombed initially resulting in a lot of casualties at these points 
 before bombers came back most of the rest of the iraqi soldiers fled
on foot 

furthermore your estimates of kuwaiti war dead if allies had not invaded
is completely ridiculous  you have acknowledged certainly implicitly 
 that saddam is a barbarous brute  you have acknowledged the hundreds
of thousands he has been responible for killing in his own country 
you know that the man he appointed as governor of kuwait  ali majid
was his most brutal henchman presiding over the near genocide of the
kurds  in the late eightys and more recently the shia    yet when it
comes to his treatment of kuwaitis he is an angel  in your estimate
he would have killed fewer than he already had when the war started 
what a joke 


apn  threenine six  iraq war dead 

copyright one thousand nine hundred and ninetythree the associated press all rights reserved 

by nick ludington 
 associated press writer 
   washington ap  after the persian gulf war ended the world was
told that 
as many as one hundredzero iraqi soldiers were killed at one point even baghdad put 
the toll that high as did the yous defense intelligence agency in private 
   but yous officials have been backpedaling ever since even though the 
pentagon has yet to settle on an official estimate to release to the public 
now one former dia analyst says the number of iraqi troops killed may
have been 
as low as onefive hundred 
   that conclusion by john heidenrich writing in the current issue of the 
quarterly magazine foreign policy represents the lowest estimate yet
from yous 
defense sources 
   the revisions suggesting a less devastating iraqi toll fit a pattern of 
vastly moderated yous military claims in the months after the war ended
claims 
for a number of yous weapons also were scaled down 
   despite the dramatic videotapes of successful weaponry or the shocking 
pictures of iraqs disastrous retreat from kuwait arguments have continued 
unabated about what really happened in the gulf war 
   heidenrich is not the first to question the iraqi death toll numbers that 
originally were aired more that a year ago air force lt gen charles
horner 
the commander of the air campaign in the gulf war said he believed the iraqi 
military death toll was fewer than tenzero for the entire war 
   the pentagon itself still refuses to provide an estimate of the number of 
iraqis who died in the fortytwoday war against the yousled coalition in
january and 
february one thousand nine hundred and ninetyone on monday pentagon spokesman lt cmdr joe gradisher
reiterated 
past statements that there just is not a number that is credible 
   but some current internal estimates range from eightzero to twentyfivezero iraqi troops 
killed said one analyst speaking on condition of anonymity who is familiar 
with the pentagons reports 
   allied deaths were put at one hundred and fortysix americans thirtyfive by friendly fire twentyfour british nine 
by american fire two frenchmen one italian and thirtynine among various arab allies 
   of the postwar reassessments the most widely publicized was the armys 
reluctant acknowledgement months later that its touted patriot air defense 
system was nowhere near so effective as claimed against iraqs scud missiles 
the bush administration initially claimed an almost perfect record for the 
patriot last spring it revised the hit ratio to sixty percent 
   the success record of the navys tomahawk hightech cruise missile used 
against targets in baghdad and other parts of iraq also turned out to be more 
modest than initially indicated by the pentagon 
   the first iraqi casualty figures to surface after the war came in a
may one thousand nine hundred and ninetyone 
report by the environmental group greenpeace which said one hundredzero to one hundred and twentyzero 
iraqi soldiers were killed it estimated that fivezero to fifteenzero iraqi civilians 
were also killed 
   the same month published reports said the defense intelligence agency 
estimated one hundredzero iraqi soldiers were killed and three hundredzero wounded in the
air and 
ground campaigns  although the agency qualified that by saying the estimate 
could be off by as much as fifty percent in either direction 
   but as more information became available those figures gradually were 
revised downward 
   the house armed services committee staff estimated ninezero dead and seventeenzero 
wounded after a review last year 
   but heidenrich writing in the current issue of the quarterly foreign
policy 
estimated the total death toll from both the air and ground offensives
as low as 
onefive hundred  with about threezero wounded 
   heidenrich based the conclusion in his article on the number of
bodies found 
and buried by yous troops  five hundred and seventyseven  and on prisoner of war interviews
he noted 
that only about twozero of sixtyninezero iraqi prisoners of war were wounded 
   based on the calculation that about half as many wounded escaped as were 
captured he put the number of wounded at about threezero using a conservative 
ratio of one dead to two wounded applicable to third world armies like
iraq he 
set battlefield deaths at onefive hundred 
   maybe the figures are too low he wrote maybe the real death toll
on the 
battlefield was twozero or threezero or even sixzero even then the evidence
suggests a 
death toll of well below one hundredzero  or even tenzero 
   in an interview he said the one hundredzero figure was obviously off base
because it 
would mean that virtually all the iraqi soldiers in the kuwait theater of 
operations were casualties 
   he said todays bloodiest wars were not those fought with high technology 
but rather the drawnout conflicts such as those in yugoslavia and somalia

does anyone have a source for three hundred and eightysixdxtwentyfive motherboards  i have
been calling around the local stores and everyone appears

how difficult is it to modify a three hundred and eightysixdxforty motherboard to run at

i have been looking over the postings about the clipper chip and noticed
an interesting omission from the discussion

you all mention that the algorithm is classified and have expressed 
concerns and ideas of how to figure out the algorithm using software

the question that i have is why cannot someone take one of these chips
and reverse engineer it i mean take the thing to a chip testing
analysis facility one with a decent electron microscope just pry
off the top of the chip and start scanning it with the electron
microcope and figure out the circuitry i remembered a place that i use
to work for had one of these facilities that they used to analyze chips
that we accidently blew out while running tests they could actually find
the area that was fried and show us where in the circuit it was 

i am sure that many companies and universities must have these facilities
and that the potential is there especially at a university where the
security at such a facility is looser for someone to take a clipper
apart and analyze it

what can the government do to prevent this start taking away all 
microchip analysis facilities and electron microscopes

apart from the suggestion that appeared in the letters column of
skeptical inquirer recently has there been any further mention
about a possible asimov commemorative stamp  if this idea has not
been followed up does anyone know what needs to be done to get
this to happen  i think that its a great idea  should we start a
petition or something

i believe that there is a ten year period from time of death until
a person can be on a commemorative stamp  it was broken once
for lyndon johnson i think but other than that it has held for
awhile  of course we can still start now  the elvis stamp
was petitioned for ages and things really moved once it got
past the ten year anniversary of his death

from myths and facts by leonard j davis near east research inc
one thousand nine hundred and eightynine

pp one hundred and eightone hundred and nine

    unlike the plos almost exclusive focus on civilian targets the
one hundred troups from the irgun and stern group that struck at deir yassin
on april ten one thousand nine hundred and fortyeight targeted the village for its military importance
deir yassin was on the road to jerusalem which the arabs had

since facts and myths does not even know where deir yassin was
why should we pay any attention to the rest of what it says

blockaded and it housed iraqi troups and palestinian irregulars
snipers based in deir yassin were a constant threat to jewish citizens
in jerusalem

    arab civilians were killed at deir yassin but that attack does
not conform to the propaganda picture that the arabs have tried to
paint the number of arabs killed was generally reported to be about
two hundred and fifty in one thousand nine hundred and eightythree however eric silver of the guardian britain
interviewed a survivor mophammed sammour who testified that one hundred and sixteen out
of a population of eight hundredone thousand were killed about three days after the
massacre sammour explained representatives of each of the five
clans in deir yassin met at the moslem offices in jerusalem and made a
list of the people who had not been found alive we went through the
names  nothing has happend since one thousand nine hundred and fortyeight to make me think this figure
was wrong

this account from eric silver is the only valid point that mf makes
you can find it together with other evidence and analysis in 
silvers biography of begin  also in silvers book you will find
documentary evidence that nearly everything else in mfs account
is pure bullshit

    unlike the plos deliberate attacks on civilians the killing of
civilians at deir yassin was not premeditated the attackers left open
an escape corridor from the village and more than two hundred residents left
unharmed after the remaining arabs feigned surrender and then fired
on the jewish troops some of the attackers killed arab soldiers and
civilians indiscriminately independent observers told the guardian
that among the bodies they found arab men disguised as women

this is pretty disgusting  the guardian was told of one or two
feeble old men who dressed in womens clothing in a pathetic 
attempt to escape death  see silvers book

lesson of the stumblingblock for those who have an ear to hear 	
                                                
what about those who do not know the masters voice  does the master
not care about them  eloquent but corrupt preaching may be of little
difference to you  but i suspect it made a big difference to all of

i have a four hundred and eightysixthirtythree ibm clone with two serial ports comone comtwo and mouse port
both the serial ports are directly sitting on the mother board  i tried to
install a two thousand four hundred buad hayes internal modem but it does not work  once i dial any
number the system locks  i do not hear any click or ring before it the system
hangs  the modem has a two pin dip switch to select the appropriate port  once 
i change the settings on the dip switch the system starts working again

then i bought a two thousand four hundred baud hayes external modem and checked the system  it
works fine with both the serial ports  the internal modem has been checked on
another machine and it works fine but does not work on my machine

can anyone please help me to find the problem

thanks

 it was called a bricklin

bricklins were manufactured in the seventys with engines from ford

waitaminnit did not the bricklin have an pugeot sixcylinder  or am i
confusing it with the delorean  i was sure the delorean had a veight


the delorean had the yucky prv vsix engine a jointventure between peugout note 
spelling renault and volvo prv this engine is a mighty boring piece of
junk with approx one hundred and fortyhp does not like revs at all

if you look at the delorean in the movie back to the future you will note
that they changed the engine sound to a big veight a real delorean does not sounds
half as good you will also note that every time they have to spin the tires
in the movie the ground is all wet this is because a delorean cannot make
a burnout on a dry road the weak engine that is mounted over the rear axle
makes it almost impossible

is given at the end of this file



 changes in version zeronine update from vzeroeightyone to vzeronine

	in this version we have revised cosypak to take advantage of 
the more robust signal processing functions available in mathematica vtwoone  
since mathematica twoone provides a better  and  working 
laplacetransform and inverselaplacetransform functions than 
mathematica vtwozero did we adopted them this has made cosypak 
smaller thus brian evans signal processing packages that supported 
the laplacetransform  and inverselaplacetransform functions in the 
cosypak vzeroeightyone are no longer needed directly by cosypak vzeronine for 
power users who  use signal processing we still recommend the use of the very  
fine  brian evans package on signal processing available at 
the anonymous  ftp site gausseedspgatechedu  or  ip  one hundred and thirtytwo hundred and seventwo hundred and twentysixtwentyfour  on  
the  downside the disadvantage of this update 
can be that mathematica twoone requires more runtime resources than its 
previous version 


	
 for mathematica twozero users
	
	we have included the laplacetransform package from mathematica twoone in  
the directory fortwozero please move all files and directory under fortwozero into  
the calculus directory under mathematica packages directory 


	    
 introduction
   
    this is an unsupported release of cosypak  a control systems 
analysis package for symbolic control systems analysis using 
mathematica twoone classical control systems analysis and design methods and some  
modern control systems methods have been implemented in this package 
    
    this package and the attendant notebooks were developed on a 
next tm computer a unix based workstation they have been 
used as a supplementary teaching aid along with  standard control 
engineering texts ogata one thousand nine hundred and ninetyone phillips and harbor one thousand nine hundred and ninetyone for 
undergraduate courses in control engineering i taught at the systems 
engineering department of cwru in addition to the next they have 
also been tested successfully on apple macintosh computers tm and 
ibm pcs tm running ms windowstm we would be very much interested 
to hear from you if you or anybody you know uses this software on 
platforms not mentioned above ibm users however will have to 
evaluate the notebooks first to visualize the graphics

    once installed see below for instructions this  collection  of  
mathematica  packages  can be loaded by any user bundled with the 
packages are many notebooks cosynotes which demonstrate  
the functionality of these packages the notebooks follow a plan of 
many fine standard undergraduate control engineering text books

 compressed files

        the files that contain  a  complete set of the cosypak vzeronine
packages and notebooks for mathematica are

 cosypakninetarz     		compressed tar file for unix systems
	
 cosypakninesithqx     	compressed sit file for macintosh 
 				systems and encoded by binhex fourzero 
				format requires the   shareware
				 stuffit file v onefiveone or higher 
	
 cosypakibmninezip    	zip file for the ibm pc running msdos
    
     once expanded the mathematica files can also be used on 
macintosh  ibm pc  unix systems also


 installation of cosypak

 o in unix command line type the following command

      zcat cosypakninetarz  tar xvf 

 o in macintosh open the sithqx file using the shareware
    stuffit v onefiveone or higher
  
 o in ibm command line type the following command

      pkunzip o d cosypakibmninezip

note this zip file was zipped by zip utility vtwozero you must use 
pkunzip version twozero or  higher to unzip it  ibm pcs may limit the 
directory name characters to eight in that event type pkunzip o d 
cosypakzip  you can also unzip the cosypakibmninezip file on any 
unix machine if you have unzip utility on it


     uncompressing and untarring cosypakninetarz or unzipping 
cosypakibmninezip will create a directory called cosypak
         	
once the files are expanded you should see a single directory 
cosypak containing the following three files four 
subdirectories and their contents

subdirectories in cosypak  
  cosypak     contains control tool box packages

 important 	

	the notebook example filesma files will be under the 
cosynotes directory  to use the notebooks move the directory cosypak to  
a 
directory that  mathematica can recognize 
	
        locallibrarymathematicapackages     	on a unix machine
        myharddiskmathematicapackages   	on an apple macintosh
        cwinmathpackages                  	on an ibm pc

	at the beginning of the initialization cell of each notebook 
in  cosynotes directory we list the example about how to make 
mathematica identify the directory

	 initialization of path 

	 example for a unix machine  default  
	
	pathjoinpath
	locallibrarymathematicapackages
	
	
	 example for an apple macintosh   
	
	pathjoinpath
	myharddiskmathematicapackages
	
	
	 example for ibm pc 	
	 
	
	pathjoinpath	
	 cwinmathpackages	
		

change the pathname according to your machine by removing the 
mathematica comment sign  and  before and after path 
setting

	this command makes mathematica recognize the directory

        locallibrarymathematicapackages     	on a unix machine
        myharddiskmathematicapackages   	on a apple macintosh
        cwinmathpackages                	on an ibm pc


 mathematica twozero users
	
	we include the laplacetransform package from mathematica twoone in 
the directory fortwozero please move all files and directory under fortwozero 
into the calculus directory under mathematica packages directory 


 getting started

       after installation start mathematica and open the notebooks in 
the cosynotes directory all notebooks load their own packages 
navigate in the notebooks and enjoy ibm users however will have to 
evaluate the notebooks to visualize the graphics

hello
    i am trying to use the bios timer interrupts which occur every fiftyfive
seconds or eighteentwo times a second to time peoples response times in a
psychology experiment and the response times are on the order of one
seconds is there any way i can get better precision than by counting
ticks or can i make the ticks occur more frequently i am trying to do
this in dos fivezero on a three hundred and eightysix and it would be nice if this could also work
on our old eight thousand and eightysix machines running dos twoone i know i know i do not like
them any more than you do but this is by no means a requirement just a
possibility 
    so basically any information on the bios tick scheme and the
related inrterruots would be appreciated as well as any information on
alternate ways of improving accuracy email is preferred as i am
planning on posting this to a few boards and i do not read all of them
thanks

 i find this method much better myself too although i do really
 hate it when the bolt finally comes loose and the wrench and my
 hand both come crashing into my face  after coming to which is
 about fifteen minutes later i change my clothes because by this time
 all the oil has drained on me and ice my entire face and suck
 down about twenty tylenol to ease the pain  later in the day i then
 proceed with refilling the engine oil
 
 it is just crazy how i try and change the oil on my cars in one
 weekendi go through about three bottles of tylenol and two bags of ice

oh that is not so bad every time i try to change the oil i forget to
shut off the engine first the hot oil comes out and scalds me blinds
me then the engine starts to overheat and while i am screaming in agony
and trying to crawl out from under the car i grab the red hot exhaust
pipe and get third degree burns on my hands my screams intensify as i
finally emerge from under the car and i struggle to my feet in front of
the car whereupon the radiator hose ruptures and sprays me with super
heated coolant then the engine seizes but not before the cylinder head
explodes piercing my flesh with fragments of red hot iron

this happens every time i am starting to think i should pay the mechanic
twentyfive instead paying the hospital two hundred and fiftyzero and the dealer twentyfivezero for a new
car this gets costly when you change the oil every three thousand miles

hello folks
i am very happy with my new reightygs  my range is two hundred and thirtyeight miles on foureight gallons
that is fifty mpg  surprisingly the bike is a real cruiser  i was expecting
something rough   she is a sweet backroad honey  and i can go pretty much
anyplace i would take my mountain bike  as far as shaft effect it is more a 
torque effect from the crankshaft in my opinion  rev it sitting still
when the driveshaft is not moving and the bike twists a bit  maybe
i do not ride her fast enough to get a shaft effect but in my opinion

	not to start another shaft effect discussion but the twist you
	feel when revving sitting still is due to the larger flywheels that
	the bmw rbikes maybe ks too do not know use if you whack the throttle
	at stop lights it will really rock the bike over to the right

	 
two i run two lights the standard headlamp plus a sidelamp mounted on the
crash bar  the illuminations excellent that way with a full beam coming
out from the level of the motor left side the lamp beam is linear so
that you get a bright streak of illumination from left to right and it 
really picks up the periphery deer lurking etc  combined with the 
headlamp on high you can see like day  but i have heard that bmw alternators
do not crank out too much  do i need to shut down the sidelamp when i am
puttering around in the dirt at low rpm  

	please post if you come to any conclusion on this i am thinking
	of putting a light on each cylinder guard on my rone hundreds and was
	wondering whether i was going to have to switch lights off every
	time i was under fivezero rpm

janet reno killed the waco children  she is responsible for
their deaths  she should resign immediately  she should have 
understood that david koresh was a madman who would do anything
against the children if he became provoked  all the warning 
signs were there and she ignored them  she provoked koresh
into killing the children

she provoked koresh  excuse me but david koresh killed 
the inhabitants of that compound not a govt official  these people 
were controlled by koreshhe killed them a long time ago
when he refused to release the children and other hostages as you 
call them in your comparison

    this is the first i hear that koresh refused to release
    someone  in fact a lot of people including children came out
    during the standoff

    how do you know koresh killed his followers  the fbi said
    he had had no such plans and they had the place bugged koreshs 
    attorney said the same thing and the survivors claimed that the 
    fire was started by goverment agents
