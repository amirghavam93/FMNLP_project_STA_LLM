# FMNLP_project_STA_LLM        
This repository is for the final project of the FMNLP course.          
The goal of this project is to enhance text clas- sification in low-resource environments by utiliz- ing Selective Text Augmentation (STA) and Large Language Models (LLMs). The motivation stems from the challenge of data scarcity in text classifi- cation, particularly in settings where conventional data enrichment methods are inadequate. By syn- ergizing STA with LLMs, the project aims to im- prove the accuracy and generalizability of text classification models in these challenging con- texts. This approach seeks to demonstrate the ef- fective use of word role categorization in STA and the potential of LLMs in generating realistic, con- textually relevant text augmentations.
